Neon is a fully managed serverless Postgres with a generous free tier.
Neon separates storage and compute and offers modern developer features such as serverless, branching, bottomless storage, and more. Neon is open source and written in Rust.

## Serverless

Neon automatically and transparently scales up compute on demand, in response to application workload. Neon also scales down to zero on inactivity. Since Neon is serverless, it only charges for what you use and can deliver up to a 10x reduction in cost. To learn more, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling), and [Autosuspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).

## Built for developer productivity

Neon allows you to create a branch of your Postgres database. It's easy to create branches for development, test, and staging environments.

Branching is instant and has close to zero overhead, as it is implemented using the "copy-on-write" technique in Neon storage.
In fact, branches are so cheap that you can create a branch for every code deployment in your CI/CD pipeline. To learn more about our branching feature, see [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching).

## Fully managed

Neon provides high availability without any administrative, maintenance, or scaling burden.

## Bottomless storage

Our engineering team has developed a purpose-built, multi-tenant storage system for the cloud.
Neon storage allows virtually unlimited storage while providing high availability and durability guarantees.

Neon storage integrates storage, backups, and archiving into one system. This reduces operational headaches associated with checkpoints, data backups, and restore.

Neon storage is designed with cloud costs in mind and uses a multi-tier architecture to deliver on latency, throughput, and cost. It integrates a cloud object store, such as S3, to push cold data to the cheapest storage medium, and uses locally attached SSDs for low latency, high-performance data. Neon storage is written in Rust for maximum performance and usability.

## Open source

You can find [neondatabase](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) on GitHub. We develop in public under the Apache 2.0 license. For an overview of Neon's architecture, refer to Neon's [architecture documentation](/docs/introduction/architecture-overview).

## Compatibility

Neon compute is the latest version of Postgres. It is 100% compatible with any application that uses the official release of Postgres. Currently, we support [Postgres 14](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14.html), [Postgres 15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15.html), and [Postgres 16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html) (the default). For details refer to the [Postgres compatibility](/docs/reference/compatibility) page.

## Coming soon

Here's a snapshot of what we're working on now:

* [Observability](#observability)
* [Developer workflows](#developer-workflows)
* [Account management](#account-management)
* [More regions](#more-regions)

### Observability

* **Autoscaling charts in the Project Dashboard**

    Continuing with our improvements to monitoring and observability in Neon, our new [Autoscaling graphs](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide#monitor-autoscaling) &#8212; available now when you edit a branch's compute instance &#8212; will soon be added to the Project Dashboard as well.

* **New Monitoring page**

   We are also working on adding a new Monitoring page to the Neon Console that will display key Postgres, connection, and resource usage metrics in a dashboard.

* **For partners, a more granular Consumption API**

  Our current Consumption API provides cumulative consumption metrics across all projects in your account for the selected billing period. We are expanding our APIs to also allow for daily consumption metrics.

### Developer workflows

* **Schema Diff**

    We are currently building a Schema Diff tool that lets you precisely compare database schemas between different branches to help streamline your integration process.

    If there are any new branching features that you think could help your development team's workflow, let us know in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042).

* **Improvements to Vercel integration**

    Some upcoming improvements to the Vercel integration include a method for removing old preview deployment branches, as well as new Neon actions and better error messaging to let you do more right from the Vercel integration drawer.

* **Adding Time Travel Assist to the SQL Editor**

   To help with data recovery workflows, we're making our Time Travel Assist feature available in the SQL Editor in the Neon Console. Time Travel Assist is available now on the **Restore** page, but it's a great feature and we want to make it more convenient for you to use, wherever you might need it in the console.

* **Support for anonymizing data**

   To help with workflows that require protecting personal information, we're adding support for anonymizing data. For example, if you derive your staging branch directly from production, you might want to anonymize the data on staging, which you can then use as the source for all of your development and testing branches.

### Account management

* **Organization support**

    We are adding features to support using Neon in your organization. Later, we'll add support for managing individual teams within the organization as well.

### More regions

* We are currently evaluating new regions. Please reach out on Discord to let us know which region you would like to see next.

## A brief history of Neon

The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February 2022 and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the [Technical Preview](#technical-preview), making Neon available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Neon's [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

In the spring of 2023, Neon launched [paid plans](https://neon.tech/pricing) with new features like Project Sharing, [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling), and [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend). We also added support for US East (N. Virginia)

In the summer of 2023, we released the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli). New features included a configurable [history retention](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore) window as well as support for Postgres 16 and the Isreal (Tel Aviv) region. We also announced [SOC 2 Type 1](https://neon.tech/blog/soc2-type-1#our-journey-to-soc2) compliance.

In the fall of 2023, we added [IP allowlisting](/docs/introduction/ip-allow), email signup, and [logical replication](/docs/introduction/logical-replication). We also announced [SOC 2 Type 2](https://neon.tech/blog/soc2-type2) compliance.

In the winter of 2024, we added support for the Asia Pacific (Sydney) region, [Branch Restore](/docs/guides/branch-restore) with Time Travel Assist, and new [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) plans.

## Technical Preview

Neon sets a high standard for what constitutes a feature-complete product, meaning that all intended core functionality is implemented and operates as expected. While many features may be operational today, there may still be some that are under development or refinement. Neon will remain in Technical Preview while the remaining features are still being developed and perfected.


# Neon architecture

Neon architecture is based on the separation of compute and storage and is orchestrated by the Neon Control Plane, which manages cloud resources across both storage and compute.

A Neon compute runs Postgres, and storage is a multi-tenant key-value store for Postgres pages that is custom-built for the cloud.

![Neon architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/neon_architecture_3.png)

Neon storage consists of three main components: Safekeepers, Pageservers, and cloud object storage.

Safekeepers are responsible for durability of recent updates.
Postgres streams [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](/docs/reference/glossary#wal) to the Safekeepers, and the Safekeepers store the WAL durably until it has been processed by the Pageservers and uploaded to cloud storage.

Pageservers are responsible for serving read requests. To do that, Pageservers process the incoming WAL stream into a custom storage format that makes all [page](/docs/reference/glossary#page) versions easily accessible. Pageservers also upload data to cloud object storage, and download the data on demand.

Neon uses cloud object storage such as S3 for long-term data storage. Stored data is [encrypted at rest](/docs/reference/glossary#data-at-rest-encryption).

Safekeepers can be thought of as an ultra reliable write buffer that holds the latest data until it is processed and uploaded to cloud storage. Safekeepers implement the Paxos protocol for reliability. Pageservers also function as a read cache for cloud storage, providing fast random access to data pages.

A compute node in Neon is a stateless Postgres process due to the separation of storage and compute. It has two main states: `Active` and `Idle`.

`Active` means that Postgres is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, your compute node is automatically placed into an `Idle` state to save on energy and resources. Users on paid plans can disable this auto-suspension behavior so that a compute always remains active, or they can increase or decrease the amount of time after which a compute is placed into an `Idle` state. Auto-suspension behavior is controlled by an **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting. For information about configuring this setting, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

The _Autosuspend_ feature is conservative. It treats an "idle-in-transaction" connection as active to avoid breaking application logic that involves long-running transactions. Only connections that are truly inactive are closed after the defined period of inactivity.

When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation can take anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds, meaning that the first connection may have a higher latency than subsequent connections. Cold-start times are fastest in the `US East (Ohio) â aws-us-east-2` region, which hosts the Neon Control Plane. The Neon Control plane will be deployed regionally in future Neon releases, bringing the same millesecond cold-start times to all supported regions.

Also, Postgres shared memory buffers are cold after a compute wakes up from the `Idle` state, which means that initial queries may take longer until the shared memory buffers are warmed.

After a period of time in the `Idle` state, Neon occasionally activates your compute to check for data availability. The time between checks gradually increases if the compute does not receive any client connections over an extended period of time.

You can check if a compute is `Active` or `Idle` and watch as a compute transitions from one state to another in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or on the **Branches** page.

## Compute configuration

Neon only supports modifying session-level configuration parameters. Parameters are reset when the session terminates, such as when the compute suspends due to inactivity.

For information about Neon's Postgres server configuration, see [Neon Postgres parameter settings](/docs/reference/compatibility#neon-postgres-parameter-settings).

For information about Postgres server configuration, see [Server Configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/runtime-config.html), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.


# Features

# Autoscaling

title: Autoscaling
subtitle: Learn how Neon automatically scales compute resources on demand
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T18:34:05.859Z'

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, available to paying users, dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute endpoint in response to the current load, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Autoscaling benefits

Neon's Autoscaling feature offers the following benefits:

- **On-demand scaling:** Autoscaling helps with workloads that experience variations over time, such as applications with regional or time-based changes in demand.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Autoscaling optimizes resource utilization, ensuring that organizations only pay for required resources, rather than over-provisioning to handle peak loads.
- **Resource and cost control**: Autoscaling operates within a user-defined range, ensuring that your compute resources and associated costs do not scale indefinitely.
- **No manual intervention**: After you enable autoscaling and set scaling limits, no manual intervention is required, allowing you to focus on your applications.

## How to enable autoscaling

You can enable autoscaling when creating a Neon project or afterward using a simple compute configuration dialog. For instructions, see:

- [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project)
- [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint)

## How autoscaling works

A Neon project can have one or more computes, each representing an individual Postgres instance. Storage is decoupled from these computes, meaning that the Postgres servers executing queries are physically separate from the data storage location. This separation offers numerous advantages, including enablement of Neon's autoscaling feature.

![High-level architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/autoscale-high-level-architecture.webp)

Looking more closely, you can see that each Postgres instance operates within its own virtual machine inside a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-cluster), with multiple VMs hosted on each node of the cluster. Autoscaling is implemented by allocating and deallocating [vCPU](/docs/reference/glossary#vcpu) and [RAM](/docs/reference/glossary#ram) to each VM.

![Autoscaling diagram](/docs/introduction/autoscale-architecture.webp)

### The autoscaler-agent

Each [Kubernetes node](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-node) hosts a single instance of the [autoscaler-agent](/docs/reference/glossary#autoscaler-agent), which serves as the control mechanism for Neon's autoscaling system. The agent collects metrics from the VMs on its node, makes scaling decisions, and performs the necessary checks and requests to implement those decisions.

### The Kubernetes scheduler

A Neon-modified [Kubernetes scheduler](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-scheduler) coordinates with the autoscaler-agent and is the single source of truth for resource allocation. The autoscaler-agent obtains approval for all upscaling from the scheduler. The scheduler maintains a global view of all resource usage changes and approves requests for additional resources from the autoscaler-agent or standard scheduling. In this way, the scheduler assumes responsibility for preventing overcommitting of memory resources. In the rare event that a node exhausts its resources, new pods are not scheduled on the node, and the autoscaler-agent is denied permission to allocate more resources.

### NeonVM

Kubernetes does not natively support the creation or management of VMs. To address this, Neon uses a tool called [NeonVM](/docs/reference/glossary#neonvm). This tool is a custom resource definition and controller for VMs, handling tasks such as adding or removing CPUs and memory. Internally, NeonVM utilizes [QEMU](/docs/reference/glossary#qemu) and [KVM](/docs/reference/glossary#kvm) (where available) to achieve near-native performance.

When an autoscaler-agent needs to modify a VM's resource allocation, it simply updates the corresponding NeonVM object in Kubernetes, and the VM controller then manages the rest of the process.

### Live migration

In cases where a Kubernetes node becomes saturated, NeonVM manages the process of [live migrating](/docs/reference/glossary#live-migration) a VM, transferring the VM from one machine to another with minimal interruptions (typically around 100ms). Live migration transmits the internal state of the original VM to a new one while the former continues to operate, swiftly transitioning to the new VM after most of the data is copied. From within the VM, the only indication that a migration occurred might be a temporary performance reduction. Importantly, the VM retains its IP address, ensuring that connections are preserved and queries remain uninterrupted.

The live migration process allows for the proactive reduction of node load by migrating VMs away before reaching capacity. Although it is still possible for the node to fill up in the interim, Neon's separation of storage and compute means that VMs typically use minimal disk space, resulting in fast migrations.

### Memory scaling

Postgres memory consumption can escalate rapidly in specific scenarios. Fortunately, Neon's autoscaling system is able to detect memory usage increases without constantly requesting metrics from the VM. This is accomplished by running Postgres within a [cgroups](/docs/reference/glossary#cgroups), which provides notifications when memory usage crosses a specified threshold. Using cgroups in this way requires running our [vm-informant](/docs/reference/glossary#vm-informant) in the VM alongside Postgres to request more resources from the autoscaler-agent when Postgres consumes too much memory. The vm-informant also verifies that downscaling requests from an autoscaler-agent will leave sufficient memory leftover.

### Local file cache

To expedite queries, the autoscaling system incorporates a Postgres extension that places a cache in front of the storage layer. Many queries benefit from this additional memory, particularly those requiring multiple database scans (such as creating an index). The [local file cache](/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache) capitalizes on the additional memory allocated to the VM by dedicating a portion to the cache to itself. The cache is backed by disk and kept at a size intended to fit in the kernel page cache. Due to the storage model, writebacks are not required, resulting in near-instant evictions. The vm-informant adjusts the local file cache size when scaling occurs through the autoscaler-agent, ensuring seamless operation.

# Autosuspend

title: Autosuspend
subtitle: Scale computes to zero when not in use
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T18:34:05.859Z'
---

Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature controls when a Neon compute instance transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity.

By default, a Neon compute instance scales to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, this setting is fixed. Users on paid plans can increase, decrease, or disable the autosuspend setting, controlling when or if a compute scales to zero.

Reasons for adjusting the autosuspend setting might include:

- **Avoiding cold starts**. Restarting a compute from an `Idle` state can take anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds (see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle)). You can turn off the _Autosuspend_ feature to avoid cold starts.
- **Reducing the frequency of cold starts**. You can configure autosuspend to occur less frequently, keeping your compute active during busier hours while ensuring that it suspends when usage drops off.
- **Suspending a compute more quickly to reduce compute usage**. Compute startup times can be as low as 500 ms, which may be sufficient for your purposes. In this case, you can suspend computes more frequently reduce compute usage.

You can configure the autosuspend setting in an existing project by editing a compute endpoint. You can also configure it when you first create a Neon project, which sets the autosuspend default for the project. For instructions, refer to [Configuring autosuspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

<a id="branches-coming-soon/"></a>

With Neon, you can quickly and cost-effectively branch your data for development, testing, and various other purposes, enabling you to improve developer productivity and optimize continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## What is a branch?

A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data. You can create a branch from a current or past state. For example, you can create a branch that includes all data up to the current time or an earlier time.

A branch is isolated from its originating data, so you are free to play around with it, modify it, or delete it when it's no longer needed. Changes to a branch are independent. A branch and its parent can share the same history (within the defined [point-in-time restore](/docs/reference/glossary#point-in-time-restore) window) but diverge at the point of branch creation. Writes to a branch are saved as a delta.

Creating a branch does not increase load on the parent branch or affect it in any way, which means you can create a branch without impacting the performance of your production system.

Each Neon project is created with a root branch called `main`. The first branch that you create is branched from the project's root branch. Subsequent branches can be branched from the root branch or from a previously created branch.

## Branching workflows

You can use Neon's branching feature in variety workflows.

### Development

You can create a branch of your production database that developers are free to play with and modify. By default, branches are created with all of the data that existed in the parent branch, eliminating the setup time required to deploy and maintain a development database.

![development environment branch](/docs/introduction/branching_dev_env.png)

The following video shows how to create a branch in the Neon Console. For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a branch](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch).

<video autoPlay playsInline muted loop width="800" height="600">
  <source type="video/mp4" src="/docs/introduction/create_branch.mp4"/>
</video>

You can integrate branching into your development workflows and toolchains using the Neon CLI, API, or GitHub Actions. If you use Vercel, you can use the Neon Vercel Integration to create a branch for each preview deployment.

</DetailIconCards>

### Testing

Testers can create branches for testing schema changes, validating new queries, or testing potentially destructive queries before deploying them to production. A branch is isolated from its parent branch but has all of the parent branch's data up to the point of branch creation, which eliminates the effort involved in hydrating a database. Tests can also run on separate branches in parallel, with each branch having dedicated compute resources.

</DetailIconCards>

### Data recovery

If you lose data due to an unintended deletion or some other event, you can restore a branch to any point in its history retention period to recover lost data. You can also create a new point-in-time branch for historical analysis or any other reason.

Neon retains a history of changes for all branches. This shared history provides the basis for a variety of branch restore and reset operations: resetting a branch to its parent, restoring a branch to its history, creating a new branch from a selected point-in-time, and Time Travel queries against the shared history. You can use these features to reset a development branch to main, to recover lost data, as a database backup strategy, or to view the past state of your database.

## History retention

The history retention limit is 24 hours for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, 7 days for [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) plan users, and 30 days for [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan users.

You can configure the **History retention** setting in the Neon Console, under **Project settings** > **Storage**. For further instructions, see [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).
![History retention configuration](/docs/relnotes/history_retention.png)

Increasing the history retention period affects all branches in your Neon project and increases [project storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage). You can scale **History retention** down to zero if reducing storage cost is more important than the ability to restore your data to a past state.

History is retained in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records. As WAL records age out of the retention period, they are evicted from storage and no longer count toward project storage.

# Read replicas

title: Read replicas
subtitle: Maximize scalability and more with Neon's instant read replicas
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T18:34:05.861Z'
---

Neon read replicas are independent read-only compute instances designed to perform read operations on the same data as your read-write computes. Neon read replicas do not replicate data across database instances. Instead, read requests are directed to a single source â a capability made possible by Neon's architecture, which separates storage and compute. The following diagram shows how read-write and read-only compute instances send read requests to the same Neon [Pageserver](/docs/reference/glossary#pageserver).

![Read-only compute instances](/docs/introduction/read_replicas.png)

In data replication terms, Neon read replicas are asynchronous, which means they are _eventually consistent_. As updates are made by read-write computes, Safekeepers store the data changes durably until they are processed by Pageservers. At the same time, Safekeepers keep read-only computes up to date with the latest changes to maintain data consistency.

Neon supports creating read replicas in the same region as your database. Cross-region read replicas are currently not supported. You can expect that feature in a future release.

You can instantly create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the amount of vCPU and memory allocated to each. Read replicas also support Neon's Autoscaling and Autosuspend features, providing you with control over the compute resources used by your read replicas.

<video autoPlay playsInline muted loop width="800" height="600">
  <source type="video/mp4" src="/docs/introduction/read_replicas_demo.mp4"/>
</video>

## Use cases

Neon's read replicas have a number of potential applications:

- **Increase throughput**: By distributing read requests among multiple read replicas, you can achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.
- **Workload offloading**: Assign reporting or analytical workloads to a read replica to prevent any impact on the performance of read-write application workloads.
- **Access control**: Provide read-only data access to certain users or applications that do not need write access.
- **Resource customization**: Configure different CPU and memory resources for each read replica to cater to the specific needs of different users and applications.

## Advantages

Advantages of Neon's read replica feature include the following:

1. **Efficient storage**: With read-only compute instances reading from the same source as your read-write computes, no additional storage is required to create a read replica. Data is neither duplicated nor replicated, which means zero additional storage cost.
2. **Data consistency**: Read-write and read-only compute instances read data from a single source, ensuring a high degree of data consistency.
3. **Scalability**: With no data replication required, you can create read replicas almost instantly, providing fast and seamless scalability. You can also scale read replica compute resources the same way you scale read-write compute resources.
4. **Cost effectiveness**: By removing the need for additional storage and data replication, costs associated with storage and data transfer are avoided. Neon's read replicas also benefit from Neon's [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling) and [Autosuspend](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) features, which enable efficient management of compute resources.
5. **Instant availability**. With an architecture that separates storage and compute, you can allow read-replicas to scale to zero when not in use without introducing lag. When a read replica starts up, it is up to date with your read-write primary almost instantly.

## Get started with read replicas

The first step to leveraging Neon's read replica feature is to sign up for a paid plan. After subscribing, you will be able to create and configure read replicas. To get started, refer to the [Working with read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) guide.

Neon's logical replication feature, available to all Neon users, allows you to stream data from your Neon database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. These destinations might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others.

![Neon logical replication subscribers image](/docs/guides/logical_replication_subscribers.png)

Logical replication in Neon works in the same way as logical replication on a standard Postgres installation, using a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.

Neon's IP Allow feature, available with the Neon [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan, ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). 

You can configure **IP Allow** in your Neon project's settings. To get started, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

Neon supports project deployment in several regions. We recommended that you select the region closest to your application server to reduce latency between your Neon database and your application.

## Available regions

Neon currently supports the following AWS regions:

- US East (N. Virginia) &mdash; `aws-us-east-1`
- US East (Ohio) &mdash; `aws-us-east-2`
- US West (Oregon) &mdash; `aws-us-west-2`
- Europe (Frankfurt) &mdash; `aws-eu-central-1`
- Asia Pacific (Singapore) &mdash; `aws-ap-southeast-1`
- Asia Pacific (Sydney)	&mdash; `aws-ap-southeast-2`
- Israel (Tel Aviv) &mdash; `aws-il-central-1`

## Select a region for your Neon project

You can select the region for your Neon project during project creation. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

All branches and databases created in a Neon project are created in the region selected for the project.

![Select region image](/docs/introduction/project_creation_regions.png)

<Admonition type="note">
After you select a region for a Neon project, it cannot be changed for that project.
</Admonition>

## Move project data to a new region

If you need to move your data to a different region, the following steps are recommended:

1. Create a new project in the desired region. For project creation instructions, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
1. Move your data from the old project to the new project. For instructions, see [Import data from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).

<Admonition type="note">
Neon Free Tier users are limited to a single project. In this case, you can export your data using `pg_dump`, remove your existing project, create a new project in the desired region, and import your data into the new project.
</Admonition>

Moving data to a new Neon project may require downtime if you are moving a production database, as the import procedure may take some time depending on the size of your data. To prevent the loss of data during the import operation, consider disabling writes from your applications before initiating the import operation. You can re-enable writes when the import is completed. Neon does not currently support disabling database writes. Writes must be disabled at the application level.

Neon regularly reviews opportunities for expanding into new regions. We welcome your input regarding where you'd like to see us next. Please share your suggestions or express your interest in specific regions via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or in our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

Neon's plans are designed to meet different user requirements, ranging from hobby projects to enterprise-level production workloads. We also offer custom enterprise plans with volume-based discounts for large teams or database fleets. Refer to our [pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page for an overview of our plans and pricing. 

This page provides additional information to help you understand our plans and find the one that's right for you.

## Pricing plans

Neon offers four pricing plans: [Free Tier](#free-tier), [Launch](#launch), [Scale](#scale), and [Enterprise](#enterprise).

### Free Tier

Neon's Free Tier plan is best for hobby projects, prototypes, and learning Neon. It includes the following usage:

|                                         |                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Projects**                            | 1 Neon project                                                |
| **Branches**                            | 10 branches                                                   |
| **Databases**                           | Unlimited                                                     |
| **Storage**                             | 0.5 GiB                                                       |
| **Compute**                             | Always-available primary branch compute, 5 compute hours (20 _active hours_)/month on branch computes. Free Tier computes have 0.25 vCPU with 1GB RAM. |

In addition, Free Tier users have access to the following Neon features:

- [Autosuspend](#autosuspend): Compute scales to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity.
- [Region availabilty](#region-availability): The Free Tier is available in all supported regions.
- [Project sharing](#project-sharing): Share your project with any Neon user account.
- [Advanced Postgres features](#advanced-postgres-features): Connection pooling, logical replication, and 60+ Postgres extensions
- [All additional features](#additional-features): Includes [point-in-time restore](#point-in-time-recovery) up to **24 hours** in the past, time travel connections, and more.
- [Community support](/docs/introduction/support): Free Tier plan users have access to **Community** support on our [Neon Discord Server](/discord).

<Admonition type="tip" title="Free Tier Compute Allowances">
On the Free Tier, your primary branch compute is always available â it will never be suspended due to running out of compute hours, which means you can always access the data on the primary branch in your Neon project. Branch computes have 20 [active hours](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) (5 [compute hours](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-hour)) per month. If your branch computes exceed this allowance, they are suspended until the allowance resets at the beginning of the month. You can monitor branch compute hours on the [Billing page](/docs/introduction/manage-billing#view-the-billing-page) in the Neon Console. The compute hour allowance for branch computes resets at the beginning of each month. For instance, if you enrolled in the Neon Free Tier in January, the allowance for branch computes resets on February 1st.
</Admonition>

### Launch

The Launch plan provides all of the resources, features, and support you need to launch your application. It's ideal for startups and growing businesses or applications. It includes the following usage:

|                                         |                                                               |

Additionally, the _Enterprise_ plan can be tailored to your specific requirements with:

- Custom pricing with discounts
- Higher resource allowances for projects, branches, storage, and compute
- Customer-owned S3

Enterprise plan users have access to **Enterprise** support, which includes everything offered with the **Priority** plan plus retail customer support, Customer Success Team support, and SLAs. For more information, Neon support plans are outlined on our [Support](/docs/introduction/support) page.

If you are interested in exploring an _Enterprise_ plan with Neon, you can [request an enterprise trial](/enterprise#request-trial) or [get in touch with our sales team](/contact-sales).

## Features

This section describes the features available with one or more of the Neon plans outlined above. 

### Compute features

#### Compute size

Neon supports compute sizes from 0.25 vCPU with 1 GB RAM up to 8 vCPU with 32 GB RAM.

#### Read replicas

Neon read replicas let you instantly scale your application by offloading read-only workloads to independent read-only compute instances. To learn more, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

#### Autoscaling

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute endpoint in response to the current workload, eliminating the need for manual intervention. For more information, refer to our [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling-guide) guide.

#### Autosuspend

Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature controls when a Neon compute instance transitions to an Idle state (scales to zero) due to inactivity. By default, a Neon compute instance scales to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity. For [Neon Free Tier](#free-tier) users, this setting is fixed. Users on paid plans can configure or disable the autosuspend setting, controlling when or if a compute scales to zero.

#### Region availability

Neon supports project deployment in several regions. All Neon users have access to all regions. To learn more, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

#### Max concurrent connections

Neon can support up to 10,000 concurrent connections. See [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

#### Tenant isolation

The Neon Enterprise plan offers tenant isolation, letting you segregate your data resources from other tenants. If you are interested in this feature, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

### Advanced Postgres features

#### Connection pooling

Neon uses [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) to offer connection pooling support.

#### Logical replication

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon database to external destinations, allowing for Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. Stream your data to data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, external Postgres databases, and more. To learn more, see [Get started with logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

#### Postgres extensions

Neon supports a large number of open-source Postgres extensions letting you extend the capabilities of Postgres. See [Supported extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions).

#### Custom extensions

Neon supports custom-built Postgres extensions for exclusive use with your Neon account. See [Custom-built extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#custom-built-extensions).

### Security features

#### IP Allow

Neon's _IP Allow_ feature ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). To learn more, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

#### SOC 2 Report

Paid plan users can request access to Neon's SOC 2 report on our [Neon Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

#### Customer-owned S3

The Neon Enterprise plan supports data storage on customer-owned S3. If you are interested in this feature, please [contact Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

### Additional features

#### Point-in-time restore

Neon's _Point-in-time Restore_ capability lets you instantly restore your database to a point in time in the past. To learn more, see [Branch reset and restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore).

#### Time Travel Assist

Neon's Time Travel Assist feature lets you connect to any selected point in time within your history retention window and run queries against that connection, allowing you to query into the past. See [Time Travel Assist](/docs/guides/branch-restore#time-travel-assist).

#### Web console

Neon's easy-to-use web console allows you to manage Neon from your browser. 

#### Neon CLI

The Neon CLI is a command-line interface that lets you manage Neon directly from the terminal. See [The Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli).

#### Management API

The Neon API is a RESTful API that lets you manage Neon programmatically. See [Get started with the Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

#### Project sharing

All Neon plans support sharing your Neon project with other Neon users, giving them access to your Neon project from all supported interfaces, including the Neon Console, Neon API, and Neon CLI. To learn more, refer to our [Project sharing](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide) guide.

#### Branching

Neon's branching feature lets you branch your data the same way you branch your code. You can instantly create full database copies for development, testing, or any other purpose. You can easily automate database branching using the Neon API, CLI, or GitHub Actions, enabling you to add database branching to your CI/CD pipeline. Branching is often used with deployment platforms such as Vercel to create a database branch for each preview deployment. To learn more, see [Get started with branching](/docs/guides/branching-intro).

## Limits

- The Neon Launch and Scale plans support up to 500 branches, but there is a soft limit of 100 branches to protect your account from unintended usage. To increase your soft limit, please submit a request to [Neon Support](/docs/introduction/support).
- Paid plans have a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect against unintended usage. To increase this limit, please [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support). The simultaneously active compute limit does not affect the primary branch compute, which always remains available.

## Usage allowances

Each of Neon's plans includes **Storage**, **Compute**, and **Project** usage allowances in the base monthly fee as outlined in the following table.

|            | Free Tier                                                    | Launch          | Scale             | Enterprise       |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Monthly fee| $0/month                                                     | $19/month       | $69/month         | Custom           |
| Storage allowance   | 512 MiB                                                      | 10 GiB          | 50 GiB            |  Larger sizes                |
| Compute allowance   | Always-available primary branch compute and 5 compute hours (20 _active hours_)/month on branch computes. | 300 compute hours (1,200 _active hours_)/month | 750 compute hours (3,000 _active hours_)/month  |  Custom                |
| Projects allowance  | 1                                                            | 10              | 50                |  Unlimited                |


The [Enterprise](/docs/introduction/plans#enterprise) plan is fully customizable with respect to allowances. Please contact [Sales](/contact-sales) for more information.

<Admonition type="tip" title="What are active hours and compute hours?">

- An **active hour** is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted. In the table above, _active hours_ are based on a 0.25 vCPU compute size.
- A **compute hour** is one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
- **Compute hours formula**

  ```
  compute hours = compute size * active hours
  ```

</Admonition>

## Extra usage

The [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans permit extra usage beyond the allowances included with the monthly fee. The extra usage types that are available differ by plan, as outlined below:  

|                | Launch   | Scale    |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Extra Storage  | &check;  | &check;  |
| Extra Compute  | &check;  | &check;  |
| Extra Projects |          | &check;  |

The Launch plan does not support extra projects. If you are on the Launch plan and require extra projects, you must upgrade to the Scale plan, which provides higher project allowances.

## How does extra usage work?

Taking advantage of extra usage requires no user action. Extra usage, if supported with your plan, is available by default. If you use more storage, compute, or projects than your monthly allowance provides, the extra usage is automatically added to your monthly bill. The following sections explain _extra usage_ in more detail.

### Storage

Extra storage is available with the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans:
- On the Launch plan, extra storage is billed for in units of 2 GiB at $3.5 each
- On the Scale plan, extra storage is billed for in units of 10 GiB at $15 each

For example, the Launch plan includes an allowance of 10 GiB in the plan's monthly fee. If you exceed 10 GiB of storage, you are automatically billed for an extra storage unit of 2 GiB at $3.5 per unit. If you exceed 12 GiB, you are billed for 2 units of 2 GiB (an extra $7), and so on. It works the same way on the Storage plan, but with 10 GiB units of storage at $15 per unit.

### Compute

Extra compute usage is available with the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans. Extra compute usage is billed by _compute hour_ at $0.04 per hour. For example, the Launch plan has an allowance of 300 compute hours included in the plan's monthly fee. If you use 100 additional compute hours over the billing period, you are billed an extra $4 (100 x $0.04).

### Projects

Extra project usage is available with the [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plan. Extra projects are billed in units of 10. For example, the Scale plan has an allowance of 50 projects. If you use more than 50 projects, you are automatically billed for an extra package of 10 projects at $50 per package. For example, if you use 51 projects, you are billed for 1 package of 10 projects (an extra $50). If you use 61 projects, you are billed for 2 packages of 10 projects (an extra $100), and so on. 

## Learn more about usage metrics

To learn more about Neon **Compute**, **Storage**, and **Project** metrics, see [Usage metrics](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics).

## Neon pricing estimation guide

You can use this guide to estimate your monthly bill with Neon based on your selected plan and estimated usage.

1. [Select your plan](#step-1-select-your-plan)
2. [Monthly base fee](#step-2-monthly-base-fee)
3. [Estimate your usage](#step-3-estimate-your-usage)
4. [Calculate extra usage fees (if applicable)](#step-4-calculate-extra-usage-fees-if-applicable)
5. [Total monthly estimate](#step-5-total-monthly-estimate)

### Step 1: Select your plan

First, select a plan that best fits your requirements. For **Storage**, **Compute**, and **Project** usage allowances, see [above](#usage-allowances), or refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page, which provides a detailed plan comparison and outlines the features included in each plan. The available plans are:

- Free Tier: $0/month
- Launch: $19/month
- Scale: $69/month
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (contact [Sales](/contact-sales) for pricing details)

### Step 2: Monthly base fee

Note the base monthly fee associated with your plan from the list above.

### Step 3: Estimate your usage

Estimate your monthly usage in the following areas to see if any "extra usage" is required beyond what's included in your plan.

- **Storage (GiB)**: How much storage do you expect to use?  Storage includes the size of your data and a history of changes to support features like branching and point-in-time restore. For more information, see [Storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).
- **Compute (Hours)**: How many compute hours will you require? A compute hour is 1 active hour on a compute with 1 vCPU. Neon supports compute sizes ranging from .25 vCPU to 8 vCPU. See [Compute](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#compute) for a compute hour formula you can use to estimate your compute hour usage.
- **Projects**: How many projects you will be running? Neon recommends a project per application or client.

### Step 4: Calculate extra usage fees (if applicable)

Each [plan](/docs/introduction/plans) comes with base allowances for **Storage**, **Compute**, and **Projects**. Based on the plan your usage estimates, calculate any extra fees for exceeding your plan's allowances.

#### For the Launch plan:

The Launch plan supports extra **Storage** and **Compute**. If you need extra projects, you'll need to move up to the Scale plan.

- **Extra Storage**: If you exceed 10 GiB, extra storage is billed in units of 2 GiB at $3.5 per unit.
- **Extra Compute**: If you exceed 300 compute hours, extra compute is billed at $0.04/hour.

#### For the Scale plan:

The Scale plan supports extra **Storage**, **Compute**, and **Projects**.

- **Extra Storage**: If you exceed 50 GiB, extra storage is billed in increments of 10 GiB at $15 per increment.
- **Extra Compute**: If you exceed 750 compute hours, extra compute is billed at $0.04/hour.
- **Extra Projects**: If you exceed 50 projects, extra projects are billed in units of 10 projects at $50 per unit.

### Step 5: Total monthly estimate

Add up the base monthly fee and any applicable extra usage fees to estimate your total monthly bill.

```
Total Monthly Estimate = Monthly Base Fee + Extra Storage Fee + Extra Compute Fee + Extra Project Fee
```

**Launch plan example**:

- Base fee: $19
- Storage usage: 14 GiB (4 GiB over the allowance)
- Compute usage: 350 hours (50 hours over the allowance)
- Extra storage fee: 2 * $3.5 = $7
- Extra compute fee: 50 hours * $0.04 = $2

_Total estimate_: $19 + $7 + $2 = $28 per month

**Scale plan example**:

- Base fee: $69
- Storage usage: 60 GiB (10 GiB over the allowance)
- Compute usage: 800 hours (50 hours over the allowance)
- Project usage: 55 projects (5 projects over the allowance)
- Extra storage fee: 1 * $15 = $15
- Extra compute fee: 50 * $0.04 = $2
- Extra project fee: 1 * $50 = $50

_Total estimate_: $69 + $15 + $2 + $50 = $136 per month

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Adjust your usage estimates as needed to reflect your actual or projected usage.
- For Enterprise plan users, please contact our [Sales](/contact-sales) team for an estimate based on your custom needs.

## Monitoring billing and usage

You can monitor billing and usage for all projects in your Neon account from the **Billing** page in the Neon Console.

1. Navigate to the Neon Console.
1. Select your Profile.
1. Select **Billing** from the menu.

Here you will find the current bill and your current usage for all projects in your Neon account. Usage is reset to zero at the beginning of each month. For example, on the Launch plan, compute usage will be set back to **0/300h** at the beginning of each month.

![Monitor billing and usage](/docs/introduction/monitor_billing_usage.png)

### Monitor usage for a project

You can monitor usage for a single project from the **Usage** widget on your project's **Dashboard** in the Neon Console.

![Monitor usage widget](/docs/introduction/monitor_usage_widget.png)

Here you will find storage and compute usage for the project among other usage metrics. 

#### Interpreting usage

**Compute** usage is tracked in **compute hours**. A compute hour is 1 active hour for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour. 

<Admonition type="note">
On the Free Tier, the primary branch compute is a 0.25 vCPU compute that is always available, so allowances do not apply. You can run your 0.25 vCPU compute on the Free Tier 24/7. Only branch computes on the Free Tier have an allowance, which is the 5 compute hour/month allowance that Free Tier users see on the **Billing** page. On the Free Tier, this is actually 20 hours of usage because Free Tier computes always have 0.25 vCPU. You cannot increase the compute size on the Free Tier.
</Admonition>

**Storage** includes your data size and history. Neon maintains a history of changes to support _point-in-time restore_. On the Free Tier, your default history retention period is 24 hours. The Launch plan supports up to 7 days of history retention, and the Scale plan supports up to 30 days. Keep in mind that history retention increases storage. More history requires more storage. To manage the amount of history you retain, you can configure the history retention setting for your project. See [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).

**What about extra usage?**

The Launch plan supports extra compute usage. The Scale plan supports extra storage, compute, and project usage. Any extra usage allowance is automatically added (and billed for) when you exceed the allowances included in your plan's base fee. See [Extra usage](#extra-usage) for details. If extra usage occurs, it is reflected in your monthly allowance on the **Billing** page. For example, if you allocate an extra 10 GiB of storage when you exceed your 50 GiB storage allowance on the Scale plan, the extra 10 GiB is added to your **Storage** allowance on the **Billing** page.

As described in [How billing works](/docs/introduction/how-billing-works), each of Neon's plans includes [Storage](#storage), [Compute](#compute), and [Project](#projects) usage allowances. The [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans permit extra usage.

This topic describes Storage, Compute, and Project usage metrics in more detail so that you can better manage your plan allowances and extra usage. 

## Storage

Storage is a combination of your data size plus the shared change history that is used to enable branching-related features like [point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore), [query testing](/docs/guides/branching-test-queries), and [reset from parent](/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent).

The following table outlines data storage allowances per month for each Neon plan.

| Plan       | Storage    |
|------------|------------|
| Free Tier  | 512 MiB    |
| Launch     | 10 GiB     |
| Scale      | 50 GiB     |
| Enterprise | Larger sizes |

Extra storage is available with the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans:
- On the Launch plan, extra storage is billed for in units of 2 GiB at $3.5 each
- On the Scale plan, extra storage is billed for in units of 10 GiB at $15 each

### Storage details

_Storage_ is the total volume of data and history stored in Neon, measured in gibibytes (GiB). It includes the following:

- **Data size**

  The size of all databases in your Neon projects. You can think of this as a _snapshot_ of your data at a point in time.

- **History**

  Neon retains a history of changes for all branches to support _point-in-time restore_ and _branching_.

  - _Point-in-time restore_ is the ability to restore data to an earlier point in time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of WAL records. You can configure the history retention period. See [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore). WAL records that age out of the history retention period are evicted from storage and no longer count toward storage.
  - A _branch_ is a virtual snapshot of your data at the point of branch creation combined with WAL records that capture the branch's data change history from that point forward.
    When a branch is first created, it adds no storage. No data changes have been introduced yet, and the branch's virtual snapshot still exists in the parent branch's _history_, which means that it shares this data in common with the parent branch. A branch begins adding to storage when data changes are introduced or when the branch's virtual snapshot falls out of the parent branch's _history_, in which case the branch's data is no longer shared in common. In other words, branches add storage when you modify data or allow the branch to age out of the parent branch's _history_.

    Database branches can also share a _history_. For example, two branches created from the same parent at or around the same time share a _history_, which avoids additional storage. The same is true for a branch created from another branch. Wherever possible, Neon minimizes storage through shared history. Additionally, to keep storage to a minimum, Neon takes a new branch snapshot if the amount of data changes grows to the point that a new snapshot consumes less storage than retained WAL records.

**Storage** is calculated in gibibytes (GiB), otherwise known as binary gigabytes. One gibibyte equals 2<sup>30</sup> or 1,073,741,824 bytes.

## Compute

The following table outlines compute allowances per month for each Neon plan.

| Plan       | Compute                                                                                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free Tier  | Always-available primary branch compute, 5 compute hours (20 _active hours_)/month on branch computes           |
| Launch     | 300 compute hours (1,200 _active hours_)/month                                                                                           |
| Scale      | 750 compute hours (3,000 _active hours_)/month                                                                                            |
| Enterprise | Custom                                                                                                            |

Extra compute usage is available with the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) and [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans##scale) plans. Extra compute usage is billed for at $0.04 per compute hour. For example, the Launch plan has an allowance of 300 compute hours included in the plan's monthly fee. If you use 100 additional compute hours over the monthly billing period, you are billed an extra $4 (100 x $0.04) for the month.

<Admonition type="tip" title="What are active hours and compute hours?">

- An **active hour** is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted. In the table above, _active hours_ are based on a 0.25 vCPU compute size.
- A **compute hour** is one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
- **Compute hours formula**

  ```
  compute hours = compute size * active hours
  ```

### How Neon compute features affect usage

Compute-hour usage in Neon is affected by [autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide), [autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide), and your minimum and maximum [compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) configuration. With these features enabled, you can get a sense of how your compute usage might accrue in the following graph.

![Compute metrics graph](/docs/introduction/compute-metrics2.png)

You can see how compute size scales between your minimum and maximum CPU settings, increasing and decreasing compute usage: compute size never rises above your max level, and it never drops below your minimum setting. With autosuspend, no compute time at all accrues during inactive periods. For projects with inconsistent demand, this can save significant compute usage.

### Compute usage details

Compute hour usage is calculated by multiplying compute size by _active hours_. Neon measures compute size at regular intervals and averages those values to calculate your compute hour usage.

_Active hours_ is the amount of time that your computes have been active. This includes all computes in your Neon project but excludes time when computes are in an `Idle` state due to [auto-suspension](/docs/reference/glossary#auto-suspend-compute) (scale-to-zero).

Compute size in Neon is measured in _Compute Units (CUs)_. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 7 CUs, as outlined below:

| Compute Units | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |
| 7             | 7    | 28 GB  |

A connection from a client or application activates a compute. Activity on the connection keeps the compute in an `Active` state. A defined period of inactivity (5 minutes by default) places the compute into an `Idle` state.

Factors that affect _active hours_ include:

- The number of active computes
- The size of each compute
- The _Autosuspend_ feature, which suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity by default. Users on paid plans can configure the autosuspend timeout or disable it entirely.
- The _Autoscaling_ feature, which allows you to set a minimum and maximum compute size. Compute size automatically scales up and down between these boundaries based on workload.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon uses a small amount of compute time, included in your billed compute hours, to perform a periodic check to ensure that your computes can start and read and write data. See [Availability Checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker) for more information.
</Admonition>

The compute hours formula is as follows:

```text
compute hours = compute size * active hours
```

### Estimate your compute hour usage

To estimate what your compute hour usage might be per month:

1. Determine the compute size you require, in Compute Units (CUs).
1. Estimate the amount of _active hours_ per month for your compute(s).
1. Input the values into the compute hours formula:

   ```text
   compute hours = compute size * active hours
   ```

   For example, this is a calculation for a 2 vCPU compute that is active for all hours in a month (approx. 730 hours):

   ```text
   2 * 730 = 1460 compute hours
   ```

   This calculation is useful when trying to select the right Neon plan or when estimating the extra compute usage you might need.

   <Admonition type="note">
   If you plan to use Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, estimating **compute hours** is more challenging. Autoscaling adjusts the compute size based on demand within the defined minimum and maximum compute size thresholds. The best approach is to estimate an average compute size and modify the compute hours formula as follows:

   ```text
   compute hours = average compute size * active hours
   ```

   To estimate an average compute size, start with a minimum compute size that can hold your data or working set (see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute)). Pick a maximum compute size that can handle your peak loads. Try estimating an average compute size between those thresholds based on your workload profile for a typical day.

## Projects

In Neon, everything starts with a project. A project is a container for your branches, databases, roles, and other resources and settings. A project also defines the region your data and resources reside in. We typically recommend creating a project for each application or each client. In addition to organizing objects, projects are a way to track storage and compute usage by application or client.

The following table outlines project allowances for each Neon plan.

| Plan       | Projects |
|------------|----------|
| Free Tier  | 1        |
| Launch     | 10       |
| Scale      | 50       |

- When you reach your limit on the [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) or [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) plan, you cannot create additional projects. Instead, you can upgrade to the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) or [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan, which offer allowances of 10 and 50 projects, respectively.
- Extra projects are available with the [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan in increments of 10 for $50 each. If you use more than 50 projects, you are automatically billed for an extra package of 10 projects. For example, if you use 51 projects during the billign period, you are billed for a package of 10 projects for the month($50). If you use 61 projects, you are billed for two packages of 10 projects ($100) for the month, and so on.

# Sample billing

title: Sample project billing
enableTableOfContents: true
subtitle: Practical example of how Neon pricing is calculated
updatedOn: '2024-02-23T21:47:38.905Z'
---

## Generative AI example

To give you a clearer sense of how billing works, let's explore a real-world example. Consider a simple image generation app that leverages Neon as the serverless database for storing user authentication details as well as records of image generation per user. Analyzing this usage over a monthly billing period can help you understand the nuances of Neon billing based on actual scenarios and choose the right pricing plan.

## Overview: Costs by usage

Roughly six months since launch, this high-traffic application attracts about 80K visitors daily, up to 450K weekly. It receives a steady influx of new users, with 3-5 new accounts created every hour. Each user's activity is capped at 5 images per month. This pattern of interaction and account creation gives you a sense of the steady volume of activity hitting the database. 

## Assumptions

### Tech stack (user management portion of the app):
* **Authentication**: [NextAuth.JS](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication with OAuth
* **Database**: Neon Serverless Postgres to store user info and session detail
* **ORM**: [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) for database interactions
* **Deployment Region**: US East (Ohio)

### Userbase:
* **Daily Active Users.** 80,000 users/day, implying a consistent volume of read queries. With a global, consumer-oriented user base, traffic is evenly distributed with no distinct peaks or dormant periods.
* **Account creation.** Average of 3-5 sign-ups per hour, totaling 120 new accounts per day. This gives you an idea of the number of write operations to the database for user authentication.
* **User activity.** Each user's usage is capped at 5 generations per month. This includes logging IDs of generated photos and the incremental number of generations, which are written to the relevant tables.

<Admonition type="note">
Given the high number of connections used by this application, [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) is essential.
</Admonition>

### Compute hours and storage:

* **Compute hours.** This metric refers to the size of the CPU required to handle your interactions plus the length of time your compute is active (compute hours = compute size * active hours). The average daily compute usage is 23.94 hours, totaling 718.35 hours for the sample month. This indicates steady but low-intensity database usage.
* **Storage.** The amount of database storage currently used by your project. It includes the total volume of data across all branches plus the shared history. The database is now over 25 GiB and growing steadily with new written data as the user base grows.

## Consumption breakdown for the month

These graphs show the usage and costs incurred for the month.

### Compute

Compute usage is steady at almost 24 compute hours per day across the month.

![Sample billing graph](/docs/introduction/billing_compute_graph.png)

Daily average of 23.94 compute hours leads to a total of 713.35 compute hours for the month.

### Storage

Project storage grew 4.4 GiB over the month, from 23.6 GiB to 28 GiB.

![Sample storage graph](/docs/introduction/billing_storage_graph.png)

### Table view

Here are the daily averages and monthly totals for the 2 key usage metrics that Neon uses to calculate how much you are consuming within your selected plan.

| Metric          | Daily Average | Monthly Total |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Compute hours    | 23.94 compute hours      | 718.35 compute hours    |

 Metric           | Start of billing period| End of billing period |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Storage         | 23.6 GiB        | 28 GiB      |

### Which Neon pricing plan fits best?

At roughly 718 compute hours for the month with a compute size of 0.25 vCPU, this application is well under the 1,200 active hours/month allowance for the [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans##launch) plan and 3000 active hours/month allowance for the [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan. However, with a storage size of 25 GiB, the storage requirements for the application are over the Launch plan allowance of 10 GiB. You could go with the Launch plan which offers 10 GiB of storage plus extra storage at $3.5 per 2 GiB unit or the Scale plan which offers 50 GiB storage. Let's do that math to compare monthly bills:

**Launch plan**:

- Base fee: $19
- Storage usage: 25 GiB (15 GiB over the allowance)
- Compute usage: 718 hours (within the 1200 hour allowance)
- Extra storage fee: 8 * $3.5 = $28
- Extra compute fee: $0

_Total estimate_: $19 + $28 = $47 per month

**Scale plan**:

- Base fee: $69
- Storage usage: 25 GiB (within the 50 GiB allowance)
- Compute usage: 718 hours (within the 3000 allowance)
- Extra storage fee: $0
- Extra compute fee: $0

_Total estimate_: $69 per month

The Launch plan is more economical in the short term, but you should consider upgrading to the [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan when purchasing extra storage on the Launch plan is no longer cheaper than the $69 per month Scale plan. The Scale plan has a higher monthly storage allowance (50 GiB) and a cheaper per-unit extra storage cost (10 GiB at $15 vs. 2 GiB at $3.5). The Scale plan also offers additional features and more projects, which may factor into your decision about when to upgrade.

## Overview

To find out what's going on with your Neon projects and databases, Neon offers several ways to visualize your usage and track your metrics:
- [Project dashboard](#dashboard) &#8212; Find widgets that display the most recent usage metrics across your project
- [Autoscaling graphs](#autoscaling-graphs) &#8212; a visualization of recent vCPU and RAM usage to help understand your sizing needs.
- [Branch-specific metrics](#branch-specific-metrics) &#8212; View key metrics for all branches in your project on the **Branches** page.
- [API metrics](#api-metrics) &#8212; Use the [Neon API](link) to gather a variety of usage metrics for your project.
- [neon_utils](#the-neon_utils-extension) &#8212; A custom Postgres extension that helps you monitor how autoscaling allocates vCPU in response to workload.
- [Other Postgres options](#other-postgres-options) &#8212; Other extensions and tools like [pg_stat_statements](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements) and [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) can provide details about SQL execution counts, totals, average execution time, and other insights into how your database is being used.

## Dashboard

When you open a project in the Neon console, the Dashboard gives you a snapshot view of the most recent usage metrics for that project:

- **Branches** widget &#8212; Shows how much storage your main branch has currently used. It also lists a subset of other branches.
- **Usage since...** widget  &#8212; Shows a snapshot of your current consumption metrics since your last billing date (the last day of the previous month).
- **Project settings** widget &#8212; Shows current project settings like your compute size default and history retention window.
- **Operations** widget &#8212; Lists a subset of the most recent [Neon operations](/docs/manage/operations) like `create_branch`, `start_compute`, and `suspend_compute`. If there are any critical issues or events, you should see these show up here.

In any of these widgets, you can click the link in the top right corner to get more detail, a wider view, and take various actions.

## Autoscaling graphs

For Pro users, when you edit your compute from the **Branches** page, there is a graph showing your recent vCPU and RAM usage. This can help visualize whether your current minimum and maximum sizes are suitable for your current level of demand.

See [Monitoring Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide#monitoring-autoscaling) for details.

## Branch-specific metrics

The **Branches** page provides key usage metrics for all your branches, like active hours, compute hours, storage space used, and whether the branch includes a read-write compute, all organized into a table view that lets you scan your list of branches. You can also use search if your list of branches is quite long.

## API metrics

Using the Neon API, you can collect a variety of usage-based consumption metrics like  `data_storage_bytes_hour` and `compute_time_seconds`.

Use this `GET` request to get details from an individual project.

```curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/[project_ID] \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

For more details, see [Retrieving details about a project](/docs/guides/partner-billing#retrieving-details-about-a-project).

## The neon_utils extension

The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how Neon's Autoscaling feature allocates vCPU in response to workload. The function returns the current number of allocated vCPUs.

For full details, see [neon_utils](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).

## Other Postgres options

Neon recommends a few tools from the Postgres community that can help you understand what is happening within your database:

- [pg_stat_activity](#pg_stat_activity)
- [pg_stat_statements](#pg_stat_statements)
- [PgHero](#PgHero)

### pg_stat_activity

This system view built into Postgres provides real-time information on current database connections and queries being executed. A helpful for determining who is accessing your database.

Try this query out in the Neon Console:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

You should see a range of information about what's currently happening in the selected database. For details, see [pg_stat_activity](https://neon.tech/docs/postgres/monitoring-stats#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW).

### pg_stat_statements

A Postgres extension that tracks information such as execution counts, total and average execution times, latency, and so on, which can help you analyze and optimize SQL query performance.

Here are some typical queries that you might find helpful:

- [Monitor slow queries](/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements#monitor-slow-queries)
- [Find the most frequently executed queries](/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements#monitor-slow-queries)
- [Find the most time-consuming queries](/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements#monitor-slow-queries)

For more information, see our [pg_stat_statements](/docs/extensions/pg_stat_statements) documentation page.

<Admonition type="note">
Currently, not all information within `pg_stats_statements` persists when a compute instance is autosuspended (scales-to-zero) due to inactivity. For example, the text of your queries may not survive the restart. Our teams are looking into making all `pg_stat_statements` data persistent across compute restarts.
</Admonition>

### PgHero

[PgHero](https://github.com/pghero/pghero) is an open-source performance tool for Postgres that can help you find and fix data issues, using a dashboard interface.

## Feedback and future improvements

At Neon, we understand that observability and monitoring are critical for running successful applications.

Check out our [roadmap](/docs/introduction/roadmap) to see what's coming next. And if you've got feature requests or feedback about what you'd like to see in Neon observability features, let us know via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or in our [feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/1176467419317940276/1176788564890112042) on Discord.

The Neon SQL Editor allows you to run queries on your Neon databases directly from the Neon Console. In addition, the editor keeps a query history, permits saving queries, and provides [**Explain**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) and [**Analyze**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-ANALYZE) features.

<a id="query-via-ui/"></a>

To use the SQL Editor:

1. Navigate to the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/).
2. Select your project.
3. Select **SQL Editor**.
4. Select a branch and database.
5. Enter a query into the editor and click **Run** to view the results.

![Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/sql_editor.png)

You can use the following query to try the SQL Editor. The query creates a table, adds data, and retrieves the data from the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE playing_with_neon(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, value REAL);
INSERT INTO playing_with_neon(name, value)
SELECT LEFT(md5(i::TEXT), 10), random() FROM generate_series(1, 10) s(i);
SELECT * FROM playing_with_neon;
```

Running multiple query statements at once returns a separate result set for each statement. The result sets are displayed in separate tabs, numbered in order of execution, as shown above.

To clear the editor, click **New Query**.

<Admonition type="tip">
When querying objects such as tables and columns with upper case letters in their name, remember to enclose the identifier name in quotes. For example: `SELECT * FROM "Company"`. Postgres changes identifier names to lower case unless they are quoted. The same applies when creating objects in Postgres. For example, `CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(id INT)` creates a table named `department` in Postgres. For more information about how quoted and unquoted identifiers are treated by Postgres, see [Identifiers and Key Words](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.
</Admonition>

## Save your queries

The SQL Editor allows you to save your queries.

To save a query:

1. Enter the query into the editor.
2. Click **Save** to open the **SAVE QUERY** dialog.
3. Enter a name for the query and click **Save**.

The query is added to the **Saved** list in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can rerun a query by selecting it from the **Saved** list.

You can rename or delete a saved query by selecting **Rename** or **Delete** from the kebab menu associated with the saved query.

## View the query history

The SQL Editor maintains a query history for the project. To view your query history, select **History** in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can click an item in the **History** list to view the query that was run.

## Explain and Analyze

The Neon SQL Editor provides **Explain** and **Analyze** features.

- The **Explain** feature runs the specified query with the Postgres [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) command, which returns the execution plan for the query. The **Explain** feature only returns a plan with estimates. It does not execute the query.
- The **Analyze** feature runs the specified query with [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-ANALYZE). The `ANALYZE` parameter causes the query to be executed and returns actual row counts and run times for plan nodes along with the `EXPLAIN` estimates.

Understanding the information provided by the **Explain** and **Analyze** features requires familiarity with the Postgres [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) command and its `ANALYZE` parameter. Refer to the [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) documentation and the [Using EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html) topic in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.

When connecting to Neon from an application or client, you connect to a database in your Neon project. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which may be the primary branch of your project (`main`) or a child branch.

You can obtain the database connection details you require from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a compute, a database, and a role. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#connection-pooling).

A Neon connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^    ^         ^                                               ^
     role -|    |         |- hostname                                     |- database
                |
                |- password
```

<Admonition type="note">
The hostname includes the ID of the compute endpoint, which has an `ep-` prefix: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`. For more information about Neon connection strings, see [Connection string](/docs/reference/glossary#connection-string).
</Admonition>

You can use the details from the connection string or the connection string itself to configure a connection. For example, you might place the connection details in an `.env` file, assign the connection string to a variable, or pass the connection string on the command-line.

`.env` file:

```text
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
```

Variable:

```text shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Command-line:

```bash shouldWrap
psql postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection by appending an `sslmode` parameter setting to your connection string. For instructions, see [Connect to Neon securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).
</Admonition>

## Where do I obtain a password?

It's included in your Neon connection string, which you can find on the Neon **Dashboard**, in the **Connection Details** widget.

## What port does Neon use?

Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.

## Connection examples

The **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard** also provides connection examples for different programming languages and application frameworks, constructed for the branch, database, and role that you select.

![Language and framework connection examples](/docs/connect/code_connection_examples.png)

See our [Framework, language, and platform guides](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/guides-intro) for more connection examples.

## Network protocol support

Neon supports both [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4) and [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) addresses.

Additionally, Neon provides a serverless driver that supports both WebSocket and HTTP connections. For further information, refer to our [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) documentation.

## Connection notes

- Some older client libraries and drivers, including older `psql` executables, are built without [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/docs/reference/glossary#sni) support and require a workaround. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).
- Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For examples, see [Connect a GUI or IDE](/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#connect-to-the-database).

This topic describes how to connect to a Neon database from a GUI application or IDE. Most GUI applications and IDEs that support connecting to a Postgres database also support connecting to Neon.

## Gather your connection details

The following details are typically required when configuring a connection:

- hostname
- port
- database name
- role (user)
- password

You can gather these details from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

<Admonition type="note">
Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#connection-pooling).
</Admonition>

The connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- <role>      |- <hostname>                                   |- <database>
```

- role name: `alex`
- hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- database name: `dbname`

Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.

## Connect to the database

In the GUI application or IDE, enter the connection details into the appropriate fields and connect. Some applications permit specifying a connection string while others require entering connection details into separate fields. In the pgAdmin example below, connection details are entered into separate fields, and clicking **Save** establishes the database connection.

![Register - Server](/docs/connect/pgadmin4.png)

Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For example, the DBeaver client has a **URL** field, but connecting to Neon requires specifying the connection details as shown:

![DBeaver connection](/docs/connect/dbeaver_connection.png)

## Tested GUI applications and IDEs

Connections from the GUI applications and IDEs in the table below have been tested with Neon.

<Admonition type="note">
Some applications require an Server Name Indication (SNI) workaround. Neon uses compute endpoint domain names to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer the server domain name, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this. Not all application clients support SNI. In these cases, a workaround is required. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).

Neon's `psql` passwordless auth feature helps you quickly authenticate a connection to Neon without providing a password.

The following instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), an interactive terminal for working with Postgres. For information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

To connect using Neon's `psql` passwordless auth feature:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   psql -h pg.neon.tech
   ```

   A response similar to the following is displayed:

   ```bash
   NOTICE:  Welcome to Neon!
   Authenticate by visiting:
       https://console.neon.tech/psql_session/6d32af5ef8215b62
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to the provided link. Log in to Neon if you are not already logged in. You are asked to select a Neon project to connect to. If your project has more than one compute endpoint, you are also asked to select one.

   After making your selections, you are advised that you can return to your terminal or command window where information similar to the following is displayed:

   ```bash
   NOTICE:  Connecting to database.
   psql (15.0 (Ubuntu 15.0-1.pgdg22.04+1))
   Type "help" for help.

   casey=>
   ```

   The passwordless auth feature connects to the first database created in the branch. To check the database you are connected to, issue this query:

   ```sql
   SELECT current_database();
    current_database
   ------------------
    neondb
    ```

    Switching databases from the `psql` prompt (using `\c <database_name>`, for example) after you have authenticated restarts the passwordless auth authentication process to authenticate a connection to the new database.

## Running queries

After establishing a connection, try running the following queries:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT now();
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

The following result set is returned:

```sql
SELECT 1
              now
-------------------------------

The following instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres and running ad-hoc queries. For more information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

<Admonition type="note">
A Neon compute instance runs Postgres, which means that any Postgres application or standard utility such as `psql` is compatible with Neon. You can also use Postgres client libraries and drivers to connect. However, please be aware that some older client libraries and drivers, including older `psql` executables, are built without [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/docs/reference/glossary#sni) support and require a workaround. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).

Neon also provides a passwordless auth feature that uses `psql`. For more information, see [Passwordless auth](/docs/connect/passwordless-connect).
</Admonition>

The easiest way to connect to Neon using `psql` is with a connection string.

You can obtain a connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

From your terminal or command prompt, run the `psql` client with the connection string copied from the Neon **Dashboard**.

```bash shouldWrap

Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties. Neon rejects connections that do not use SSL/TLS, behaving in the same way as standalone Postgres with only `hostssl` records in a `pg_hba.conf` configuration file.

However, there are different levels of protection when using SSL/TLS encryption, which you can configure by appending an `sslmode` parameter to your connection string.

## Connection modes

When connecting to Neon or any Postgres database, the `sslmode` parameter setting determines the security of the connection. You can append the `sslmode` parameter to your Neon connection string as shown:

```text shouldWrap
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=verify-full
```

Neon supports the following `sslmode` settings, in order of least to most secure.

| sslmode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `require` | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. If verification fails, the connection is refused. |
| `verify-ca` | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). |
| `verify-full` | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is fully verified, including hostname verification, expiration checks, and revocation checks. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). |

The choice of which mode to use depends on the specific security requirements of the application and the level of risk that you are willing to tolerate. Neon recommends that you always use `verify-full` mode, which ensures the highest level of security and protects against a wide range of attacks including man-in-the-middle attacks. The following sections describe how to configure connections using `verify-full` mode.

The required configuration for your connection depends on the client you are using.

## Connect from the psql client

To connect from the `psql` command-line client with `sslmode=verify-full`, provide the path to your system root certificates by setting the `PGSSLROOTCERT` variable to the location of your operating system's root certificates. You can set this environment variable in your shell, typically bash or similar, using the export command. For example, if your root certificate is at `/path/to/root.crt`, you would set the variable like so:

```bash
export PGSSLROOTCERT="/path/to/your/root.crt"
```

Refer to [Location of system root certificates](#location-of-system-root-certificates) below to find the path to system root certificates for your operating system.

## Connect from other clients

If the client application uses a popular Postgres client library, such as `psycopg2` for Python or JDBC for Java, the library typically provides built-in support for SSL/TLS encryption and verification, allowing you to configure an `sslmode` setting in the connection parameters. For example:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname='dbname',
    user='alex',
    password='AbC123dEf',
    host='ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech',
    port='5432',
    sslmode='verify-full',
    sslrootcert='/path/to/your/root.crt'
)
```

However, if your client application uses a non-standard Postgres client, SSL/TLS may not be enabled by default. In this case, you must manually configure the client to use SSL/TLS and specify an `sslmode` configuration. Refer to the client or the client's driver documentation for how to configure the path to your operating system's root certificates.

### Location of system root certificates

Neon uses public root certificates issued by [Letâs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). These certificates are usually available in a root store on your operating system. A root store is a collection of pre-downloaded root certificates from various Certificate Authorities (CAs). These are highly trusted CAs, and their certificates are typically shipped with operating systems and some applications.

The location of the root store varies by operating system or distribution. Here are some locations where you might find the required root certificates on popular operating systems:

- Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc.

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ```

- CentOS, Fedora, RedHat

  ```bash
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
  ```

- OpenSUSE

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
  ```
  
- Alpine Linux

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  ```

- Android

  ```bash
  /system/etc/security/cacerts
  ```

- macOS:

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  ```

- Windows

  Windows does not provide a file containing the CA roots that can be used by your driver. However, many popular programming languages used on Windows like C#, Java, or Go do not require the CA root path to be specified and will use the Windows internal system roots by default.

  However, if you are using a language that requires specifying the CA root path, such as C or PHP, you can obtain a bundle of root certificates from the Mozilla CA Certificate program provided by the Curl project. You can download the bundle at [https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html). After downloading the file, you will need to configure your driver to point to the bundle.

The system root certificate locations listed above may differ depending on the version, distribution, and configuration of your operating system. If you do not find the root certificates in these locations, refer to your operating system documentation.

Neon uses [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) to offer support for connection pooling, enabling up to 10,000 concurrent connections. PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for Postgres.

This topic describes Neon's default connection limits, how connection pooling works, and how you can enable connection pooling for your applications.

## Default connection limits

Each Postgres connection creates a new process in the operating system, which consumes resources. Postgres limits the number of open connections for this reason. The Postgres connection limit is defined by the `max_connections` parameter.

In Neon, the size of your compute determines the `max_connections` setting. The formula used to calculate `max_connections` is `RAM in bytes / 9531392 bytes`. For a Neon Free Tier compute, which has 1 GB of RAM, this works out to approximately 100 connections. Larger computes offered with paid plans have more RAM and therefore support a larger number of connections. For example, a compute with 12 GB of RAM supports 1351 connections. You can check the `max_connections` limit for your compute by running the following query from the Neon SQL Editor or a client connected to Neon:

```sql
SHOW max_connections;
```

Even with the largest compute size, the `max_connections` limit may not be sufficient for some applications, such as those that use serverless functions. To increase the number of connections that Neon supports, you can use _connection pooling_. All Neon plans, including the [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier), support connection pooling.

## Connection pooling

Some applications open numerous connections, with most eventually becoming inactive. This behavior can often be attributed to database driver limitations, running many instances of an application, or applications with serverless functions. With regular Postgres, new connections are rejected when reaching the `max_connections` limit. To overcome this limitation, Neon supports connection pooling using [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), which allows Neon to support up to 10,000 concurrent connections.

PgBouncer is an open-source connection pooler for Postgres. When an application needs to connect to a database, PgBouncer provides a connection from the pool. Connections in the pool are routed to a smaller number of actual Postgres connections. When a connection is no longer required, it is returned to the pool and is available to be used again. Maintaining a pool of available connections improves performance by reducing the number of connections that need to be created and torn down to service incoming requests. Connection pooling also helps avoid rejected connections. When all connections in the pool are being used, PgBouncer queues a new request until a connection from the pool becomes available.

Neon uses `PgBouncer` in `transaction mode`. For limitations associated with `transaction mode`, see [Connection pooling notes and limitations](#connection-pooling-notes-and-limitations). For more information about `PgBouncer`, refer to [https://www.pgbouncer.org/](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).

## Enable connection pooling

Enabling connection pooling in Neon requires adding a `-pooler` suffix to the compute endpoint ID, which is part of the Neon hostname. Connections that specify the `-pooler` suffix in the connection string use a pooled connection.

You can add the `-pooler` suffix to the endpoint ID in your connection string as shown:

```text shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

The **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** provides **Pooled connection** checkbox that adds the `-pooler` option to a connection string that you can copy and paste.

![Connection Details pooled connection string](/docs/connect/connection_details_pooled.png)

## Optimize queries with PgBouncer and prepared statements

Protocol-level prepared statements are supported with Neon and PgBouncer as of the [PgBouncer 1.22.0 release](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/releases/tag/pgbouncer_1_21_0). Using prepared statements can help boost query performance while providing an added layer of protection against potential SQL injection attacks.

### Understanding prepared statements

A prepared statement in Postgres allows for the optimization of an SQL query by defining its structure once and executing it multiple times with varied parameters. Here's an SQL-level example to illustrate. Note that direct SQL-level `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` are not supported with PgBouncer (see [below](#use-prepared-statements-with-pgbouncer)), so you can't use this query from the SQL editor. It is meant to give you a clear idea of how a prepared statement works. Refer to the protocol-level samples below to see how this SQL-level example translates to different protocol-level examples.

```sql
PREPARE fetch_plan (TEXT) AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1;

EXECUTE fetch_plan('alice');
```

`fetch_plan` here is the prepared statement's name, and `$1` acts as a parameter placeholder.

The benefits of using prepared statements include:

- **Performance**: Parsing the SQL and creating the execution plan happens just once, speeding up subsequent executions. This performance benefit would be most noticeable on databases with heavy and repeated traffic.
- **Security**: By sending data values separately from the query, prepared statements reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.

You can learn more about prepared statements in the PostgreSQL documentation. See [PREPARE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html).

### Use prepared statements with PgBouncer

Since pgBouncer supports protocol-level prepared statements only, you must rely on PostgreSQL client libraries instead (direct SQL-level `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` are not supported). Fortunately, most PostgreSQL client libraries support prepared statements. Here are a couple of examples showing how to use prepared statements with Javascript and Python client libraries:

<CodeTabs labels={["pg", "psycopg2"]}>

```javascript
const query = {
   // give the query a unique name
   name: 'fetch-plan',
      text: 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1',
      values: ['alice'],
  };
  client.query(query);
```

```python
cur = conn.cursor()
  query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s;"
  cur.execute(query, ('alice',), prepare=True)
  results = cur.fetchall()
```

</CodeTabs>

## Neon PgBouncer configuration settings

Neon's PgBouncer configuration is shown below. The settings are not user-configurable.

```ini
[pgbouncer]
pool_mode=transaction
max_client_conn=10000
default_pool_size=64
max_prepared_statements=0
query_wait_timeout=120
```

The following list describes each setting. For a full explanation of each parameter, please refer to the official [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html).

- `pool_mode=transaction`: The pooling mode PgBouncer uses, set to `transaction` pooling.
- `max_client_conn=10000`: Maximum number of client connections allowed.
- `default_pool_size=64`: Default number of server connections to allow per user/database pair.
- `max_prepared_statements=0`: Maximum number of prepared statements a connection is allowed to have at the same time. `0` means prepared statements are disabled.
- `query_wait_timeout=120`: Maximum time queries are allowed to spend waiting for execution. Neon uses the default setting of `120` seconds.

## Connection pooling notes and limitations

Neon uses PgBouncer in _transaction mode_, which limits some functionality in Postgres. For a complete list of limitations, refer to the "_SQL feature map for pooling modes_" section in the [pgbouncer.org Features](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html) documentation.

</Admonition>

## The endpoint ID is not specified

With older clients and some native Postgres clients, you may receive the following error when attempting to connect to Neon:

```txt shouldWrap
ERROR: The endpoint ID is not specified. Either upgrade the Postgres client library (libpq) for SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (the first part of the domain name) as a parameter: '&options=endpoint%3D'. See [https://neon.tech/sni](https://neon.tech/sni) for more information.
```

This error occurs if your client library or application does not support the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** mechanism in TLS.

Neon uses compute endpoint IDs (the first part of a Neon domain name) to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer domain name information, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this.

SNI support was added to the `libpq` (the official Postgres client library) in version 14, which was released in September 2021. Clients that use your system's `libpq` library should work if you `libpq` version is >= 14. On Linux and macOS, you can check your `libpq` version by running `pg_config --version`. On Windows, check the `libpq.dll` version in your Postgres installation's `bin` directory. Right click on the file, select **Properties** > **Details**.  

If a library or application upgrade does not help, there are several workarounds, described below, for providing the required domain name information when connecting to Neon.

### A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option

Neon supports a connection option named `endpoint`, which you can use to identify the compute endpoint you are connecting to. Specifically, you can add `options=endpoint%3D[endpoint_id]` as a parameter to your connection string, as shown in the example below. The `%3D` is a URL-encoded `=` sign. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

```txt shouldWrap
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?options=endpoint%3D[endpoint-id]
```

<Admonition type="note">
The `endpoint` connection option was previously named `project`. The `project` option is deprecated but remains supported for backward compatibility.
</Admonition>

The `endpoint` option works if your application or library permits it to be set. Not all of them do, especially in the case of GUI applications.

### B. Use libpq key=value syntax in the database field

If your application or client is based on `libpq` but you cannot upgrade the library, such as when the library is compiled inside of a an application, you can take advantage of the fact that `libpq` permits adding options to the database name. So, in addition to the database name, you can specify the `endpoint` option, as shown below. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

```txt
dbname=neondb options=endpoint=[endpoint_id]
```

### C. Set verify-full for golang-based clients

If your application or service uses golang Postgres clients like `pgx` and `lib/pg`, you can set `sslmode=verify-full`, which causes SNI information to be sent when you connect. Most likely, this behavior is not intended but happens inadvertently due to the golang's TLS library API design.

### D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field

Another supported workaround involves specifying the endpoint ID in the password field. So, instead of specifying only your password, you provide a string consisting of the `endpoint` option and your password, separated by a semicolon (`;`) or dollar sign character (`$`), as shown in the examples below. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

```txt
endpoint=<endpoint_id>;<password>
```

or

```txt
endpoint=<endpoint_id>$<password>
```

Example: 

```txt
postgres://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456;AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

<Admonition type="note">
Using a dollar sign (`$`) character as a separator may be required if a semicolon (`;`) is not a permitted character in a password field. For example, the [AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) does not permit a semicolon character in the **Password** field when defining connection details for database endpoints.
</Admonition>

This approach causes the authentication method to be downgraded from `scram-sha-256` (never transfers a plain text password) to `password` (transfers a plain text password). However, the connection is still TLS-encrypted, so the level of security is equivalent to the security provided by `https` websites. We intend deprecate this option when most libraries and applications provide SNI support.

### Libraries

Clients on the [list of drivers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/List_of_drivers) on the PostgreSQL community wiki that use your system's `libpq` library should work if your `libpq` version is >= 14.

Neon has tested the following drivers for SNI support:

## Password authentication failed for user

The following error is often the result of an incorrectly defined connection information, or the driver you are using does not support Server Name Indication (SNI).

```text shouldWrap
ERROR:  password authentication failed for user '<user_name>' connection to server at "ep-billowing-fun-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech" (12.345.67.89), port 5432 failed: ERROR:  connection is insecure (try using `sslmode=require`)
```

Check your connection to see if it is defined correctly. Your Neon connection string can be obtained from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. It appears similar to this:

```text shouldWrap
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

For clients or applications that require specifying connection parameters such as user, password, and hostname separately, the values in a Neon connection string correspond to the following:

- **User**: `daniel`
- **Password**: `f74wh99w398H`
- **Hostname**: `ep-white-morning-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- **Port number**: `5432` (Neon uses default Postgres port, `5432`, and is therefore not included in the connection string)
- **Database name**: `neondb` (`neondb` is the ready-to-use database created with each Neon project. Your database name may differ.)

If you find that your connection string is defined correctly, see the instructions regarding SNI support outlined in the preceding section: [The endpoint ID is not specified](#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified).

## Couldn't connect to compute node

This error arises when the Neon proxy, which accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol, fails to establish a connection with your compute. This issue sometimes occurs due to repeated connection attempts during the compute's restart phase after it has been idle due to [Autosuspend](/docs/reference/glossary#autosuspend-compute) (scale to zero). Currently, the transition from an idle state to an active one takes a few seconds.

Consider these recommended steps:

- Visit the [Neon status page](https://neonstatus.com/) to ensure there are no ongoing issues.
- Pause for a short period to allow your compute to restart, then try reconnecting.
- Try [connecting with psql](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) to see if a connection can be established.
- Review the strategies in [Connection latency and timeouts](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-latency) for avoiding connection issues due to compute startup time.

If the connection issue persists, please reach out to [Support](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/support).

## Can't reach database server

This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Client with Neon.

```text shouldWrap
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
```

A compute node in Neon has two main states: **Active** and **Idle**. Active means that Postgres is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, the activity monitor gracefully places the compute node into an idle state to save energy and resources.

When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds. If the error above is reported, it most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before your Neon compute was activated. For dealing with this connection timeout scenario, refer to the [connection timeout](/docs/guides/prisma#connection-timeouts) instructions in our Prisma documentation. Our [connection latency and timeout](/docs/connect/connection-latency) documentation may also be useful in addressing this issue.

## Error undefined: Database error

This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Migrate with Neon.

```text
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
```

Prisma Migrate requires a direct connection to the database. It does not support a pooled connection with PgBouncer, which is the connection pooler used by Neon. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as `prisma migrate dev`, with a pooled connection causes this error. To resolve this issue, please refer to our [Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate](/docs/guides/prisma#connect-pooling-with-prisma-migrate) instructions.

## Terminating connection due to administrator command

The `terminating connection due to administrator command` error is typically encountered when running a query from a connection that has sat idle long enough for the compute endpoint to suspend due to inactivity. Neon automatically suspends a compute endpoint after 5 minutes of inactivity, by default. You can reproduce this error by connecting to your database from an application or client such as `psql`, letting the connection remain idle until the compute suspends, and then running a query from the same connection.

If you encounter this error, you can try adjusting the timing of your query or reestablishing the connection before running the query. Alternatively, if you are a paying user, you can disable autosuspend or configure a different suspension period. For instructions, see [Configuring Autosuspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).  [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users cannot modify the default 5 minute autosuspend setting.

## Unsupported startup parameter

This error is reported in two variations:

```text
unsupported startup parameter: <...>
```

```text
unsupported startup parameter in options: <...>
```

The error occurs when using a pooled Neon connection string with startup options that are not supported by PgBouncer. PgBouncer allows only startup parameters it can keep track of in startup packets. These include: `client_encoding`, `datestyle`, `timezone`, `standard_conforming_strings`, and `application_name`. See **track_extra_parameters**, in the [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#track_extra_parameters). To resolve this error, you can either remove the unsupported parameter from your connection string or use an unpooled Neon connection string. For information about pooled and unpooled connections in Neon, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

# Latency and timeouts

Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature ('scale to zero') is designed to minimize costs by automatically scaling a compute resource down to zero after a period of inactivity. By default, Neon scales a compute to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity. A characteristic of this feature is the concept of a "cold start". During this process, a compute instance transitions from an idle state to an active state to process requests. Currently, activating a Neon compute from an idle state takes anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds not counting other factors that can add to latencies such as the physical distance between your application and database or startup times of other services that participate in your connection process.

Cold-start times are fastest in the `US East (Ohio) â aws-us-east-2` region, which hosts the Neon Control Plane. The Neon Control plane will be deployed regionally in future Neon releases, bringing the same millesecond cold-start times to all supported regions.

<Admonition type="note">
Services you integrate with Neon may also have startup times, which can add to connection latencies. This topic does not address latencies of other vendors, but if your application connects to Neon via another service, remember to consider startup times for those services as well.
</Admonition>

## Check the status of a compute

You can check the current status of a compute on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute will report either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

![Compute endpoint status](/docs/connect/compute_endpoint_state.png)

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="info">
The Neon API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
</Admonition>

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it changes from an **Idle** to an **Active** state. By default, a compute is suspended after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. Users on paid plans can configure this delay period, which is described later in this topic.

## Strategies for managing latency and timeouts

Given the potential impact on application responsiveness, it's important to have strategies in place for managing connection latencies and timeouts. Here are some methods you can implement:

- [Adjust your Autosuspend (scale to zero) configuration](#adjust-your-auto-suspend-scale-to-zero-configuration)
- [Place your application and database in the same region](#place-your-application-and-database-in-the-same-region)
- [Increase your connection timeout](#increase-your-connection-timeout)
- [Build connection timeout handling into your application](#build-connection-timeout-handling-into-your-application)
- [Use application-level caching](#use-application-level-caching)

### Adjust your Autosuspend (scale to zero) configuration

Users on paid plans can configure the length of time that the system remains in an inactive state before Neon scales your compute down to zero. This lets you set the balance between performance (never scaling down) and cost (scaling to zero at reasonable intervals). The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting is set to 5 minutes by default. You can disable autosuspend entirely or set a custom period up to a maximum of 7 days. Limiting or disabling autosuspend can eliminate or reduce startup times, but it also increases compute usage. For configuration instructions, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

Consider combining this strategy with Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, which allows you to run a compute with minimal resources and scale up on demand. For example, with autoscaling, you can configure a minimum compute size to reduce costs during off-peak times. In the image shown below, the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** is set to 1 hour so that your compute only suspends after an hour of inactivity, and autoscaling is configured with the 1/4 minimum compute size to keep costs low during periods of inactivity or light usage.

![Connection warmup autosuspend and autoscaling configuration](/docs/connect/cold_start_compute_config.png)

For autoscaling configuration instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

### Place your application and database in the same region

A key strategy for reducing connection latency is ensuring that your application and database are hosted in the same region, or as close as possible, geographically. For the regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions). For information about moving your database to a different region, see [Import data from another Neon project](/docs/import/import-from-neon).

### Increase your connection timeout

By configuring longer connection timeout durations, your application has more time to accommodate cold starts and other factors that contribute to latency.

Connection timeout settings are typically configured in your application or the database client library you're using, and the specific way to do it depends on the language or framework you're using.

Here are examples of how to increase connection timeout settings in a few common programming languages and frameworks:

<CodeTabs labels={["Node.js", "Python", "Java", "Prisma" ]}>

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg')

const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000, // connection timeout in milliseconds
    idleTimeoutMillis: 10000 // idle timeout in milliseconds
})
```

```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import connect
from psycopg2.extensions import ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT
import os

DATABASE_URL = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL, connect_timeout=10)
```

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.util.Properties;

String dbUrl = System.getenv("DATABASE_URL");
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty("connectTimeout", "10");

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, properties);
```

```prisma
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?connect_timeout=15&pool_timeout=15`
```

</CodeTabs>

<Admonition type="note">
If you are using Prisma Client, your timeout issue could be related to Prisma's connection pool configuration. The Prisma Client query engine instantiates its own connection pool when it opens a first connection to the database. If you encounter a `Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool` error, refer to [Prisma connection pool timeouts](/docs/guides/prisma#connection-pool-timeouts) for information about configuring your Prisma connection pool size and pool timeout settings.
</Admonition>

Remember that increasing connection timeout settings might impact the responsiveness of your application, and users could end up waiting longer for their requests to be processed. Always test and monitor your application's performance when making changes like these.

### Build connection timeout handling into your application

You can prepare your application to handle connection timeouts when latency is unavoidable. This might involve using retries with exponential backoff. This Javascript example connects to the database using the `pg` library and uses the `node-retry` library to handle connection retries with an exponential backoff. The general logic can be easily translated into other languages.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
var Client = require('pg').Client;
var retry = require('retry');

// Connection string from .env file
var connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

function connectWithRetry() {
  var operation = retry.operation({
    retries: 5,               // number of retries before giving up
    minTimeout: 4000,         // minimum time between retries in milliseconds
    randomize: true,          // adds randomness to timeouts to prevent retries from overwhelming the server
  });

  operation.attempt(function (currentAttempt) {
    var client = new Client({ connectionString });

    client.connect()
      .then(function() {
        console.log('Connected to the database');
        
        // Perform your operations with the client
        // For example, let's run a simple SELECT query
        return client.query('SELECT NOW()');
      })
      .then(function(res) {
        console.log(res.rows[0]);
        
        return client.end();
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        if (operation.retry(err)) {
          console.warn(`Failed to connect on attempt ${currentAttempt}, retrying...`);
        } else {
          console.error('Failed to connect to the database after multiple attempts:', err);
        }
      });
  });
}

// Usage
connectWithRetry();
```

In the example above, the `operation.attempt` function initiates the connection logic. If the connection fails (i.e., `client.connect()` returns a rejected Promise), the error is passed to `operation.retry`(err). If there are retries left, the retry function schedules another attempt with a delay based on the parameters defined in the `retry.operation`. The delay between retries is controlled by the `minTimeout` and `randomize` options.

The randomize option adds a degree of randomness to the delay to prevent a large number of retries from potentially overwhelming the server. The `minTimeout` option defines the minimum time between retries in milliseconds.

However, this example is a simplification. In a production application, you might want to use a more sophisticated strategy. For example, you could initially attempt to reconnect quickly in the event of a transient network issue, then fall back to slower retries if the problem persists.

### Use application-level caching

Implement a caching system like [Redis](https://redis.io/) or [PolyScale](https://www.polyscale.ai/) to store frequently accessed data, which can be rapidly served to users. This approach can help reduce occurrences of latency, but only if the data requested is available in the cache. Challenges with this strategy include cache invalidation due to frequently changing data, and cache misses when queries request uncached data. This strategy will not avoid latency entirely, but you may be able to combine it with other strategies to improve application responsiveness overall.

## Conclusion

With the right strategies, you can optimize your system to handle connection latencies and timeouts, ensuring your application delivers a consistently high level of performance. The best solution often involves a combination of strategies, so experiment and find the right configuration for your specific use case.

title: Overview of the Neon object hierarchy
enableTableOfContents: true
isDraft: false
updatedOn: '2024-01-31T12:01:56.610Z'
---

Managing your Neon project requires an understanding of the Neon object hierarchy. The following diagram shows how objects in Neon are related. See below for a description of each object.

![Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/neon_object_hierarchy.jpg)

## Neon account

This is the account you used to sign up with Neon. Neon supports signing up with an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account.

## API keys

API keys are global and belong to the Neon account. API keys are used with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to create and manage Neon projects or objects within a Neon project. A Neon account can create unlimited API keys. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## Projects

A project is the top-level object in the Neon object hierarchy. It is a container for all objects except for API keys, which are global and work with any project owned by your Neon account. Branches, compute endpoints, roles, and databases belong to a project. A Neon project also defines the region where project resources reside. A Neon account can have multiple projects, but tier limits define the number of projects per Neon account. For more information, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).

## Primary branch

Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a primary branch called `main`. This initial branch is also your project's root branch, which cannot be deleted. After creating more branches, you can designate a different branch as your primary branch, but your root branch cannot be deleted. You can create child branches from any branch in your project. Each branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Tier limits define the number of branches you can create in a project and the amount of data per branch. To learn more, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).

## Compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is a compute resource associated with a branch. A read-write compute endpoint is created for a project's primary branch by default. Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints. To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint that is associated with the branch. Tier limits define the resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. For more information, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints). Compute size, autoscaling, and autosuspend (scale-to-zero) are all settings that are configured for a compute endpoint. 

## Roles

In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. A role is required to create and access a database. A role belongs to a branch. There is no limit on the number of roles you can create. The primary branch of a Neon project is created with a role named for the account that you registered with. For example, if you registered with a Google account for "Casey Smith", Neon creates a role named "Casey" in the primary branch. If you registered with an email account like `alex@domain.com`, Neon creates a role named "alex". This role is the owner of the ready-to-use `neondb` database in your project's primary branch. Any role created via the Neon Console, CLI, or API is created with [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) privileges. For more information, see [Manage roles](/docs/manage/roles).

## Databases

As with any standalone instance of Postgres, a database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch. The primary branch of a Neon project is created with a ready-to-use database named `neondb`. There is no defined limit on the number of databases you can create in a Neon project. For more information, see [Manage databases](/docs/manage/databases).

Most actions performed in the Neon Console can be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Using the Neon API requires an API key. This topic describes how to generate, revoke, and use API keys.

API keys are global and belong to your Neon account. They can be used with any project that belongs to your Neon account. A Neon account can create unlimited API keys.

## Create an API key

An API key (or token) is a randomly-generated 64-bit key that you must provide when calling Neon API methods. An API key remains valid until it is revoked.

To generate an API key:

1. Log in to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Click your account in the bottom left corner of the Neon Console, and select **Profile**.
3. Select **Developer Settings** and click **Generate new API Key**.
4. Enter a name for the API key.
5. Click **Create** and copy the generated key.

Store your key in a safe location. You will not be able to view or copy the key again after leaving the **Developer Settings** page. You can safely store an API key in a locally installed credential manager or in a credential management service such as the [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). If you lose an API key, revoke it and generate a new one.

## Revoke an API key

An API key that is no longer needed can be revoked. This action cannot be reversed.

To revoke an API key:

1. Click your account in the bottom left corner of the Neon Console and select **Profile**.
2. Select **Developer Settings** to see a list of API keys.
3. To revoke a key, click **Revoke**. The key is immediately revoked. Any request that uses the key now fails.

## Make an API call

The following `cURL` example uses the `/projects` endpoint to retrieve projects that belong to your Neon account.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

where:

- `"https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects"` is the resource URL, which includes the base URL for the Neon API and the `/projects` endpoint.
- The `"Accept: application/json"` in the header specifies the accepted response type.
- The `Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY` entry in the header specifies your API key. Replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual 64-bit API key. A request without this header, or containing an invalid or revoked API key, fails and returns a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code.
- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read.

<details>
<summary>Response body</summary>

```json
{
  "projects": [

    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) for other supported Neon API methods.

## Manage API keys with the Neon API

API key actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and revoke API keys using the Neon API.

### Prerequisites

You can create and manage API keys using the Neon API, but you need an API key to start with. You can obtain an API key from the Neon Console. For instructions, see [Create an API key](#create-an-api-key). In the examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Create an API key with the API

The following Neon API method creates an API key. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createapikey).

```http
POST /api_keys 
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. You must specify the `key_name` attribute and a name for the API key.

```bash
curl https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/api_keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"key_name": "mynewkey"}' | jq
```

The response body includes an `id` for the key and a generated 64-bit `key` value, which can be used to access the Neon API. API keys should stored and managed securely, as they provide access to all objects in your Neon account.

With Neon, everything starts with the project. It is the top-level object in the [Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview). A project can hold as many databases and branches as your application or workflow needs. However, [tier limits](/docs/introduction/plans) define how many projects you can create. The Neon Free Tier limits you to one project per Neon account.

Learn more about projects and how to manage them in these sections:

- [Default resources](#default-resources)
- [Project Settings](#about-the-settings-page)
- [Basic actions](#basic-actions)
- [Advanced settings](#advanced-settings)
- [Manage projects from the API](#manage-projects-with-the-neon-api)

## Default resources

When you add a new project, Neon creates the following resources by default:

- A primary branch called `main`. You can create child branches from the primary branch or from any previously created branch. For more information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).
- A single read-write compute endpoint. This is the compute instance associated with the branch. For more information, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints).
- A ready-to-use database, called `neondb`, which lives in the project's primary branch.
- A default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the email, Google, GitHub, or partner account that you registered with).

## About the Settings page

Once you open a project, you can use the **Project settings** page to manage that particular project and configure any defaults.

![Project Settings page](/docs/manage/settings_page.png)

You can tab between these sections:

- **General** &#8212; Change the name of your project or copy the project ID.
- **Compute** &#8212; Set the autosuspend and sizing defaults for any new compute instances you create when branching.
- **Storage** &#8212; Choose how long Neon maintains a history of changes for all branches.
- **Sharing** &#8212; Let other users access your project's databases.
- **Delete** &#8212; Use with care! This action deletes your entire project and all its objects, and is irreversible.

## Basic actions

Here are some basic actions you can take to add or manage projects:

- [Create a project](#create-a-project)
- [View projects](#view-projects)
- [Change a project name](#change-the-name-or-copy-the-id-of-your-project)
- [Delete a project](#delete-a-project)
- [Share a project](#share-a-project)

### Create a project

The following instructions describe how to create additional Neon projects. If you are creating your very first Neon project, refer to the instructions in [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up). Neon Free Tier users are limited to a single Neon project. Support for multiple projects is only available to users on paid plans.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify values for **Name**, **Postgres version**, and **Region**. Project names are limited to 64 characters. If you are a paying user, you can specify **Compute size** settings when creating a project. The settings you specify become the default settings for compute endpoints that you add to your project when creating [branches](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch) or [read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide).

    - Neon supports fixed size computes and autoscaling. For more information, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
    - The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Autosuspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
  
4. Click **Create Project**.

After creating a project, you are presented with a dialog that provides your connection details for a ready-to-use `neondb` database. The connection details include your password.

### View projects

To view your projects:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select **Home** or the Neon logo at the top left of the Console.
1. The **Projects** page lists your projects, including any projects that have been shared with you.

### Change the name or copy the ID of your project

You are permitted to change the name of your project at any point. The project ID is permanent.

To edit a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to edit.
3. Select **Project settings**.
4. Select **General**.
5. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Delete a project

Deleting a project is a permanent action, which also deletes any compute endpoints, branches, databases, and roles that belong to the project.

To delete a project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to delete.
3. Select **Project settings**.
4. Select **Delete**.
5. Click **Delete project.**
6. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

### Share a project

Neon's project sharing feature allows you to share your project with other Neon accounts.

To share a project:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Sharing**.
1. Under **Grant access to your project**, enter the email address of the account you want to share access with.
1. Click **Grant access**.

The email you specify is added to the list of **Users with access to the project**. The Neon account associated with that email address is granted full access to the project with the exception privileges required to delete the project. This account can also share the project with other Neon users. When that user logs in to Neon, the shared project is listed on their **Projects** page, under **Shared with me**.

The costs associated with a shared project are charged to the Neon account that owns the project. For example, if you share your project with another Neon user account, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Neon account, not theirs.

For additional information, refer to our [Project sharing guide](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

## Advanced settings

From the **Project settings** page, you can also set defaults or apply bulk changes across your Neon objects:

- [Reset default compute size](#reset-the-default-compute-size)
- [Configure history retention range](#configure-history-retention)
- [Enable logical replication](#enable-logical-replication)
- [Configure IP Allow](#configure-ip-allow)

### Reset the default compute size

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU is equal to 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. Currently, a Neon compute endpoint can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. Larger compute sizes will be supported in a future release.

For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, Neon sets your compute size to a static shared 1 vCPU, with 1 GB of RAM for each branch (max 10 branches).

Users on paid plans have the flexibility to choose a compute size for each branch's compute endpoint individually. By default, new branches inherit the compute endpoint size from your first branch (i.e., `main`). However, there may be times when you want to reset this default. For example, if you want to create a series of read-only replicas, where each replica typically requires less compute per branch.

To reset the default compute size, go to **Project settings** > **Compute**.

You can choose from two options:

- **Fixed Size:** Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries in response to the current load. Currently, the _Autoscaling_ feature supports a range of 1/4 (.25) CU to 7 CUs. The 1/4 CU and 1/2 CU settings are _shared compute_. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

_Example: default minimum and maximum autoscale settings_

![Default autoscaling min and max](/docs/manage/default_autoscale.png)

### Configure history retention

By default, Neon retains a history of changes for all branches in a Neon project, which allows you to create a branch that restores data to any point within the defined retention period. The supported limits are 24 hours for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, 7 days for [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) plan users, and 30 days for [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan users. Please be aware that increasing the history retention period affects all branches in your project and increases [project storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).

To configure the history retention period for a project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Storage**.
    ![History retention configuration](/docs/manage/history_retention.png)
4. Use the slider to select the history retention period.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enable logical replication

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon databases to a variety of external destinations, including data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases.

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication for your project:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level 
-----------
logical
```

After enabling logical replication, the next steps involve creating publications on your replication source database in Neon and configuring subscriptions on the destination system or service. To get started, refer to our [logical replication guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

### Configure IP Allow

Available to [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan users, the IP Allow feature provides an added layer of security for your data, restricting access to the branch where your database resides to only those IP addresses that you specify. In Neon, the IP allowlist is applied to all branches by default. 

Optionally, you can allow unrestricted access to your project's [non-primary branches](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch). For instance, you might want to restrict access to the primary branch to a handful of trusted IPs while allowing unrestricted access to your development branches.

By default, Neon allows IP addresses from `0.0.0.0`, which means that Neon accepts connections from any IP address. Once you configure IP Allow by adding IP addresses or ranges, only those IP addresses will be allowed to access Neon.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon supports both [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4) and [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) addresses.
</Admonition>

2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **IP Allow**.
    ![IP Allow configuration](/docs/manage/ip_allow.png)
4. Specify the IP addresses you want to permit. Separate multiple entries with commas.
5. Optionally, select **Allow unrestricted access to non-primary branches** to allow full access to your [no primary branches](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch).
5. Click **Save changes**.

The [Neon CLI ip-allow command](/docs/reference/cli-ip-allow) supports IP Allow configuration. For example, the following `add` command adds IP addresses to the allowlist for an existing Neon project. Multiple entries are separated by a space. No delimiter is required.

```bash
neonctl ip-allow add 203.0.113.0 203.0.113.1
âââââââââââââââââââââââ¬ââââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââ¬ââââââââââââââââââââââ

To apply an IP allowlist to the primary branch only, use the you can `--primary-only` option:

```bash
neonctl ip-allow add 203.0.113.1 --primary-only
```

To reverse that setting, use `--primary-only false`.

```bash
neonctl ip-allow add 203.0.113.1 --primary-only false
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) and [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) methods support **IP Allow** configuration. For example, the following API call configures **IP Allow** for an existing Neon project. Separate multiple entries with commas. Each entry must be quoted. You can set the `"primary_branch_only` option to `true` to apply the allowlist to your primary branch only, or `false` to apply it to all branches in your Neon project.

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
     https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/falling-salad-31638542 \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "allowed_ips": {
        "primary_branch_only": true,
        "ips": [
          "203.0.113.0", "203.0.113.1"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
' | jq
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### How to specify IP addresses

You can define an allowlist with individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). A combination of these options is also permitted. Multiple entries, whether they are the same or of different types, must be separated by a comma. Whitespace is ignored.

- **Add individual IP addresses**: You can add individual IP addresses that you want to allow. This is useful for granting access to specific users or devices. This example represents a single IP address:

  ```text
  192.0.2.1
  ```

- **Define IP ranges**: For broader access control, you can define IP ranges. This is useful for allowing access from a company network or a range of known IPs. This example range includes all IP addresses from `198.51.100.20` to `198.51.100.50`: 

  ```text
  198.51.100.20-198.51.100.50
  ```

- **Use CIDR notation**: For more advanced control, you can use [CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). This is a compact way of defining a range of IPs and is useful for larger networks or subnets. Using CIDR notation can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network.

  This CIDR notation example represents all 256 IP addresses from  `203.0.113.0` to `203.0.113.255`. 

  ```text
  203.0.113.0/24
  ```

- **Use IPv6 addresses**: Neon also supports specifying IPv6 addresses. For example:

  ```text
  2001:DB8:5432::/48
  ```

A combined example using all three options above, specified as a comma-separated list, would appear similar to the following:

  ```text
  192.0.2.1, 198.51.100.20-198.51.100.50, 203.0.113.0/24, 2001:DB8:5432::/48
  ```

This list combines individual IP addresses, a range of IP addresses, a CIDR block, and an IPv6 address. It illustrates how different types of IP specifications can be used together in a single allowlist configuration, offering a flexible approach to access control.

#### Update an IP Allow configuration

You can update your IP Allow configuration via the Neon Console or API as described in [Configure IP Allow](#configure-ip-allow). Replace the current configuration with the new configuration. For example, if your IP Allow configuration currently allows access from IP address `192.0.2.1`, and you want to extend access to IP address `192.0.2.2`, specify both addresses in your new configuration: `192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2`. You cannot append values to an existing configuration. You can only replace an existing configuration with a new one.

The Neon CLI provides an `ip-allow` command with `add`, `reset`, and `remove` options that you can use to update your IP Allow configuration. For instructions, refer to [Neon CLI commands â ip-allow](/docs/reference/cli-ip-allow).

#### Remove an IP Allow configuration

To remove an IP configuration entirely to go back to the default "no IP restrictions" (`0.0.0.0`) configuration:

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **IP Allow**.
4. Clear the **Allowed IP addresses and ranges** field.
5. If applicable, clear the **Apply to primary branch only** checkbox.
5. Click **Apply changes**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The [Neon CLI ip-allow command](/docs/reference/cli-ip-allow) supports removing an IP Allow configuration. To do so, specify `--ip-allow reset` without specifying any IP address values:

```bash
neonctl ip-allow reset
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

Specify the `ips` option with an empty string. If applicable, also include `"primary_branch_only": false`. 

```bash
curl -X PATCH \                                                            
     https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/falling-salad-31638542 \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "allowed_ips": {
        "primary_branch_only": false,
        "ips": []         
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Manage projects with the Neon API

Project actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete projects using the Neon API. For other project-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a project with the API

The following Neon API method creates a project. The [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) permits one project per account. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject).

```http
POST /projects
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `myproject` name value is a user-specified name for the project.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "project": {
    "name": "myproject"
  }
}' | jq
```

The response includes information about the roles, the ready-to-use database (`neondb`), the primary branch (`main`), and the read-write compute endpoint that is created with the project.

# Branches

Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a [primary branch](#primary-branch) called `main`. You can create child branches from `main` or from previously created branches. A branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Tier limits define the number of branches you can create in a project and the amount of data you can store in a branch.

A child branch is a copy-on-write clone of the parent branch. You can modify the data in a branch without affecting the data in the parent branch.
For more information about branches and how you can use them in your development workflows, see [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching).

You can create and manage branches using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). This topic covers both methods.

<Admonition type="important">
When working with branches, it is important to remove old and unused branches. Branches hold a lock on the data they contain, preventing disk space from being reallocated. Neon retains a 7-day data history, by default. You can configure the retention period. See [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore). To keep data storage to a minimum, remove branches before they age out of the history retention window.
</Admonition>

## Primary branch

Each Neon project has a primary branch. In the Neon Console, your primary branch is identified by a `PRIMARY` tag. You can designate any branch as the primary branch for your project. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch, which is typically the branch used in production.

- For Neon Free Tier users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is always available.
- For users on paid plans, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. Neon has a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect your account from unintended usage.

## Non-primary branch

Any branch not designated as the primary branch is considered a non-primary branch. You can rename or delete non-primary branches.

- For Neon Free Tier users, compute endpoints associated with non-primary branches are suspended if you exceed the Neon Free Tier  _active hours_ limit of 20 hours per month.
- For users on paid plans, default limits prevent more than 20 simultaneously active compute endpoints. Beyond that limit, a compute endpoint associated with a non-primary branch remains suspended.

## Create a branch

To create a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
![Create branch dialog](/docs/manage/create_branch.png)
4. Enter a name for the branch.
5. Select a parent branch. You can branch from your Neon project's [primary branch](#primary-branch) or a [non-primary branch](#non-primary-branch).
6. Select an **Include data up to** option to specify the data to be included in your branch.
    - **Current point in time**: Creates a branch with the latest available data from the parent (the default).
    - **Specific date and time**: Creates a branch with data up to a specific date and time, allowing for point-in-time restore.
    - **Specific Log Sequence Number**: Creates a branch with data up to a specific [Log Sequence Number (LSN)](/docs/reference/glossary#lsn) in the database log, allowing for precise point-in-time restore.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The **Specific date and time** and the **Specific Log Sequence Number Data** options do not include data changes that occured after the specified date and time or LSN, which means the branch contains data as it existed previously, allowing for point-in-time restore. You can only specify a date and time or LSN value that falls within your history retention window. See [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).
    </Admonition>

8. Click **Create new branch** to create your branch.

You are directed to the **Branches** page where you are shown the details for your new branch.

## View branches

To view the branches in a Neon project:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table to view details about the branch.
![View branch details](/docs/manage/branch_details.png)

Branch details shown on the branch page include:

- **ID**: The branch ID. Branch IDs have a `br-` prefix.
- **Created**: The date and time the branch was created.
- **Active Time**: The total amount of active hours for your branch compute within the current billing period.
- **Compute Time**: The compute hours used by the branch within the current billing period.
- **Parent Branch**: The branch from which this branch was created (only visible for child branches).
- **Branching point**: The point in time, in terms of data, from which the branch was created.
- **Last data reset**: The last time the branch was reset from the parent branch.

The branch details page also includes details about the compute endpoint associated with the branch. For more information, see [View a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#view-a-compute-endpoint).

## Rename a branch

Neon permits renaming a branch, including your project's primary branch. To rename a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Rename**.
5. Specify a new name for the branch and click **Save**.

## Set a branch as primary

Each Neon project is created with a primary branch called `main`, but you can designate any branch as your project's primary branch. The benefit of the primary branch is that the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch remains accessible if you exceed project limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data on the primary branch. For more information, see [Primary branch](#primary-branch).

To set a branch as the primary branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Set as primary**.
5. In the **Set as primary** confirmation dialog, click **Set as Primary** to confirm your selection.

## Connect to a branch

Connecting to a database in a branch requires connecting via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following steps describe how to connect using `psql` and a connection string obtained from the Neon Console.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can also query the databases in a branch from the Neon SQL Editor. For instructions, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).
</Admonition>

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. On the project **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)
3. Copy the connection string. A connection string includes your role name, the compute endpoint hostname, and database name.
4. Connect with `psql` as shown below.

  ```bash shouldWrap
  psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
  ```

<Admonition type="tip">
A compute endpoint hostname starts with an `ep-` prefix. You can also find a compute endpoint hostname on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. See [View branches](#view-branches).
</Admonition>

If you want to connect from an application, the **Connection Details** widget on the project **Dashboard** and the [Guides](/docs/guides/guides-intro) section in the documentation provide connection examples for various languages and frameworks. For more information about connecting, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Reset a branch from parent

When working with database branches, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to update your working branch to the latest data from your main branch. For example, let's say you have two child branches `staging` and `development` forked from your `main` branch. You have been working on the `development` branch and find it is now too far out of date with `main`. You have no schema changes in `development` to consider or preserve; you just want a quick refresh of the data. With the **Reset from parent** feature, you can perform a clean reset to the latest data from the parent in a single operation, saving you the complication of manually creating and restoring branches.

<u>Key points</u>:

- You can only reset a branch to the latest data from its parent. Point-in-time resets based on timestamp or LSN are not currently supported.
- This reset is a complete overwrite, not a refresh or a merge. Any local changes made to the child branch are lost during this reset.
- Existing connections will be temporarily interrupted during the reset. However, your connection details _do not change_. All connections are re-established as soon as the reset is done.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
On the **Branches** page in the Neon Console, select the branch that you want to reset.

The console opens to the details page for your branch, giving you key information about the branch and its child status: its parent, the last time it was reset, and other relevent detail.

To reset the branch, select **Reset from parent** from either the **More** dropdown or the **Last Data Reset** panel.

![Reset from parent](/docs/manage/reset_from_parent.png)

<Admonition type="note">
If this branch has children of its own, resetting is blocked. The resulting error dialog lets you delete these child branches, after which you can continue with the reset.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Using the CLI, you can reset a branch from parent using the following command:

``` bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent
```

In the `id|name` field, specify the branch ID or name of the child branch whose data you want to reset. The `--parent` parameter specifies the kind of reset action that Neon will perform. In the future, there may be other kinds of resets available. For example, rewinding a branch to an earlier period in time.

If you have multiple projects in your account, you'll also have to include the `project-id` in the command along with the branch.

``` bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent --project-id <project id>
```

Example:

``` bash
neonctl branches reset development --parent --project-id noisy-pond-12345678
```

Alternatively, you can set the `project-id` as a background context for your CLI session, letting you perform other actions against that project without having to include the `project-id` in every command. The setting is saved in a `context-file` and remains in place until you set a new context, or you remove the `context-file`.

```bash
neonctl set-context --project-id <project id>
```

Read more about performing branching actions from the CLI in [CLI - branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches), and more about setting contexts in [CLI - set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context).

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
To reset a branch to its parent using the API, use the branch restore endpoint, selecting the parent as the source:

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id_to_restore}/restore
```

For details, see [Branch Restore using the API](/docs/guides/branch-restore#how-to-use-branch-restore)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Restore a branch to its own or another branch's history

There are several restore operations available using Neon's Branch Restore feature:

- Restore a branch to its own history
- Restore a branch to the head of another branch
- Restore a branch to the history of another branch

You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API. For more detail, see [Branch Restore](/docs/guide/branch-restore).

## Delete a branch

Deleting a branch is a permanent action. Deleting a branch also deletes the databases and roles that belong to the branch as well as the compute endpoint associated with the branch. You cannot delete a branch that has child branches. The child branches must be deleted first.

To delete a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Delete**.
4. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Check the data size

Tier limits define the amount of data you can store in a branch. The [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) permits 3 GiB per branch. When creating a new branch, the child branch includes the data from the parent branch. For example, if you have a branch with 1 GiB of data, the child branch is created with the same 1 GiB of data.

You can check the data size for a branch by viewing the `Database size` value on the branch details page (see [View branches](#view-branches)). Alternatively, you can run the following query from the Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(sum(pg_database_size(datname)))
FROM pg_database;
```

<Admonition type="info">
Neon stores data in its own internal format.
</Admonition>

## Branching with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI supports creating and managing branches. For instructions, see [Neon CLI commands â branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches). For a Neon CLI branching guide, see [Branching with the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches).

## Branching with the Neon API

Branch actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all of the attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a branch with the API

The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch).

```http
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches 
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `endpoints` attribute creates a compute endpoint, which is required to connect to the branch. A branch can be created with or without a compute endpoint. The `branch` attribute specifies the parent branch.

<Admonition type="note">
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's primary branch, and a compute endpoint is not created.
</Admonition>

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{

    {
      "type": "read_write"
    }
  ],
  "branch": {
    "parent_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433"
  }
}' | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Project settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API.
- The `parent_id` can be obtained by listing the branches for your project. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api). The `<parent_id>` is the `id` of the branch you are branching from. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. You can branch from your Neon project's primary branch or a previously created branch.

The response body includes information about the branch, the branch's compute endpoint, and the `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations that were initiated.

A single read-write compute endpoint is created for your project's [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch), by default.

To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following diagram shows the project's primary branch (`main`) and a child branch, both of which have an associated compute endpoint.

```text
Project
    |----primary branch (main) ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
             |    |
             |    |---- database (neondb)
             |
             ---- child branch ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
                            |
                            |---- database (mydb)
```

Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

Tier limits define resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. The  [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) provides a shared vCPU and up to 1 GB of RAM per compute endpoint. Paid plans support larger compute sizes and autoscaling.

## View a compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is associated with a branch. To view a compute endpoint, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute endpoint, it is shown on the branch page.

Compute endpoint details shown on the branch page include:

- **Id**: The compute endpoint ID.
-- **Type**: The type of compute endpoint. `R/W` (Read-write) or `R/O` (Read-only).
- **Status**: The compute endpoint status (`Active`, `Idle`, or `Stopped`).
- **Compute size**: The size of the compute endpoint. Users on paid plans can configure the amount of vCPU and RAM for a compute endpoint when creating or editing a compute endpoint. Shows autoscaling minimum and maximum vCPU values if autoscaling is enabled.
- **Auto-suspend delay**: The number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Autosuspend configuration](#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Last active**: The date and time the compute was last active.

## Create a compute endpoint

You can only create a read-write compute endpoint for a branch that does not have one, but a branch can have multiple read-only compute endpoints (referred to as "read replicas"). [Read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) are a paid plan feature.

To create an endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch that does not have an endpoint
1. Click **Add compute**.
1. On the **Create compute endpoint** dialog, specify your settings and click **Create**. Selecting **Read-only** creates a [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

## Edit a compute endpoint

Neon paid plan users can edit a compute endpoint to change the [compute size](#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Autosuspend](#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
   
   The **Edit** window opens, letting you take a range of actions, depending on your tier.
1. Once you've made your changes, click **Save**. All changes take immediate effect.

For information about selecting an appropriate compute size, see [How to size your compute](#how-to-size-your-compute).

### What happens to the compute endpoint when making changes

Some key points to understand about how your endpoint responds when you make changes to your compute settings:

* Changing the size of your fixed compute restarts the endpoint and _temporarily disconnects all existing connections_. 
  <Admonition type="note">
  When your compute resizes automatically as part of the autoscaling feature, there are no restarts or disconnects; it just scales. 
  </Admonition>
* Editing minimum or maximum autoscaling sizes also requires a restart; existing connections are temporarily disconnected.
* Changes to autosuspend settings do not require an endpoint restart; existing connections are unaffected.

### Compute size and autoscaling configuration

Users on paid plans can change compute size settings when [editing a compute endpoint](#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the vCPUs, as shown in the table below.

| Compute size (in CUs)  | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |

Neon supports fixed-size and autoscaling compute configurations.

- **Fixed size:** You can use the slider to select a fixed compute size. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** You can also use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries to meet workload demand. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

<Admonition type="info">
The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).

### How to size your compute

The size of your compute determines the amount of memory available to cache your frequently accessed data and the maximum number of simultaneous connections you can support. As a result, if your compute size is too small, this can lead to suboptimal query performance and connection limit issues. 

In Postgres, the `shared_buffers` setting defines the amount of data that can be held in memory. In Neon, the `shared_buffers` parameter is always set to 128 MB, but Neon uses a local file cache to extend the amount of memory allocated to shared buffers to 50% of your compute's RAM. The 50% RAM limit is a guideline rather than an enforced limit, but it's advisable not to exceed this maximum; otherwise, you might encounter out-of-memory errors.

The Postgres `max_connections` setting defines your compute's maximum simultaneous connection limit and is set according to your compute size. Larger computes support higher maximum connection limits.

The following table outlines the vCPU, RAM, `shared_buffer` limit (50 % of RAM), and the `max_connections` limit for each compute size that Neon supports.

| Compute Size (CU) | vCPU | RAM   | shared_buffers | max_connections | 
|--------------|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.25         | 0.25 | 1 GB  | 0.5 GB         | 112             |
| 0.50         | 0.50 | 2 GB  | 1 GB           | 225             |
| 1            | 1    | 4 GB  | 2 GB           | 450             |
| 2            | 2    | 8 GB  | 4 GB           | 901             |
| 3            | 3    | 12 GB | 6 GB           | 1351            |
| 4            | 4    | 16 GB | 8 GB           | 1802            |
| 5            | 5    | 20 GB | 10 GB          | 2253            |
| 6            | 6    | 24 GB | 12 GB          | 2703            |
| 7            | 7    | 28 GB | 14 GB          | 3154            |
| 8            | 8    | 32 GB | 16 GB          | 3,604           |


<Admonition type="note">
Users on paid plans can configure the size of their computes. The compute size for Free Tier users is set at .25 CU (.25 vCPU and 1 GB RAM).
</Admonition> 

When selecting a compute size, ideally, you want to keep as much of your dataset in memory as possible. This improves performance by reducing the amount of reads from storage. If your dataset is not too large, select a compute size that will hold the entire dataset in memory. For larger datasets that cannot be fully held in memory, select a compute size that can hold your [working set](/docs/reference/glossary#working-set).

Regarding connection limits, you'll want a compute size that can support your anticipated maximum number of concurrent connections. If you are using _Autoscaling_, it is important to remember that your `max_connections` setting is based on the _minimum compute size_ in your autoscaling configuration. The `max_connections` setting does not scale with your compute. To avoid the `max_connections` constraint, you can use a pooled connection with your application, which supports up to 10,000 concurrent user connections. See [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).



#### Autoscaling considerations

Autoscaling is most effective when your data (either your full dataset or your working set) can be fully cached in memory on the minimum compute size in your autoscaling configuration.

Consider this scenario: If your data size is approximately 6 GB, starting with a compute size of .25 CU can lead to suboptimal performance because your data cannot be adequately cached. While your compute _will_ scale up from .25 CU on demand, you may experience poor query performance until your compute scales up and fully caches your working set. You can avoid this issue if your minimum compute size can hold your working set in memory.

As mentioned above, your `max_connections` setting is based on the minimum compute size in your autoscaling configuration and does not scale along with your compute. To avoid this `max_connections` constraint, you can use a pooled connection for your application. See [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

### Autosuspend configuration

Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this delay can be adjusted. For instance, you can increase the delay to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable autosuspend completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute endpoint but is likely to increase your compute time usage.

The maximum **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting is 7 days. To configure a compute as "always-active", deselect **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity**. For more information, refer to [Configuring autosuspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

## Restart a compute endpoint

It is sometimes necessary to restart a compute endpoint. For example, if you upgrade to a paid plan account, you may want to restart your compute endpoint to immediately apply your upgraded limits.

<Admonition type="important">
Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint interrupts any connections currently using the compute endpoint.
</Admonition>

You can restart a compute endpoint using one of the following methods:

- Stop activity on your compute endpoint (stop running queries) and wait for your compute endpoint to suspend due to inactivity. By default, Neon suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can watch the status of your compute on the **Branches** page in the Neon console. Select your branch and monitor your compute's **Status** field. Wait for it to report an `Idle` status. The compute will restart the next time it's accessed, and the status will change to `Active`. 
- Issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. You can do this directly from the [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), using the **Try It!** feature. You'll need an [API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- Users on paid plans can temporarily set a compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second to initiate a restart (the default setting is 5 minutes). See [Autosuspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions.

## Delete a compute endpoint

Deleting a compute endpoint is a permanent action.

To delete a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API

Compute endpoint actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete compute endpoints using the Neon API. For other compute endpoint API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method creates a compute endpoint.

```http
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The branch you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint. Neon  supports read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are for creating [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

# Roles

In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. Each Neon project is created with a default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the email, GitHub, Google, or partner account that you registered with). This role owns the ready-to-use database (`neondb`) that is created in your Neon project's primary branch.

Your default Postgres role and roles created in the Neon console, API, and CLI are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neonsuperuser-role) role. Roles created with SQL from clients like [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) are only granted the basic [public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

<Admonition type="note">
Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres `superuser` account like you can in a standalone Postgres installation.
</Admonition>

You can create roles in a project's primary branch or child branches. There is no limit to the number of roles you can create.

In Neon, roles belong to a branch, which could be your main branch or a child branch. When you create a child branch, roles in the parent branch are duplicated in the child branch. For example, if role `alex` exists in the parent branch, role `alex` is copied to the child branch when the child branch is created. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that only includes data up to a particular point in time. If the role was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.

Neon supports creating and managing roles from the following interfaces:

- [Neon console](#manage-roles-in-the-neon-console)
- [Neon CLI](#manage-roles-with-the-neon-cli)
- [Neon API](#manage-roles-with-the-neon-api)
- [SQL](#manage-roles-with-sql)

## The neon_superuser role

Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. Users cannot login as `neon_superuser`, but they inherit the privileges assigned to this role. The privileges and predefined role memberships granted to `neon_superuser` include:

- `CREATEDB`: Provides the ability to create databases.
- `CREATEROLE`: Provides the ability to create new roles (which also means it can alter and drop roles).
- `BYPASSRLS`: Provides the ability to bypass row-level security (RLS) policies. This attribute is only included in `neon_superuser` roles in projects created after the [August 15, 2023 release](/docs/changelog/2023-08-15-storage-and-compute).
- `REPLICATION`: Provides the ability to connect to a Postgres server in replication mode and create or drop replication slots.
- `NOLOGIN`: The role cannot be used to log in to the Postgres server. Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system directly.
- `pg_read_all_data`: A predefined Postgres role provides the ability to read all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having `SELECT` rights on those objects, and `USAGE` rights on all schemas.
- `pg_write_all_data`: A predefined Postgres role that provides the ability to write all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` rights on those objects, and `USAGE` rights on all schemas.
- `pg_create_subscription`:	A predefined Postgres role that lets users with `CREATE` permission on the database issue `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`. The `pg_create_subscription` role is only available as of Postgres 16. The `neon_superuser` role in Postgres 14 and 15 can issue `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` with only `CREATE` permission on the database.
- `pg_monitor`: A predefined Postgres role that provides read/execute privileges on various Postgres monitoring views and functions. The `neon_superuser` role also has `WITH ADMIN` on the `pg_monitor` role, which enables granting the `pg_monitor` to other Postgres roles.
- `EXECUTE` privilege on the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function that is part of the `pg_stat_statements` extension. This privilege was introduced with the January 12, 2024 release. If you installed the `pg_stat_statements` extension prior to this release, drop and recreate the `pg_stat_statements` extension to enable this privilege. See [Install an extension](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#install-an-extension).
- `GRANT ALL ON TABLES` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` on the `public` schema.
- `GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES` and `WITH GRANT OPTION` on the `public` schema.

You can think of roles with `neon_superuser` privileges as administrator roles. If you require roles with limited privileges, such as a read-only role, you can create those roles from an SQL client. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

<Admonition type="note">
Creating a database with the `neon_superuser` role, altering a database to have owner `neon_superuser`, and altering the `neon_superuser role` itself are _not_ permitted. This `NOLOGIN` role is not intended to be used directly or modified.
</Admonition>

## Manage roles in the Neon console

This section describes how to create, view, and delete roles in the Neon Console. All roles created in the Neon console are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neonsuperuser-role) role.

### Create a role

To create a role:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name. The length of the role name is limited to 63 bytes.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

<Admonition type="note">
Role names cannot exceed 63 characters, and some names are not permitted. See [Protected role names](#protected-role-names).
</Admonition>

### Delete a role

Deleting a role is a permanent action that cannot be undone, and you cannot delete a role that owns a database. The database must be deleted before you can deleting the role that owns the database.

To delete a role:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select a branch to view roles in the branch.
5. Click the delete icon for the role you want to delete.
6. On the delete role dialog, click **Delete**.

### Reset a password

To reset a role's password:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select a branch to view roles in the branch.
5. Select **Reset password**.
6. On the confirmation dialog, click **Sure, reset**. A reset password dialog is displayed with your new password.

<Admonition type="note">
Resetting a password in the Neon Console resets the password to a generated value. To set your own password value, you can reset the password using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or an SQL client like [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) with the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

For password requirements, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).
</Admonition>

## Manage roles with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI supports creating and deleting roles. For instructions, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](/docs/reference/cli-roles). Roles created with the Neon CLI are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neonsuperuser-role) role.

## Manage roles with the Neon API

Role actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using Neon API role methods. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, reset passwords for, and delete roles using the Neon API. For other role-related methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

Roles created with the Neon API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neonsuperuser-role) role.

In Neon, roles belong to branches, which means that when you create a role, it is created in a branch. Role-related requests are therefore performed using branch API methods.

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all  attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a role with the API

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole).

## Manage roles with SQL

Roles created with SQL have the same basic `public` schema privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neonsuperuser-role) role like roles created with the Neon Console, CLI, or API. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have.

To create a role with SQL, issue a `CREATE ROLE` statement from a client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

```sql
CREATE ROLE <name> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

- `WITH LOGIN` means that the role will have a login privilege, required for the role to log in to your Neon Postgres instance. If the role is used only for privilege management, the `WITH LOGIN` privilege is unnecessary.
- A password is required and must have a minimum entropy of 60 bits.

    <Admonition type="info">  
    To create a password with 60 bits of entropy, you can follow these password composition guidelines:
    - **Length**: The password should consist of at least 12 characters.
    - **Character diversity**: To enhance complexity, passwords should include a variety of character types, specifically:
      - Lowercase letters (a-z)
      - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
      - Numbers (0-9)
      - Special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
    - **Avoid predictability**: To maintain a high level of unpredictability, do not use:
      - Sequential patterns (such as '1234', 'abcd', 'qwerty')
      - Common words or phrases
      - Any words found in a dictionary
      - **Avoid character repetition**: To maximize randomness, do not use the same character more than twice consecutively.

    Example password: `T3sting!23Ab` (DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE PASSWORD)

    Passwords must be supplied in plain text but are encrypted when stored. Hashed passwords are not supported.

    The guidelines should help you create a password with approximately 60 bits of entropy. However, depending on the exact characters used, the actual entropy might vary slightly. Always aim for a longer and more complex password if you're uncertain. It's also recommended to use a trusted password manager to create and store your complex passwords safely.
    </Admonition>

For role creation and access management examples, refer to the [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access) guide.

## Protected role names

The following names are protected and cannot be given to a role:

- Any name starting with `pg_`
- `neon_superuser`
- `cloud_admin`
- `zenith_admin`
- `public`
- `none`

# Databases

A database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In the [Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview), a database exists within a branch of a project. There is no limit on the number of databases you can create.

A Neon project's primary branch is created with a ready-to-use database called `neondb`, which is owned by your project's default role (see [Manage roles](/docs/manage/roles) for more information). You can create your own databases in a project's primary branch or in a child branch.

All databases in Neon are created with a `public` schema. SQL objects are created in the `public` schema, by default. For more information about the `public` schema, refer to [The Public schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PUBLIC), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.

<Admonition type="note">
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the `CREATE` privilege on a database's `public` schema. For other users, the `CREATE` privilege must be granted manually via a `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;` statement. For more information, see [Public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges).
</Admonition>

Databases belong to a branch. If you create a child branch, databases from the parent branch are copied to the child branch. For example, if database `mydb` exists in the parent branch, it will be copied to the child branch. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that includes data up to a particular point in time. If a database was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.

Neon supports creating and managing databases from the following interfaces:

- [Neon console](#manage-databases-in-the-neon-console)
- [Neon CLI](#manage-databases-with-the-neon-cli)
- [Neon API](#manage-databases-with-the-neon-api)
- [SQL](#manage-databases-with-sql)

## Manage databases in the Neon console

This section describes how to create, view, and delete databases in the Neon Console.

The role that creates a database is automatically made the owner of that database. The `neon_superuser` role is also granted all privileges on databases created in the Neon consoles. For information about this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

### Create a database

To create a database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select the branch where you want to create the database.
1. Click **New Database**.
1. Enter a database name, and select a database owner.
1. Click **Create**.

<Admonition type="note">
Some names are not permitted. See [Protected database names](#protected-database-names).
</Admonition>

### View databases

To view databases:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select a branch to view the databases in the branch.

### Delete a database

Deleting a database is a permanent action. All database objects belonging to the database such as schemas, tables, and roles are also deleted.

To delete a database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select a branch to view the databases in the branch.
1. For the database you want to delete, click the delete icon.
1. In the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage databases with SQL

You can create and manage databases in Neon with SQL, as you can with any standalone Postgres installation. To create a database, issue a `CREATE DATABASE` statement from a client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

Most standard [Postgres CREATE DATABASE parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) are supported with the exception of `TABLESPACE`. This parameter requires access to the local file system, which is not permitted in Neon.

The role that creates a database is the owner of the database.

<Admonition type="note">
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the `CREATE` privilege on a database's `public` schema. For other users, the `CREATE` privilege on the `public` schema must be granted explicitly via a `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;` statement. For more information, see [Public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges).
</Admonition>

For more information about database object privileges in Postgres, see [Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).

## Protected database names

The following names are protected and cannot be given to a database:

- `postgres`
- `template0`
- `template1`

An operation is an action performed by the Neon Control Plane on a Neon object or resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Other operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) after a period of inactivity or checking its availability. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status of specific operations. When working with the Neon API, you can poll the status of operations to ensure that an API request is completed before issuing the next API request. For more information, see [Poll operation status](#poll-operation-status).

| Operation | Description  |
|:---|:---|
| `apply_config` | Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating  PostgreSQL users and databases initiates this operation. |
| `apply_storage_config` | Applies a new configuration to a Neon storage object or resource. For example, updating the history retention period for a project initiates this operation.  |
| `check_availability`  | Checks the availability of data in a branch and that a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) can start on a branch. Branches without a compute endpoint are not checked. This operation, performed by the [availability checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker), is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. |
| `create_branch`  | Creates a [branch](/docs/reference/glossary#branch) in a Neon project. For related information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).  |
| `create_timeline`  | Creates a [project](/docs/reference/glossary#project) with a primary branch.  |
| `delete_tenant`  | Deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted.  |
| `start_compute`   |Starts a compute endpoint when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute endpoint initiates this operation.  |
| `suspend_compute`  | Suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle/).  |

## View operations

You can view operations via the Neon Console, [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli), or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

## Operations and the Neon API

This section describes how to work with operations using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following topics are covered:

- [List operations](#list-operations): Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project.
- [List operations with pagination](#list-operations-with-pagination): Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project and paginate the response.
- [Get operation](#get-operation): Describes how to retrieve the details for a specific operation by the operation ID.
- [Poll operation status](#poll-operation-status): Describes how to poll an operation for its status, which may be necessary to avoid failed requests due to in-progress operations when using the Neon API programmatically.

### List operations

## Poll operation status

Some Neon API requests may take a few moments to complete. When using the Neon API programmatically, you can check the `status` of an operation before proceeding with the next API request. For example, you may want to check the operation status of a create branch request before issuing a create database request for that branch.

The response to a Neon API request includes information about the operations that were initiated. For example, a create branch request initiates `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations.

```json
"operations": [
    {
      "id": "22acbb37-209b-4b90-a39c-8460090e1329",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "action": "create_branch",
      "status": "running",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "start_compute",
      "status": "scheduling",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
    }
  ]
  ```

You can use the [Get operation details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectoperations) method to poll the status of an operation by the operation ID. You might do this at intervals of 5 seconds until the `status` of the operation changes to `finished` before issuing the next request. For example, this request polls the `start_compute` operation shown above:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations/055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

<details>
<summary>Response body</summary>

```json
{
  "operation": {
      "id": "055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "start_compute",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
  }
}
```

</details>

Possible operation `status` values include `running`, `finished`, `failed`, `scheduling`. Initially, the status of an operation might be `scheduling`. Before issuing the next API request, you would poll the operation until the status changes to `finished`. You could also add logic to handle a `failed` status.

You to share a Neon project with other Neon users.

Users that you share a project with are able to perform any action you can perform in the project, with the exception of deleting the project. For example, users you share a project with are able to:

- Create and delete branches
- Create and delete databases
- Create and delete roles
- Create and delete computes
- Modify project settings
- View data
- Run queries

You can think of sharing a Neon project as granting administrator access to your project.

## How to share a project

Sharing a project is performed from the **Project settings** page in your Neon project.

Each Neon project is created with a default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the account you registered with). For example, if a user named "Alex" signs up for Neon, the project is created with a default role named `alex`.

The default Postgres role is automatically assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, and sequences. Any user created with the Neon console, Neon API, or Neon CLI is also assigned the `neon_superuser` role.

It is good practice to reserve `neon_superuser` roles for database administration tasks like creating roles and databases. For other users, we recommend creating roles with specific sets of permissions based on application and access requirements. Then, assign the appropriate roles to your users. The roles you create should adhere to a _least privilege_ model, granting only the permissions required to accomplish their tasks.

But how do you create roles with limited access? The following sections describe how to create read-only and read-write roles and assign those roles to users. We'll also look at how to create a "developer" role and grant that role full access to a database on a development branch in a Neon project.

## A word about users, groups, and roles in Postgres

In Postgres, users, groups, and roles are the same thing. From the PostgreSQL [Database Roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html) documentation:

_PostgreSQL manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. A role can be thought of as either a database user, or a group of database users, depending on how the role is set up._

Neon recommends granting privileges to roles, and then assigning those roles to your database users.

## Creating roles with limited access

You can create roles with limited access via SQL. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic [public schema privileges](#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object.

The recommended approach to creating roles with limited access is as follows:

1. Use your  default Neon role or another role with `neon_superuser` privileges to create roles for each application or use case via SQL. For example, create `readonly` and `readwrite` roles.
2. Grant privileges to those roles to allow access to database objects. For example, grant the `SELECT` privilege to a `readonly` role, or grant `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges to a `readwrite` role.
3. Create your database users. For example, create users named `readonly_user1` and `readwrite_user1`.
4. Assign the `readonly` or `readwrite` role to those users to grant them the privileges associated with those roles. For example, assign the `readonly` role to `readonly_user1`, and the `readwrite` role to `readwrite_user1`.

<Admonition type="note">
You can remove a role from a user at any time to revoke privileges. See [Revoke privileges](#revoke-privileges).
</Admonition>

## Create a read-only role

This section describes how to create a read-only role with access to a specific database and schema. An SQL statement summary is provided at the end.

In Postgres, access must be granted at the database, schema, and object level. For example, to grant access to a table, you must also grant access to the database and schema in which the table resides. If these access permissions are not defined, the role will not be able access the table.
</Admonition>

To create a read-only role:

1. Connect to your database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Create a `readonly` role using the following statement. A password is required.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readonly PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```
  
    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

3. Grant the `readonly` role read-only privileges on the schema. Replace `<database>` and `<schema>` with actual database and schema names, respectively.

    ```sql
    -- Grant permission to connect to the database
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readonly;

    -- Grant USAGE on the schema 
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;

    -- Grant SELECT on all existing tables in the schema
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly; 

    -- Grant SELECT on all tables added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
    ```

4. Create a database user. The password requirements mentioned above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readonly_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `readonly` role to `readonly_user1`:

    ```sql
    GRANT readonly TO readonly_user1;
    ```

    The `readonly_user1` user now has read-only access to tables in the specified schema and database and should be able to connect and run `SELECT` queries.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://readonly_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM <schema>.<table_name>;
    ```

    If the user attempts to perform an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation, a `permission denied` error is returned.

### SQL statement summary

To create the read-only role and user described above, run the following statements from an SQL client:

```sql
-- readonly role
CREATE ROLE readonly PASSWORD '<password>';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;

-- User creation
CREATE USER readonly_user1 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT readonly TO readonly_user1;
```

## Create a read-write role

This section describes how to create a read-write role with access to a specific database and schema. An SQL statement summary is provided at the end.

To create a read-write role:

1. Connect to your database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Create a `readwrite` role using the following statement. A password is required.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readwrite PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

3. Grant the `readwrite` role read-write privileges on the schema. Replace `<database>` and `<schema>` with actual database and schema names, respectively.

     ```sql
    -- Grant permission to connect to the database
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE and CREATE on the schema
    GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all existing tables in the schema
     GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite; 

    -- grant SELECT on all tables added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE on all sequences in the schema
    GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE on all sequences added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO readwrite;
    ```

4. Create a database user. The password requirements mentioned above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readwrite_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `readwrite` role to `readwrite_user1`:

    ```sql
    GRANT readwrite TO readwrite_user1;
    ```

    The `readwrite_user1` user now has read-write access to tables in the specified schema and database and should able to connect and run `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` queries.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://readwrite_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> INSERT INTO <table_name> (col1, col2) VALUES (1, 2);
    ```

### SQL statement summary

To create the read-write role and user described above, run the following statements from an SQL client:

```sql
-- readwrite role
CREATE ROLE readwrite PASSWORD '<password>';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readwrite;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO readwrite;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO readwrite;

-- User creation
CREATE USER readwrite_user1 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT readwrite TO readwrite_user1;
```

## Create a developer role

This section describes how to create a "development branch" and grant developers full access to a database on the development branch. To accomplish this, we create a developer role on the "parent" branch, create a development branch, and then assign users to the developer role on the development branch.

As you work through the steps in this scenario, remember that when you create a branch in Neon, you are creating a clone of the parent branch, which includes the roles and databases on the parent branch.

To get started:

1. Connect to the database **on the parent branch** from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Use your default Neon role or another role with `neon_superuser` privileges to create a developer role **on the parent branch**. For example, create a role named `dev_users`.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE dev_users PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

2. Grant the `dev_users` role privileges on the database:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO dev_users;
    ```

    You now have a `dev_users` role on your parent branch, and the role is not assigned to any users. This role will now be included in all future branches created from this branch.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The `GRANT` statement above does not grant privileges on existing schemas, tables, sequences, etc., within the database. If you want the `dev_users` role to access specific schemas, tables, etc., you need to grant those permissions explicitly.

    For example, to grant all privileges on all tables in a schema:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO dev_users;
    ```

    Similarly, you'd grant privileges for sequences and other objects as needed.

    That said, the `GRANT` command above allows users with the `dev_users` role to create new schemas within the database. But for pre-existing schemas and their objects, you need to grant permissions explicitly.
    </Admonition>

3. Create a development branch. Name it something like `dev1`. See [Create a branch](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch) for instructions.

4. Connect to the database **on the development branch** with an SQL client. Be mindful that a child branch connection string differs from a parent branch connection string. The branches reside on different hosts. If you need help connecting to your branch, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

4. After connecting the database on your new branch, create a developer user (e.g., `dev_user1`). The password requirements described above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE dev_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `dev_users` role to the `dev_user1` user:

    ```sql
    GRANT dev_users TO dev_user1;
    ```

    The `dev_user1` user can now connect to the database on your development branch and start using the database with full privileges.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://dev_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> 
    ```

### SQL statement summary

```sql
-- dev_users role
CREATE ROLE dev_users PASSWORD `password`;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO dev_users;

-- optionally, grant access to an existing schema
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO dev_users;

-- User creation
CREATE ROLE dev_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT dev_users TO dev_user1;
```

## Revoke privileges

If you set up privilege-holding roles as describe above, you can revoke privileges by removing assigned roles. For example, to remove the `readwrite` role from `readwrite_user1`, run the following SQL statement:

```sql
REVOKE readwrite FROM readwrite_user1;
```

## Public schema privileges

When creating a new database, Postgres creates a schema named `public` in the database and permits access to the schema to a predefined Postgres role named `public`. Newly created roles in Postgres are automatically assigned the `public` role. In Postgres 14, the public role has `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on the `public` schema. In Postgres 15 and higher, the `public` role has only `USAGE` privileges on the `public` schema.

Why does this matter? If you create a new role and want to limit access for that role, you should be aware of the default `public` schema access automatically assigned to newly created roles.

If you want to limit access to the `public` schema for your users, you have to revoke privileges on the `public` schema explicitly.

For users of Postgres 14, the SQL statement to revoke the default `CREATE` permission on the `public` schema from the `public` role is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

You must be the owner of the `public` schema or a member of a role that authorizes you to execute this SQL statement.

To restrict the `public` roleâs capability to connect to a database, use this statement:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE <database> FROM PUBLIC;
```

This ensures users are unable to connect to a database by default unless this permission is explicitly granted.

## More information

For more information about granting privileges in Postgres, please see the [GRANT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html) command in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.


# Backups

Neon does not yet provide support for configuring automated backups in the Neon Console or API. This feature is on our roadmap. You can expect it to be introduced in the coming months. In the meantime, we support the following backup options:

## Built-in backups with Neon's point-in-time restore feature

Neon retains a history for all branches, allowing you to restore your data to a particular date and time or Log Sequence Number (LSN). The history retention period is configurable. The supported limits are 24 hours for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, 7 days for [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) plan users, and 30 days for [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan users. With this backup option, no action or automation is required. You can restore your data to a past state at any time by creating a database branch, which is a near-instant operation. This feature is referred to as [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore).

For information about creating a point-in-time restore branch, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

## pg_dump

You can backup a database using `pg_dump`, in the same way backups are created for a standalone Postgres instance.

<Admonition type="important">
Avoid using `pg_dump` over a [pooled Neon connection](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-pooling) (see PgBouncer issues [452](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/452) & [976](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/976) for details). Use an unpooled connection instead.
</Admonition>

This method dumps a single database in a single branch of your Neon project. If you need to create backups for multiple databases in multiple branches, you must perform a dump operation for each database in each branch separately.

To dump a database from your Neon project, please refer to the `pg_dump` instructions in our [Import from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres) guide.

# Logical replication

<LRNotice/>

Logical Replication is a method of replicating data between databases or between your database and other data services or platforms. It differs from physical replication in that it replicates transactional changes rather than copying the entire database byte-for-byte. This approach allows for selective replication, where users can choose specific tables or rows for replication. It works by capturing DML operations in the source database and applying these changes to the target, which could be another Postgres database or data platform. 

With logical replication, you can copy some or all of your data to a different location and continue sending updates from your source database in real-time, allowing you to maintain up-to-date copies of your data in different locations.

<Admonition type="note">
For step-by-step setup instructions, refer to our [logical replication guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).
</Admonition>

## Publisher subscriber model

The Postgres logical replication architecture is very simple. It uses a _publisher and subscriber_ model for data replication. The primary data source is the _publisher_, and the database or platform receiving the data is the _subscriber_. On the initial connection from a subscriber, all the data is copied from the publisher to the subscriber. After the initial copy operation, any changes made on the publisher are sent to the subscriber. You can read more about this model in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

![Logical replication publisher subscriber archtitecture](/docs/guides/logical_replication_model.jpg)

## Enabling logical replication

In Neon, you can enable logical replication from the Neon Console:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Replication**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

Enabling logical replication turns on detailed logging, which is required to support the replication process. This increases the amount of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). Typically, you can expect a 10% to 30% increase in the amount of data written to the WAL, depending on the extent of write activity.

## Publications

The Postgres documentation describes a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) as a group of tables whose data changes are intended to be replicated through logical replication. It also describes a publication as a set of changes generated from a table or a group of tables. It's indeed both of these things.

A particular table can be included in multiple publications if necessary. Currently, publications can only include tables within a single schema.

Publications can specify the types of changes they replicate, which can include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` operations. By default, publications replicate all of these operation types. 

You can create a publication for one or more on the "publisher" database using [CREATE PUBLICATION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html) syntax. For example, this command creates a publication named `users_publication` that tracks changes made to a `users` table.

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
```

## Subscriptions

A subscription represents the downstream side of logical replication. It establishes a connection to the publisher and identifies the publication it intends to subscribe to. 

A single subscriber can maintain multiple subscriptions, including multiple subscriptions to the same publisher. 

You can create a subscription on a "susbcriber" database or platform using [CREATE SUBSCRIPTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsubscription.html) syntax. Building on the `users_publication` example above, hereâs how you would create a subscription:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION users_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION users_publication;
```

A subscription requires a unique name, a database connection string, the name and password of your replication role, and the name of the publication it subscribes to.

## How does it work under the hood?

While the publisher and subscriber model forms the surface of PostgreSQL logical replication, the underlying mechanism is driven by a few key components, described below.

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

The WAL is central to Postgres's data durability and crash recovery mechanisms. In the context of logical replication, the WAL records all changes to your data. For logical replication, the WAL serves as the primary source of data that needs to be replicated. It's the transaction data captured in the WAL that's processed and then relayed from a publisher to a subscriber.

### Replication slots

Replication slots on the publisher database track replication progress, ensuring that no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it. This mechanism helps maintain data consistency and prevent data loss in cases of network interruption or subscriber downtime.

Replication slots are typically created automatically with new subscriptions, but they can be created manually using the `pg_create_logical_replication_slot` function. Some "subscriber" data services and platforms require that you create a dedicated replication slot. This is accomplished using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The first value, `my_replication_slot` is the name given to the replication slot. The second value is the decoder plugin the slot should use. Decoder plugins are discussed below.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter defines the maximum number of replication slots that can be used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default.

```ini
max_replication_slots = 10
```

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

### Decoder plugins

The Postgres replication architecture uses decoder plugins to decode WAL entries into a logical replication stream, making the data understandable for the subscriber. The default decoder plugin for PostgreSQL logical replication is `pgoutput`, and it's included in Postgres by default. You don't need to worry about installing it.

Neon, supports an alternative decoder plugin called `wal2json`. This decoder plugin differs from `pgoutput` in that it converts WAL data into `JSON` format, which is useful for integrating Postgres with systems and applications that work with `JSON` data.

To use this decoder plugin, you'll need to create a dedicated replication slot for it, as shown here:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'wal2json');
```

For for more information about this alternative decoder plugin and how top use it, see [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json).

### WAL senders

WAL senders are processes on the publisher database that read the WAL and send the relevant data to the subscriber. 

The `max_wal_senders` parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender processes that are responsible for streaming WAL data to subscribers. In most cases, you should have one WAL sender process for each subscriber or replication slot to ensure efficient and consistent data replication.

The `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default, which matches the maximum number of replication slots defined by the `max_replication_slots` setting.

```ini
max_wal_senders = 10
```

### WAL receivers

On the subscriber side, WAL receivers receive the replication stream (the decoded WAL data), and apply these changes to the subscriber. The number of WAL receivers is determined by the number of connections made by subscribers.

## Publications

This section outlines how to manage **publications** in your replication setup.

### Create a publication

This command creates a publication named `my_publication` that will track changes made to the `users` table:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users;
```

This command creates a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users, departments;
```

This command creates a publication that only publishes `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations. Delete operations will not be published.

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users
    WITH (publish = 'insert,update');
```

### Add a table to a publication

This command adds a table to a publication:

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ADD TABLE sales;
```

### Remove a table from a publication

This command removes a table from a publication:

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication DROP TABLE sales;
```

### Remove a publication

This command removes a publication:

```sql
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS my_publication;
```

### Recreate a publication

This command recreates a publication within a single transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
  -- drop the publication
  DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS my_publication;

  -- re-create the publication
  CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication;
COMMIT;
```

## Subscriptions

This section outlines how to manage **subscriptions** in your replication setup.

### Create a subscription

Building on the `my_publication` example in the preceding section, hereâs how you can create a subscription:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication;
```

A subscription requires a unique name, a database connection string, the name and password of your replication role, and the name of the publication that it subscribes to.

In the example above, `my_subscription` is the name of the subscription that connects to a publication named `my_publication`. In the example above, you would replace the connection details with your Neon database connection string, which you'll find in the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**.

### Create a subscription with two publications

This command creates a subscription that receives data from two publications:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication, sales_publication;
```

A single subscriber can maintain multiple subscriptions, including multiple subscriptions to the same publisher. 

### Create a subscription to be enabled later

This command creates a subscription with `enabled = false` so that you can enable the scription at a later time:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication
WITH (enabled = false);
```

### Change the publication subscribed to

This command modifies an existing subscription to set it to a different publication:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription SET PUBLICATION new_new_publication;
```

### Change the subscription connection

This command updates the connection details for a subscription:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name CONNECTION 'new_connection_string';
```

### Disable a subscription

This command disables an existing subscription:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription DISABLE;
```

### Drop a subscription

This command drops an existing subscription:

```sql
DROP SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription;
```

## Replication slots

Replication slots are created on the publisher database to track replication progress, ensuring that no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it. This mechanism serves to maintain data consistency and prevent data loss in cases of network interruption or subscriber downtime.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

### Create a replication slot

Replication slots are typically created automatically with new subscriptions, but they can be created manually using the `pg_create_logical_replication_slot` function. Some "subscriber" data services and platforms require that you create a dedicated replication slot. This is accomplished using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The first value, `my_replication_slot` is the name given to the replication slot. The second value is the [decoder plugin](#decoder-plugins) the slot should use.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter defines the maximum number of replication slots that can be used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default.

```ini
max_replication_slots = 10
```

### Remove a replication slot

To drop a logical replication slot that you created, you can use the `pg_drop_replication_slot()` function. For example, if you've already created a replication slot named `my_replication_slot` using `pg_create_logical_replication_slot()`, you can drop it by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('my_replication_slot');
```

This command removes the specified replication slot (`my_replication_slot` in this case) from your database. It's important to ensure that the replication slot is no longer in use or required before dropping it, as this action is irreversible and could affect replication processes relying on this slot.

## Data Definition Language (DDL) operations

Logical replication in Postgres primarily handles Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. However, it does not automatically replicate Data Definition Language (DDL) operations such as `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `DROP TABLE`. This means that schema changes in the publisher database are not directly replicated to the subscriber database.

Manual intervention is required to replicate DDL changes. This can be done by applying the DDL changes separately in both the publisher and subscriber databases or by using third-party tools that can handle DDL replication.

## Monitoring replication

To ensure that your logical replication setup is running as expected, you should monitor replication processes regularly. The [pg_stat_replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW) view displays information about each active replication connection to the publisher.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
```
It provides details like the state of the replication, the last received WAL location, sent location, write location, and the delay between the publisher and subscriber.

Additionally, the [pg_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-replication-slots.html) view shows information about the current replication slots on the publisher, including their size.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

It's important to keep an eye on replication lag, which indicates how far behind the subscriber is from the publisher. A significant replication lag could mean that the subscriber isn't receiving updates in a timely manner, which could lead to data inconsistencies.

## Neon specifics

This section outlines information about logical replication specific to Neon, including known limitations.

### Enabling logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Once you enable logical replication in Neon, the setting cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

In Neon, logical replication is enabled from the console, by following these steps:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Replication**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level 
-----------
logical
```

### Logical replication and autosuspend

By default, Neon's [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) feature suspends a compute after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. In a logical replication setup, Neon does not autosuspend a compute instance that has an active connection from a logical replication subscriber. In other words, a compute instance with an active subscriber remains active at all times.

### Replication roles

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege. Roles created via SQL do not have this privilege, and the `REPLICATION` privilege cannot be granted.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a replication role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can verify that your role has the `REPLICATION` privilege by running the follow query:

```sql
SELECT rolname, rolreplication 
FROM pg_roles 
WHERE rolname = '<role_name>';
```

### Subscriber access

A subscriber must be able to access the Neon database that is acting as a publisher. In Neon, no action is required unless you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon.

If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature:

1. Determine the IP address or addresses of the subscriber.
2. In your Neon project, add the IPs to your **IP Allow** list, which you can find in your project's settings. For instructions, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

### Decoder plugins

Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` replication output decoder plugins.

- `pgoutput`: This is the default logical replication output plugin for Postgres. Specifically, it's part of the Postgres built-in logical replication system, designed to read changes from the database's write-ahead log (WAL) and output them in a format suitable for logical replication. 
- `wal2json`: This is also a logical replication output plugin for Postgres, but it differs from `pgoutput` in that it converts WAL data into `JSON` format. This makes it useful for integrating Postgres with systems and applications that work with `JSON` data. For usage information, see [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json).

### Dedicated replication slots

Some data services and platforms require dedicated replication slots. You can create a dedicated replication slot using the standard PostgreSQL syntax. As mentioned above, Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` replication output decoder plugins.

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'wal2json');
```

### Publisher settings

The `max_wal_senders` and `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter settings on Neon are set to `10`.

```text
max_wal_senders = 10
max_replication_slots = 10
```

- The `max_wal_senders` parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender processes that are responsible for streaming WAL data to subscribers. In most cases, you should have one WAL sender process for each subscriber or replication slot to ensure efficient and consistent data replication. 
- The `max_replication_slots` defines the maximum number of replication slots which are used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

If you require different values for these parameters, please contact Neon support.

### Unused replication slots

To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes an _inactive_ replication slot if you have other _active_ replication slots**. Removal occurs after 75 minutes. 

If you have only one replication slot, and that slot becomes inactive, it is not removed due to inactivity because a single replication slot does not bloat storage. If you find that your single replication slot has been removed, please contact [Neon Support](/docs/introduction/support).

#### What causes a replication slot to become inactive? 

An inactive replication slot is one that doesn't acknowledge `flush_lsn` progress for an extended period. This is the same `flush_lsn` value found in the `pg_stat_replication` view in your Neon database.

An _inactive_ replication slot is often the result of a _dead subscriber_, where the replication slot is not dropped after a subscriber is deactivated or becomes unavailable. An inactive replication slot can also result from a replication delay configured on the subscriber. For example, some subscribers allow you to configure the replication frequency or set a replication delay to minimize usage.

#### How to avoid removal of inactive replication slots

To avoid having "inactive" replication slots removed, ensure that your subscriber reports `flush_lsn` progress regularly and that your replication connection doesn't disappear for more than 75 minutes. If the 75-minute limit is not sufficient for your replication setup, please contact [Neon Support](/docs/introduction/support) to discuss a limit extension.

If using Debezium, ensure that [flush.lsn.source](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-property-flush-lsn-source) is set to `true` to allow WAL logs on the source to be cleared. For other subscriber platforms, check for an equivalent setting to make sure it's configured to acknowledge progress on the subscriber.

#### What to do if your replication slot is removed

If you find that a replication slot was removed and you need to add it back, please see [Create a replication slot](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#create-a-replication-slot) for instructions or refer to the replication slot creation instructions for your subscriber.

### Known limitations

Neon is working toward removing the following limitations in future releases:

- Only your default Neon Postgres role and roles created via the Neon Console, CLI, or API have the `REPLICATION` privilege. This privilege cannot be granted to other roles. You can expect this limitation to be lifted in a future release. Roles created via SQL do not have the `REPLICATION` privilege, and this privilege cannot be granted.
- `max_slot_wal_keep_size` is set to 1 GB, limiting the maximum size of WAL files that replication slots are allowed to retain in the `pg_wal` directory. This is a temporary limit that will be removed in a future release. The limit avoids an accumulation of WAL data at the publisher due to a lagging subscriber, which could cause a slow compute start.
- To avoid storage bloat, Neon automatically removes an _inactive_ replication slot if you have other _active_ replication slots. See [Unused replication slots](#unused-replication-slots).

  resources on demand

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute endpoint in response to the current workload, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This guide demonstrates how to enable autoscaling in your Neon project and how to [visualize](#monitor-autoscaling) your usage.

_Autoscaling_ is a paid plan feature. Users on paid plans can enable autoscaling for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute endpoint. Autoscaling is supported with both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints enable Neon's [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) feature.

## Enable autoscaling for a new project

Enabling autoscaling when you create a project allows you to set autoscaling default settings for all compute endpoints created in your project. You can adjust autoscaling settings for individual compute endpoints afterward, but setting defaults when creating a project saves you from having to configure the settings for each compute endpoint later on.

To enable autoscaling when you first create your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region.
4. Under **Compute size**, use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling_project_creation.png)

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the autosuspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>

6. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute endpoint is created with the specified settings. All future compute endpoints that you create will use this setting.

## Enable autoscaling for an existing project

Configuring autoscaling for an existing project sets the project's default, which is applied to all compute endpoints created from that point forward. Existing compute endpoints are unaffected. You can adjust autoscaling default or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure autoscaling default settings for an existing project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Compute** and click **Change**.
1. Under **Compute size**, use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling_existing_project.png)

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the autosuspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>

6. Click **Save**.

## Enable autoscaling for a compute endpoint

Users on paid plans can edit an individual compute endpoint to alter the compute endpoint configuration, which includes autoscaling.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click on the compute endpoint you want to edit.
![Edit compute endpoint menu](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit.png)
1. Under **Compute size**, use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling edit settings](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit_settings.png)

    Neon scales the compute size up and down within the specified range to meet workload demand. Autoscaling currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 8 vCPUs. One vCPU has 4 GB of RAM, 2 vCPUs have 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPUs.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the autosuspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>
1. Click **Save**.

## Monitor autoscaling

From the Neon Console, you can view how your vCPU and RAM usage scales over time (last hour, day, and week). From the **Branches** page, open the branch you want to inspect, then open the **Edit** modal for its compute endpoint.

![autoscaling graph example](/docs/guides/autoscaling_graphs_sample.png "no-border")

Some key points about this Autoscaling view:

- Allocation refers to the vCPU and memory size provisioned to handle current demand; autoscaling automatically adjusts this allocation, increasing or decreasing the allocated vCPU and memory size in a step-wise fashion as demand fluctuates, within your minimum and maximum limits.
- Your minimum and maximum limits are shown as solid horizontal lines. This represents the allocation boundary: the size of your allocated vCPU/memory stays within this range so long as your compute endpoint remains active. It scales to zero after the defined period of inactivity.
- A re-activated compute endpoint scales up immediately to your minimum allocation, ensuring adequate performance for your anticipated demand.

Place your cursor anywhere in the graph to get more usage detail about that particular point in time.

![autoscaling graph detail](/docs/guides/autoscaling_graph_detail.png "no-border")

<Admonition type="note">
To refresh the graph, close the **Edit compute endpoint** drawer and reopen it.
</Admonition>

See below for some rules of thumb on actions you might want to take based on trends you see in this view.

### Start with a good minimum

Ideally, for smaller datasets, you want to keep as much of your dataset in memory (RAM) as possible. This improves performance by minimizing I/O operations. We recommend setting a large enough minimum limit to fit your full dataset in memory. For larger datasets and more sizing advice, see [how to size your compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

### Setting your maximum

If your autoscaling graphs show regular spikes that hit your maximum setting, consider increasing your maximum. However, because these spikes plateau at the maximum setting, it can be difficult to determine your actual demand.

Another approach is to set a higher threshold than you need and monitor usage spikes to get a sense of where your typical maximum demand reaches; you can then throttle the maximum setting down closer to anticipated/historical demand. Either way, with autoscaling you only pay for what you use; a higher setting does not translate to higher costs unless the demand is there to increase usage.

### The neon_utils extension

Another tool for understanding usage, the `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function that helps you monitor how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).

Neon's [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) feature controls when a Neon compute endpoint transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity. For example, if your autosuspend setting is 5 minutes, your compute will "scale to zero" after it's been inactive for 5 minutes. Neon's paid plans allow you to configure this time period to keep your compute active for longer, suspend it more quickly, or disable autosuspension entirely, depending on your requirements. 

This guide demonstrates how to configure the autosuspend setting for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute endpoint.

### Autosuspend limits

The autosuspend limits differ by [Neon plan](/docs/introduction/plans). The limits for each plan are outlined below. The initial default setting for all plans is 5 minutes.


| Plan       | Autosuspend delay                | Can be disabled? |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Free Tier  | 5 minutes                        |                  |
| Launch     | 5 minutes to 7 days              | &check;          |
| Scale      | 1 minute to 7 days               | &check;          |
| Enterprise | Fully configurable               | &check;          |


### Configure the autosuspend setting for a new project

Configuring the autosuspend setting for a new project sets the project's default, which is applied to all computes created from that point forward. You can adjust this autosuspend default at any time, or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure the autosuspend default setting when you first create your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
1. Specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region.
1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** disables autosuspend, meaning the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute endpoint is created with the specified setting.

### Configure the autosuspend setting for an existing project

Configuring the autosuspend setting for an existing project sets the project's default, which is applied to all compute endpoints created from that point forward. Existing compute endpoints are unaffected. You can adjust the autosuspend default or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure the autosuspend default for an existing project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Compute** and click **Change**.
1. Select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** disables autosuspend, meaning the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.

## Configure autosuspend for a compute endpoint

To configure the autosuspend setting for an individual compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
![Edit compute endpoint menu](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit.png)
1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period. The maximum setting is 7 days. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** means the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure **Compute size** settings for your compute endpoint at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.

## Monitor autosuspend

You can monitor autosuspend on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute reports either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

![Compute endpoint status](/docs/connect/compute_endpoint_state.png)

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="info">
The Neon API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
</Admonition>

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it transitions from an **Idle** to an **Active** state.

With Neon's branch restore capability, you can easily restore a branch to an earlier state in its own or another branch's history. You can also use Time Travel Assist to connect to a specific point in your history retention window, where you can run read-only queries to pinpoint the exact moment you need to restore to.

## How branch restore works

### Restore from history

The restore operation lets you revert the state of a selected branch to an earlier point in time in its own or another branch's history, using time and date or Log Sequence Number (LSN). For example, you can revert to a state just before a data loss occurred.

![branch restore to timestamp](/docs/guides/branch-restore_feature.png)

The default history retention for a Neon project differs by plan. You can revert a branch to any time within your configured [retention window](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention), down to the millisecond.

A few key points to keep in mind about the restore operation:

- [Restore backups are created automatically in case you make a mistake](#automatic-backups)
- [Current data is overwritten](#overwrite-not-a-merge)
- [All databases on a branch are restored](#changes-apply-to-all-databases)
- [Connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted](#connections-temporarily-interrupted)

#### Automatic backups

In case you need to rollback a restore, Neon preserves the branch's final state before the restore operation in an automatically created backup branch, which takes the following format:

```md
{branch_name}_old_{head_timestamp}
```

You can use this backup to rollback the restore operation if necessary. The backup branches are listed on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console among your other branches.

This backup becomes the parent of your original branch, which makes rolling back the restore operation simple: [Reset from parent](/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent).

![Backup branch as parent to original](/docs/guides/branch_restore_backup.png)

#### Overwrite, not a merge

It is important to understand that whenever you restore a branch, you are performing a _complete_ overwrite, not a merge or refresh. Everything on your current branch, data and schema, is replaced with the contents from the historical source. All data changes from the selected restore point onwards are excluded from the branch.

#### Changes apply to all databases

A reminder that in Neon's [object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview), a branch can include any number of databases. Keep this in mind when restoring branches. For example, let's say you want to restore lost data in a given database. If you restore your branch to an earlier point in time before the data loss occurred, the operation applies to _all_ databases on the branch, not just the one you are troubleshooting. You can expect the restore operation to last a few seconds.

In general, Neon recommends that you avoid creating too many databases in a single Neon project. If you have multiple, distinct applications, each one deserves its own Neon project. A good rule of thumb: use one Neon project per source code repository.

#### Connections temporarily interrupted

Existing connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted during the restore operation. However, your connection details do not change. Applications can automatically re-establish their database connections as soon as the restore operation is finished.

#### Technical details

Neon is open source and built in public, so if you are interested in understanding the technical implementation of a branch restore operation, see the details below.

<details>
<summary>View technical details</summary>

Similar to the manual restore operation using the Neon Console and API described [here](/docs/guides/branching-pitr), the Restore operation performs a similar set of actions, but automatically:

1. On initiating a restore action, Neon builds a new point-in-time branch by matching your selected timestamp to the corresponding LSN of the relevant entries in the shared WAL record.
1. The compute endpoint for your initial branch is moved to this new branch so that your connection string remains stable.
1. We rename your new branch to the exact name as your initial branch, so the effect is seamless; it looks and acts like the same branch.
1. Your initial branch, which now has no compute attached to it, is renamed to _branch_name_old_head_timestamp_ to keep the pre-restore branch available should you need to roll back. Note that the initial branch was the parent for your new branch, and this is reflected when you look at your branch details.

</details>

### Time Travel Assist

To help troubleshoot your data's history, you can use Time Travel Assist to connect to any selected point in time within your history retention window and then run queries against that connection. It's a good idea to run this kind of query to make sure you've targeted the correct restore point before you restore a branch.

The restore operation and Time Travel Assist are meant to work together. When you select a branch and timestamp, you can either use that selection as your restore point or as the point in time connection to query against.

![Time travel assist](/docs/guides/branch_time_travel.png)

#### Ephemeral endpoints

Time travel assist leverages Neon's instant branching capability to create a temporary branch and compute endpoint at the selected point in time, which is automatically removed once you are done querying against this point-in-time connection. The compute endpoints are ephemeral: they are not listed on the **Branches** page or in a CLI or API list branches request.

However, you can see the history of operations related to the creation and deletion of the ephemeral branch on the **Operations** page:

- start_compute
- create_branch
- delete_timeline
- suspend_compute

#### How long do ephemeral endpoints remain active

The ephemeral endpoints are created according to your configured [default compute size](/docs/manage/projects#reset-the-default-compute-size). An ephemeral endpoint remains active for as long as you keep running queries against it. After 10 seconds of inactivity, the timeline is deleted and the endpoint is removed.

## How to use branch restore

You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API to restore branches.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

### Restoring from history

Use the **Restore** page to restore a branch to an earlier timestamp in its history.

First, select the **Branch to restore**. This is the target branch for the restore operation.

![branch restore to timestamp](/docs/guides/branch_restore_timestamp.png)

#### To restore a branch from its own history:

1. Make sure the **From history** tab is selected. 
1. Choose your timestamp or switch to LSN.
 1. Click **Next**.

    A confirmation window opens giving you details about the pending restore operation. Review these details to make sure you've made the correct selections.

1. Click **Restore** to complete the operation.

#### To restore from another branch:

 1. Switch to the **From another branch** tab.
 1. Select the source branch that that you want to restore data from.
 1. By default, the operation pulls the latest data from the source branch. If you want to pull from an earlier point in time, disable **Restore from latest data (head)**.

     The timestamp selector will appear.

 1. Choose your timestamp or switch to the LSN input.
 1. Click **Next**, confirm the details of the operation, then click **Restore** to complete.

All databases on the selected branch are instantly updated with the data and schema from the chosen point in time. From the **Branches** page, you can now see a backup branch was created with the state of the branch at the restore point in time.

![branch restore backup branch](/docs/guides/branch_restore_backup_file.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Using the CLI, you can restore a branch to an earlier point in its history or another branch's history using the following command:

``` bash shouldWrap
neonctl branches restore <target id|name> <source id|name @ timestamp|lsn>
```

In the `target id|name` field, specify the ID or name of the branch you want to restore. In the `source id|name timestamp|lsn` field, specify the source branch you want to restore from (mandatory), along with the point-in-time identifier (optional), which can be either an ISO 8601-formatted timestamp or the LSN. If you omit the point-in-time identifier, the operation defaults to the latest data (HEAD) for the source branch. Concatenate the source identifier and time identifier with `@`: for example, `dev/jordan@2023-12-12T12:00:00Z`.

#### Restore a branch to its own history

If you want to restore a branch to an earlier point in time, use the syntax `^self` in the `<source id|name>` field. For example:

```bash shouldWrap
neonctl branches restore dev/alex ^self@2024-01-01T00:00:00Z --preserve-under-name alex_old
```

This command resets the target branch `dev/alex` to its state at the start of 2024, saving the latest data in a backup called `alex_old` using the `preserve-under-name` parameter (mandatory when resetting to self).

#### Restore from parent

If you want to restore a target branch from its parent, you can use the special syntax `^parent` in the `<source id|name>` field. For example:

``` bash
neonctl branches restore dev/alex ^parent
```

This command will restore the target branch `dev/alex` to the latest data (HEAD) of its parent branch.

#### Restore to another branch's history

Here is an example of a command that restores a target branch to an earlier point in time of another branch's history:

```bash shouldWrap
neonctl branches restore dev/alex dev/jordan@0/12345
```

This command will restore the target branch `dev/alex` to an earlier point in time from the source branch `dev/jordan`, using the LSN `0/12345` to specify the point in time. If you left out the point-in-time identifier, the command would default to the latest data (HEAD) for the source branch `dev/jordan`.

For full CLI documentation for `branches restore`, see [branches restore](/docs/reference/cli-branches#restore).
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
To restore a branch using the API, use the endpoint:

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id_to_restore}/restore
```

This endpoint lets you restore a branch using the following request parameters:

| Parameter              | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **preserve_under_name**| `string` | No       | If specified, a backup is created: the latest version of the branch's state is preserved under a new branch using the specified name.<br /><br />**Note:** This field is required if:<br />- The branch has children. All child branches will be moved to the newly created branch.<br />- You are restoring a branch to its own history (`source_branch_id` equals the branch's own ID).                                                               |

#### Restoring a branch to its own history

In the following example, we are restoring branch `br-twilight-river-31791249` to an earlier point in time, `2024-02-27T00:00:00Z`, with a new backup branch named `backup-before-restore`. Note that the branch id in the `url` matches the value for `source_branch_id`.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \ // [!code word:br-twilight-river-31791249]
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/floral-disk-86322740/branches/br-twilight-river-31791249/restore \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "source_branch_id": "br-twilight-river-31791249",
  "source_timestamp": "2024-02-27T00:00:00Z",
  "preserve_under_name": "backup-before-restore"
}
' | jq
```

### Restoring to the latest data from another branch

In this example, we are restoring a development branch `dev/alex` (branch ID `br-twilight-river-31791249`) to the latest data (head) of its parent branch `br-jolly-star-07007859`. Note that we don't include any time identifier or backup branch name; this is a straight reset of the branch to the head of its parent.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \ // [!code word:br-twilight-river-31791249]
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/floral-disk-86322740/branches/br-twilight-river-31791249/restore \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ // [!code word:br-jolly-star-07007859]
     --data '
{ 
  "source_branch_id": "br-jolly-star-07007859"}
' | jq
```

### Restoring to the earlier state of another branch

In this example, we are restoring branch `dev/jordan` (branch ID `br-damp-smoke-91135977`) to branch `dev/alex` (branch ID `br-twilight-river-31791249`) at the point in time of `Feb 26, 2024 12:00:00.000 AM`.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \ // [!code word:br-damp-smoke-91135977]
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/floral-disk-86322740/branches/br-damp-smoke-91135977/restore \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \ //  [!code word:br-jolly-star-07007859]
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
     --data '
{ 
  "source_branch_id": "br-jolly-star-07007859", 
  "source_timestamp": "2024-02-26T12:00:00Z"
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To make sure you choose the right restore point, we encourage you to use Time Travel Assist _before_ running a restore job, but the backup branch is there if you need it.
If you do need to revert your changes, you can [Reset from parent](/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent) since that is your branch's relationship to the restore point backup.

### Using Time Travel Assist

Here is how to use the Time Travel Assist SQL editor:

1. Select the branch you want to query against, then select a timestamp, the same as you would to [Restore a branch](#restore-a-branch-to-an-earlier-state).

    This makes the selection for Time Travel Assist. Notice the updated fields above the SQL editor show the **branch** and **timestamp** you just selected.
    ![Time travel assist](/docs/guides/time_travel_assist.png)
  
1. Check that you have the right database selected to run your query against. Use the database selector under the SQL editor to switch to a different database for querying against.
1. Write your read-only query in the editor, then click **Query at timestamp** to run the query. You don't have to include time parameters in the query; the query is automatically targeted to your selected timestamp.

If your query is successful, you will see a table of results under the editor.

Depending on your query and the selected timestamp, instead of a table of results, you might see different error messages like:
| Error                | Explanation             |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| If you query a timestamp in the future         | Console request failed with 400 Bad Request: timestamp [timestamp] is in the future, try an older timestamp |
| If you query a timestamp from before your project was created | Console request failed with 400 Bad Request: parent timestamp [timestamp] is earlier than the project creation timestamp [timestamp], try a more recent timestamp |
| If you query from earlier than your history retention window | Console request failed with 400 Bad Request: timestamp [timestamp] recedes your project's history retention window of 168h0m0s, try a more recent timestamp |

Adjust your selected timestamp accordingly.

## Billing considerations

There are minimal impacts to billing from the branch restore and Time Travel Assist features.

### Restore from history (billing)

Restoring a branch to its own history adds to your number of branches &#8212; due to the restore_backup branch &#8212; but since they do not have any compute endpoint attached, they do not add to any consumption costs.

### Time travel Assist (billing)

The ephemeral endpoints used to run your Time Travel Assist queries do contribute to your consumption usage totals for the billing period, like any other active endpoint that consumes resources.

A couple of details to note:

- The endpoints are shortlived. They are suspended 10 seconds after you stop querying.
- Since these endpoints are created according to your default compute size (which applies to all new branch computes you create),  you may want to reduce this default if you're performing a lot of time-travel queries for troubleshooting.

## Limitations

- You cannot delete a backup branch without first removing the child branch.
- Once you restore a branch, [Reset from parent](/docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent) restores from the restore backup branch, not the original parent.

  For example, let's say you have a `main` branch with a child development branch `dev/alex`. You are working on `dev/alex` and decide to restore to an earlier point in time to fix something during development. At this point, `dev/alex`'s parent switches from `main` to the backup `dev/alex_old_timestamp`. A day later, you want to refresh `dev/alex` with the latest data from `main`. You can't use **Reset from parent**, since the backup is now the parent. Instead, use **Branch Restore** and select the original parent `main` as the source. 


# Branching â Testing queries

Complex queries that modify data or alter schemas have the potential to be destructive. It is advisable to test these types of queries before running them in production. On other database systems, testing potentially destructive queries can be time and resource intensive. For example, testing may involve setting up a separate database instance and replicating data. With Neon, you can instantly create a database branch with a full copy-on-write clone of your production data in just a few clicks. When you finish testing, you can remove the branch just as easily.

This guide walks you through creating a branch of your production data, testing a potentially destructive query, and deleting the branch when you are finished.

1. [Create a test branch](#create-a-test-branch)
3. [Test your query](#test-your-query)
4. [Delete the test branch](#delete-the-test-branch)

For the purpose of this guide, let's assume you have a database in Neon with the following table and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Post (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    author_name VARCHAR(100),
    date_published DATE
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Post (id, title, content, author_name, date_published)
VALUES
(1, 'My first post', 'This is the content of the first post.', 'Alice', '2023-01-01'),
(2, 'My second post', 'This is the content of the second post.', 'Alice', '2023-02-01'),
(3, 'Old post by Bob', 'This is an old post by Bob.', 'Bob', '2020-01-01'),
(4, 'Recent post by Bob', 'This is a recent post by Bob.', 'Bob', '2023-06-01'),
(5, 'Another old post', 'This is another old post.', 'Alice', '2019-06-01');
```

## Create a test branch

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
![Create branch dialog](/docs/manage/create_branch.png)
4. Enter a name for the branch. This guide uses the name `my_test_branch`.
5. Select a parent branch. Select the branch defined as your primary branch.
6. Under **Include data up to**, select the **Current point in time** option to create a branch with the latest available data from the parent branch (the default).
7. Click **Create new branch** to create your branch.

You are directed to the **Branches** page where you are shown the details for your new branch.

You can also create a test branch using the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create) or [Neon API](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch-with-the-api).

<CodeTabs labels={["CLI", "API"]}>

```bash
neonctl branches create --project-id <project-id> --name my_test_branch
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project-id>/branches \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "name": "my_test_branch"
  }
}
' | jq
```

</CodeTabs>

## Test your query

Navigate to the **SQL Editor**, select the test branch, and run your query. For example, perhaps you are deleting blog posts from your database for a certain author published before a certain date, and you want to make sure the query only removes the intended records.

```sql
DELETE FROM Post
WHERE author_name = 'Alice' AND date_published < '2020-01-01';
```

Next, inspect the data to ensure the intended records were deleted, while others remained unaffected. This query allows you to quickly see if the number of records matches your expectations:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Post;
```

Before the `DELETE` query, there were 5 records. If the query ran correctly, this should now show 4.

## Delete the test branch

When you finish testing your query, you can delete the test branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Select the test branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Delete**.
4. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

You can also delete a branch using the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#delete) or [Neon API](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch-with-the-api).

<CodeTabs labels={["CLI", "API"]}>

```bash
neonctl branches delete my_test_branch
```

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch-id> \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon CLI. For other branch-related CLI commands, refer to [Neon CLI commands â branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches). This guide also describes how to use the `--api-key` option to authenticate CLI branching commands from the command line.

The examples show the default `table` output format. The Neon CLI also supports `json` and `yaml` output formats. For example, if you prefer output in `json`, add `--output json` to your Neon CLI command.

## Prerequisites

- The Neon CLI. See [Install the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install) for instructions.
- To run CLI commands, you must either authenticate through your browser or supply an API key using the `--api-key` option. See [Connect with the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## Create a branch with the CLI

The following Neon CLI command creates a branch. If your Neon account has more than one project, you will be required to specify a project ID using the `--project-id` option. To view the CLI documentation for this command, refer to the [Neon CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).
The command response includes the branch ID, the compute endpoint ID, and and the connection URI for connecting to the branch.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can use the `--name` option with a `neonctl branches create` command to specify your own branch name instead of using the name generated by Neon. For example: `neonctl branches create --name mybranch`. Also, for any Neon CLI command, you can specify `--output json` to change the command output from the default table format to JSON format.

```bash
neonctl branches create

## Branching automation with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI enables easy automation of branching operations for integration into your workflows or toolchains. To facilitate authentication to Neon when running a CLI command, the Neon CLI allows you to use an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

To use an API key, you can store it in an environment variable on your system. This prevents the key from being hardcoded into your automation scripts or exposed in another way. For example, you can add the following line to your shell's profile file (`.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for bash shell):

```bash
export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
```

After exporting your key, source the profile file (source `~/.bashrc` or source `~/.bash_profile`), or start a new terminal session.

You do not need to specify the variable name explicitly when using a Neon CLI command. A Neon CLI command looks for a `NEON_API_KEY` variable setting by default.

This API key configuration ensures that the API key is kept secure while still providing a way to authenticate your CLI commands. Remember, you should handle your API key with the same level of security as your other credentials.

## Restoring a branch to its own or another branch's history

Using the CLI, you can restore a branch to an earlier point in its history or another branch's history using the following command:

``` bash shouldWrap
neonctl branches restore <target id|name> <source id|name @ timestamp|lsn>
```

For full details about the different restore options available with this command, see [Restoring using the CLI](/docs/guides/branch-restore#how-to-use-branch-restore).

title: Branching with the Neon API
subtitle: Learn how to create and delete branches with the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-19T18:57:12.556Z'
---
The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may only show some of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` program specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](../manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

## Create a branch with the API

The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch).

```http
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:

<Admonition type="note">
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's primary branch, and a compute endpoint is not created.
</Admonition>

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "type": "read_write"
    }
  ],
  "branch": {
    "parent_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433"
  }
}' | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Project settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API. It is a generated value that looks something like this: `autumn-disk-484331`.
- The `endpoints` attribute creates a compute endpoint, which is required to connect to the branch. Neon supports `read_write` and `read_only` endpoint types. A branch can be created with or without a compute endpoint. You can specify `read_only` to create a [read replica](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide).
- The `branch` attribute specifies the parent branch.
- The `parent_id` can be obtained by listing the branches for your project. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api). The `parent_id` is the `id` of the branch you are branching from. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. You can branch from your Neon project's primary branch or a non-primary branch.

The response includes information about the branch, the branch's compute endpoint, and the `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations that were initiated.

}
```

## List branches with the API

The following Neon API method lists branches for the specified project. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches).

```http
GET /projects/{project_id}/branches
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/branches' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Project settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API.

The response lists the project's primary branch and any child branches. The name of the primary branch in this example is `main`.

Response:

```json

      "updated_at": "2022-12-07T00:45:05Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Delete a branch with the API

The following Neon API method deletes the specified branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectbranch).

```http
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/branches/br-dawn-scene-747675' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Project settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API.
- The `branch_id` can be found by listing the branches for your project. The `<branch_id>` is the `id` of a branch. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api).

The response shows information about the branch being deleted and the `suspend_compute` and `delete_timeline` operations that were initiated.

```json
{
  "branch": {
    "id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
    "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
    "parent_id": "br-shy-meadow-151383",
    "parent_lsn": "0/1953508",
    "name": "br-flat-darkness-194551",
    "current_state": "ready",
    "created_at": "2022-12-08T20:01:31Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-12-08T20:01:31Z"
  },
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "c7ee9bea-c984-41ac-8672-9848714104bc",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "suspend_compute",
      "status": "running",
      "failures_count": 0,

      "updated_at": "2022-12-06T01:12:10Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can verify that a branch is deleted by listing the branches for your project. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api). The deleted branch should no longer be listed.

## Restoring a branch using the API

To revert changes or recover lost data, you can use the branch restore endpoint in the Neon API.

```bash
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id_to_restore}/restore
```

For details on how to use this endpoint to restore a branch to its own or another branch's history, restore a branch to the head of its parent, and other restore options, see [Branch Restore using the API](/docs/guides/branch-restore#how-to-use-branch-restore).

# Promote a branch with the Neon API

---
title: Promote a branch
subtitle: Learn how to promote a branch to the primary branch of your Neon project using
  the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-19T18:57:12.554Z'
---

This guide describes how to create a new branch and promote it to the primary branch of your Neon project in the context of a data recovery scenario. It also describes how to move the compute endpoint from your existing primary branch to the new branch to avoid having to reconfigure your application's database connection details.

## What is a primary branch?

Each Neon project has a primary branch. In the Neon Console, your primary branch is identified on the **Branches** page by a `PRIMARY` tag. You can designate any branch as the primary branch. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch, which is typically the branch used in production.

- For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is always available.
- For users on paid plans, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. Neon has a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect your account from unintended usage.

## Why promote a branch to primary?

A common usage scenario involving promoting a branch to primary is data recovery. For example, a data loss occurs on the current primary branch. To recover the lost data, you create a point-in-time branch with data that existed before the data loss occurred. To avoid modifying your application's database connection configuration, you move the compute endpoint from the current primary branch to the new branch and make that branch your primary.

The procedure described below creates a new branch and promotes it to the primary branch of your project by performing the following steps:

1. [Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint](#creating-a-new-point-in-time-branch-without-a-compute-endpoint)
2. [Moving the compute endpoint from your current primary branch to the new branch](#move-the-compute-endpoint-from-your-current-primary-branch-to-the-new-branch)
3. [Renaming the old primary branch](#rename-the-old-primary-branch)
4. [Renaming the new branch to the name of the old primary branch](#rename-the-new-branch-to-the-name-of-the-old-primary-branch)
5. [Promoting the new branch to primary](#promote-the-new-branch-to-primary)

## Prerequisites

The following information is required to perform the procedure:

- A Neon API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- The `project_id` for your Neon project. You can obtain a `project_id` using the [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) method, or you can find it on your project's **Project settings** page in the Neon Console.
- The `branch_id` of the current primary branch. You can obtain a `branch_id` using the [List branches](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches) method, or you can find it on the your project's **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A `branch_id` has a `br-` prefix.
- The `endpoint_id` of the compute endpoint associated with the current primary branch. You can obtain an `endpoint_id` using the [List endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method, or you can find it on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. An `endpoint_id` has an `ep-` prefix.

## Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint

The [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) request shown below creates a point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint. The `project_id` is a required parameter. To create a point-in-time branch, specify a `parent_timestamp` value in the `branch` object. The `parent_timestamp` value must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). For more information about point-in-time restore, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore (PITR)](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

The `project_id` value used in the example below is `young-silence-08999984`. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key. The branch is given the  name `recovery_branch`. You will change the name in a later step.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/branches \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "parent_timestamp": "2023-09-02T10:00:00Z",
    "name": "recovery_branch"
  }
}
'
```

The response body includes the `id` of your new branch. You will need this value (`br-solitary-hat-85369851`) to move the compute endpoint in the next step.

<Admonition type="note">
Logical replication in Neon is currently in Beta. We welcome your feedback to help improve this feature. You can provide feedback via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or by reaching out to us on [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ).
</Admonition>

<LRNotice/>

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon database to external destinations, allowing for Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. Stream your data to data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, external Postgres databases, and more.

![Neon logical replication subscribers image](/docs/guides/logical_replication_subscribers.png)

Logical replication in Neon works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.

Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.

To get started, jump into one of our step-by-step [logical replication guides](#logical-replication-guides).

To learn more about Postgres logical replication, see [Learn about logical replication](#learn-about-logical-replication).

<LRNotice/>

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is an open-source data integration platform that moves data from a source to a destination system. Airbyte offers a large library of connectors for various data sources and destinations.

In this guide, you will learn how to define your Neon Postgres database as a data source in Airbyte so that you can stream data to one or more of Airbyte's supported destinations.

## Prerequisites

- An [Airbyte account](https://airbyte.com/)
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)

## Enable logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor):

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Create a replication slot

Airbyte requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.

Airbyte uses the `pgoutput` plugin in Postgres for decoding WAL changes into a logical replication stream. To create a replication slot called `airbyte_slot` that uses the `pgoutput` plugin, run the following command on your database using your replication role:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('airbyte_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

`airbyte_slot` is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide this name when you set up your Airbyte source.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

## Create a publication

Perform the following steps for each table you want to replicate data from:

1. Add the replication identity (the method of distinguishing between rows) for each table you want to replicate:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT;
    ```

    In rare cases, if your tables use data types that support [TOAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) or have very large field values, consider using `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` instead:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

2. Create the Postgres publication. Include all tables you want to replicate as part of the publication:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION airbyte_publication FOR TABLE <tbl1, tbl2, tbl3>;
    ```

    The publication name is customizable. Refer to the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.

<Admonition type="note">
The Airbyte UI currently allows selecting any tables for Change Data Capture (CDC). If a table is selected that is not part of the publication, it will not be replicated even though it is selected. If a table is part of the publication but does not have a replication identity, the replication identity will be created automatically on the first run if the Postgres role you use with Airbyte has the necessary permissions.
</Admonition>

## Create a Postgres source in Airbyte

1. From your Airbyte Cloud account, select **Sources** from the left navigation bar, search for **Postgres**, and then create a new Postgres source.
2. Enter the connection details for your Neon database. You can get these details from your Neon connection string, which you'll find in the **Connection Details** widget on the **Dashboard** of your Neon project.
    For example, given a connection string like this:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
    ```

    Enter the details in the Airbyte **Create a source** dialog as shown below. Your values will differ.

    - **Host**: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
    - **Port**: 5432
    - **Database Name**: dbname
    - **Username**: alex
    - **Password**: AbC123dEf

    ![Airbyte Create a source](/docs/guides/airbyte_create_source.png)

3. Under **Optional fields**, list the schemas you want to sync. Schema names are case-sensitive, and multiple schemas may be specified. By default, `public` is the only selected schema.
4. Select an SSL mode. You will most frequently choose `require` or `verify-ca`. Both of these options always require encryption. The `verify-ca` mode requires a certificate. Refer to [Connect securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely) for information about the location of certificate files you can use with Neon.
5. Under **Advanced**:

    - Select **Logical Replication (CDC)** from available replication methods.
    - In the **Replication Slot** field, enter the name of the replication slot you created previously: `airbyte_slot`.
    - In the **Publication** field, enter the name of the publication you created previously: `airbyte_publication`.
    ![Airbyte advanced fields](/docs/guides/airbyte_cdc_advanced_fields.png)

## Allow inbound traffic

If you are on Airbyte Cloud, and you are using Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP address that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Airbyte's IP addresses. You can find a list of IPs that need to be allowlisted in the [Airbyte Security docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/operating-airbyte/security). For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Complete the source setup

To complete your source setup, click **Set up source** in the Airbyte UI. Airbyte will test the connection to your database. Once this succeeds, you've successfully configured an Airbyte Postgres source for your Neon database.

## Configure a destination

To complete your data integration setup, you can now add one of Airbyte's many supported destinations, such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Kafka, to name a few. After configuring a destination, you'll need to set up a connection between your Neon source database and your chosen destination. Refer to the Airbyte documentation for instructions:

- [Add a destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/getting-started/add-a-destination)
- [Set up a connection](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/getting-started/set-up-a-connection)

<LRNotice/>

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.

[Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/) is an automated data movement platform that helps you centralize data from disparate sources, which you can then manage directly from your browser. Fivetran extracts your data and loads it into your data destination.

In this guide, you will learn how to define a Neon Postgres database as a data source in Fivetran so that you can replicate data to one or more of Fivetran's supported destinations.

## Prerequisites

- A [Fivetran account](https://fivetran.com/)
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)

## Enable logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be temporarily dropped before automatically reconnecting.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor):

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a Postgres role for replication

We recommend using a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**.

The role is now created and you are provided with the password for the role, which you can show, copy, or download.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole).

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Create a publication

Create the Postgres publication. Include all tables you want to replicate as part of the publication:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION fivetran_pub FOR TABLE <tbl1, tbl2, tbl3>;
```

The publication name is customizable. Refer to the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.

## Create a replication slot

Fivetran requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.

Fivetran uses the `pgoutput` plugin in Postgres for decoding WAL changes into a logical replication stream. To create a replication slot called `fivetran_slot` that uses the `pgoutput` plugin, run the following command on your database using your replication role:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('fivetran_pgoutput_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The name assigned to the replication slot is `fivetran_pgoutput_slot`. You will need to provide this name when you set up your Fivetran source.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

## Create a Postgres source in Fivetran

1. Log in to your [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/) account.
1. On the **Select your datasource** page, search for the **PostgreSQL** source and click **Set up**.
1. In your connector setup form, enter a value for **Destination Schema Prefix**. This prefix applies to each replicated schema and cannot be changed once your connector is created. In this example, we'll use `neon` as the prefix.
1. Enter the connection details for your Neon database. You can get these details from your Neon connection string, which you'll find in the **Connection Details** widget on the **Dashboard** of your Neon project.
    For example, let's say this is your connection string:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
    ```

    From this string, the values in the Fivetran **Create a source** dialog would show as below. Your actual values will differ, with the exception of the port number.

    - **Host**: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
    - **Port**: 5432
    - **Username**: alex
    - **Password**: AbC123dEf
    - **Database Name**: dbname

1. For **Connection Method**, select **Logical replication of the WAL using the pgoutput plugin** and enter values for the **Replication Slot** and **Publication Name**. You deifned these values earlier (`fivetran_pgoutput_slot` and `fivetran_pub`, respectively).

    ![Fivetran connector setup](/docs/guides/fivetran_connector_setup.png)

1. If you are using Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, add Fivetran's IPs to your allowlist in Neon.

    ![Fivetran IP addresses](/docs/guides/fivetran_ips.png)

    For instructions, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow). You'll need to do this before you can validate your connection in the next step. If you are not using Neon's **IP Allow** feature, you can skip this step.

1. Click **Save & Test**. Fivetran tests and validates the connection to your database. Upon successful completion of the setup tests, you can sync your data using Fivetran.

    During the test, Fivetran asks you to confirm the certificate chain by selecting the certificate to use as the trust anchor. Select the `CN=ISRG Root X1, 0=Internet Security Research Group, C=US` option. This certificate is valid unitl until 2035-06-04.

    When the connection test is completed, you should see an **All connection tests passed!** message in Fivetran, as shown below:

    ![Fivetran all connections passed message](/docs/guides/fivetran_connection_test.png)

1. Click **Continue**.
1. On the **Select Data to Sync** page, review the connector schema and select any columns you want to block or hash.

    ![Fivetran select data to sync page](/docs/guides/fivetran_select_data.png)

1. Click **Save & Continue**.

1. On the **How would you like to handle changes?** page, specify how you would like to handle future schema changes. For this example, we'll select **We will allow all new schemas, tables and columns**. Choose the option that best fits your organization's requirements.

    ![Fivetran how to handle changes](/docs/guides/fivetran_changes.png)

1. Click **Continue**. Your data is now ready to sync.

    ![Fivetran data is ready to sync page](/docs/guides/fivetran_ready_to_sync.png)

1. Click **Start Initial Sync** to enable syncing.

<LRNotice/>

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.

Confluent Cloud is a fully managed, cloud-native real-time data streaming service, built on Apache Kafka. It allows you to stream data from various sources, including Postgres, and build apps that consume messages from an Apache Kafka cluster.

In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from a Neon Postgres database to a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud. You will use the [PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-debezium.html) to read Change Data Capture (CDC) events from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) of your Neon database in real-time. The connector will write events to a Kafka stream and auto-generate a Kafka topic. The connector performs an initial snapshot of the table and then streams any future change events.

<Admonition type="note">
Confluent Cloud Connectors can be set up using the [Confluent Cloud UI](https://confluent.cloud/home) or the [Confluent command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html). This guide uses the Confluent Cloud UI.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud) account
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)

## Enable logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, which means that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor):

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a publication

In this example, we'll create a publication for a `users` table in the `public` schema of your Neon database.

1. Create the `users` table in your Neon database. You can do this via the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or by connecting to your Neon database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

2. Create a publication for the `users` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
    ```

This command creates a publication, named `users_publication`, which will include all changes to the `users` table in your replication stream.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Create a replication slot

The Debezium connector requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.

To create a replication slot called `debezium`, run the following command on your database using your replication role:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('debezium', 'pgoutput');
```

- `debezium` is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide the slot name when you set up your source connector in Confluent.
- `pgoutput` is the logical decoder plugin used in this example. Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` decoder plugins.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

## Set up a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud

1. Sign in to Confluent Cloud at [https://confluent.cloud](https://confluent.cloud).
2. Click **Add cluster**.
3. On the **Create cluster** page, for the **Basic cluster**, select **Begin configuration**.
4. On the **Region/zones** page, choose a cloud provider, a region, and select a single availability zone.
5. Select **Continue**.
6. Specify your payment details. You can select **Skip payment** for now if you're just trying out the setup.
7. Specify a cluster name, review the configuration and cost information, and select **Launch cluster**. In this example, we use `cluster_neon` as the cluster name.
    It may take a few minutes to provision your cluster. After the cluster has been provisioned, the **Cluster Overview** page displays.

## Set up a source connector

To set up a Postgres CDC source connector for Confluent Cloud:

1. On the **Cluster Overview** page, under **Set up connector**, select **Get started**.
2. On the **Connector Plugins** page, enter `Postgres` into the search field.
3. Select the **Postgres CDC Source** connector. This is the [PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-debezium.html). This connector will take a snapshot of the existing data and then monitor and record all subsequent row-level changes to that data.

4. On the **Add Postgres CDC Source connector** page:

    - Select the type of access you want to grant the connector. For the purpose of this guide, we'll select **Global access**, but if you are configuring a production pipeline, Confluent recommends **Granular access**.
    - Click the **Generate API key & download** button to generate an API key and secret that your connector can use to communicate with your Kafka cluster. Your applications will need this API key and secret to make requests to your Kafka cluster. Store the API key and secret somewhere safe. This is the only time youâll see the secret.

    Click **Continue**.

5. On the **Add Postgres CDC Source connector** page:

    - Add the connection details for your Neon database. You can obtain the required details from your Neon connection string, which you can find in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Your connection string will look something like this:

        ```text
        postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
        ```

        Enter the details for **your connection string** into the source connector fields. Based on the sample connection string above, the values would be specified as shown below. Your values will differ.

        - **Database name**: `dbname`
        - **Database server name**: `neon_server` (This is a user-specified value that will represent the logical name of your Postgres server. Confluent uses this name as a namespace in all Kafka topic and schema names. It is also used for Avro schema namespaces if the Avro data format is used. The Kafka topic will be created with the prefix `database.server.name`. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots are allowed.)
        - **SSL mode**: `require`
        - **Database hostname** `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech` (this example shows the portion of a Neon connection string forms the database hostname)
        - **Database port**: `5432` (Neon uses port `5432`)
        - **Database username**: `alex`
        - **Database Password** `AbC123dEf`

    - If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to add the Confluent cluster static IP addresses to your allowlist. For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow). If you do not use Neon's **IP Allow** feature, you can skip this step.

    Click **Continue**.

6. Under **Output Kafka record value format**, select an output format for Kafka record values. The default is `JSON`, so we'll use that format in this guide. Other supported values include `AVRO`, `JSON_SR`, and `PROTOBUF`, which are schema-based message formats. If you use any of these, you must also configure a [Confluent Cloud Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/index.html).

    Expand the **Show advanced configurations** drop-down and set the following values:

    - Under **Advanced configuration**
      - Ensure **Slot name** is set to `debezium`. This is the name of the replication slot you created earlier.
      - Set the **Publication name** to `users_publication`, which is the name of the publication you created earlier.
      - Set **Publication auto-create** mode to `disabled`. You've already created your publication.
    - Under **Database details**, set **Tables included** to `public.users`, which is the name of the Neon database table you are replicating from.

    Click **Continue**.

7. For **Connector sizing**, accept the default for the maximum number of [Tasks](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html#tasks). Tasks can be scaled up at a later time for additional throughput capacity.

    Click **Continue**.

8. Adjust your **Connector name** if desired, and review your **Connector configuration**, which is provided in `JSON` format, as shown below. We'll use the default connector name in this guide.

    ```json
    {
      "connector.class": "PostgresCdcSource",
      "name": "PostgresCdcSourceConnector_0",
      "kafka.auth.mode": "KAFKA_API_KEY",
      "kafka.api.key": "2WY3UABFDN7DDFIV",
      "kafka.api.secret": "****************************************************************",
      "schema.context.name": "default",
      "database.hostname": "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech",
      "database.port": "5432",
      "database.user": "alex",
      "database.password": "************",
      "database.dbname": "dbname",
      "database.server.name": "neon_server",
      "database.sslmode": "require",
      "publication.name": "users_publication",
      "publication.autocreate.mode": "all_tables",
      "snapshot.mode": "initial",
      "tombstones.on.delete": "true",
      "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
      "slot.name": "debezium",
      "poll.interval.ms": "1000",
      "max.batch.size": "1000",
      "event.processing.failure.handling.mode": "fail",
      "heartbeat.interval.ms": "0",
      "provide.transaction.metadata": "false",
      "decimal.handling.mode": "precise",
      "binary.handling.mode": "bytes",
      "time.precision.mode": "adaptive",
      "cleanup.policy": "delete",
      "hstore.handling.mode": "json",
      "interval.handling.mode": "numeric",
      "schema.refresh.mode": "columns_diff",
      "output.data.format": "JSON",
      "after.state.only": "true",
      "output.key.format": "JSON",
      "json.output.decimal.format": "BASE64",
      "tasks.max": "1"
    }
    ```

    Click **Continue** to provision the connector, which may take a few monents to complete.

## Verify your Kafka stream

To verify that events are now being published to a Kafka stream in Confluent:

1. Insert a row into your `users` table from the Neon SQL Editor or a `psql` client connect to your Neon database. For example:

    ```sql
    -- Insert a new user
    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('Zhang', 'zhang@example.com');
    ```

2. In Confluent Cloud, navigate to your cluster (`cluster_neon` in this guide) and select **Topics** > **neon_server.public.users** > **Messages**. Your newly inserted data should appear at the top of the list of messages.

## Next steps

With events now being published to a Kafka stream, you can now set up a connection between Confluent and a supported consumer. This is quite simple using a Confluent Connector. For example, you can stream data to [Databricks](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-databricks-delta-lake-sink/databricks-aws-setup.html#), [Snowflake](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-snowflake-sink.html), or one of the other supported consumers. Refer to the Confluent documentation for connector-specific instructions.

<LRNotice/>

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.

[Materialize](https://materialize.com/) is a data warehouse for operational workloads, purpose-built for low-latency applications. You can use it to process data at speeds and scales not possible in traditional databases, but without the cost, complexity, or development time of most streaming engines.

In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from your Neon Postgres database to Materialize using the Materialize [PostgreSQL source](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/).

## Prerequisites

- A [Materialize account](https://materialize.com/register/)
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)
- Optionally, you can install the [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) command line utility for running commands in both Neon and Materialize. Alternatively, you can run commands from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) and Materialize **SQL Shell**, which require no installation or setup.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

## Enable logical replication

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a publication

After logical replication is enabled in Neon, the next step is to create a publication for the tables that you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. From a `psql` client connected to your Neon database or from the **Neon SQL Editor**, set the [replica identity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-ALTERTABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY) to `FULL` for each table that you want to replicate to Materialize:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE <table1> REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

    `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` ensures that the replication stream includes the previous data of changed rows, in the case of `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. This setting allows Materialize to ingest Postgres data with minimal in-memory state.

2. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate:

    For specific tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION mz_source FOR TABLE <table1>, <table2>;
    ```

    The `mz_source` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables and will later be used to ingest the replication stream.

    Be sure to include only the tables you need. If the publication includes additional tables, Materialize wastes resources on ingesting and then immediately discarding the data from those tables.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Allow inbound traffic

If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Materize IP addresses. If you are currently not limiting IP address access in Neon, you can skip this step.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, run this command to find the static egress IP addresses for the Materialize region you are running in:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mz_egress_ips;
    ```

2. In your Neon project, add the IPs to your **IP Allow** list, which you can find in your project's settings. For instructions, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Create an ingestion cluster

In Materialize, a [cluster](https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/key-concepts/#clusters) is an isolated environment, similar to a virtual warehouse in Snowflake. When you create a cluster, you choose the size of its compute resource allocation based on the work you need the cluster to do, whether ingesting data from a source, computing always-up-to-date query results, serving results to clients, or a combination.

In this case, youâll create 1 new cluster containing 1 medium replica for ingesting source data from your Neon Postgres database.

From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, run the `CREATE CLUSTER` command to create the new cluster:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTER ingest_postgres SIZE = 'medium';
```

Materialize recommends starting with a medium [size](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/#size) replica or larger. This helps Materialize quickly process the initial snapshot of the tables in your publication. Once the snapshot is finished, you can right-size the cluster.

## Start ingesting data

Now that youâve configured your database network and created an ingestion cluster, you can connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [CREATE SECRET](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the password for the Postgres role you created earlier:

    ```sql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

    You can access the password for your Neon Postgres role from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

2. Use the [CREATE CONNECTION](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-connection/) command to create a connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to use:

    ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
    HOST '<host>',
    PORT 5432,
    USER '<role_name>',
    PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
    SSL MODE 'require',
    DATABASE '<database>'
    );
    ```

    You can find the connection details for your replication role in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. A Neon connection string looks like this:

    ```text shouldWrap
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your Neon hostname (e.g., `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`)
    - Replace `<role_name>` with the name of your Postgres role (e.g., `alex`)
    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables you want to replicate to Materialize (e.g., `dbname`)

3. Use the [CREATE SOURCE](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data from the publication you created earlier:

    ```sql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
    IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
    FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
    FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Tips">
    - To ingest data from specific schemas or tables in your publication, you can use `FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
    - After creating a source, you can incorporate upstream schema changes for specific replicated tables using the `ALTER SOURCE...{ADD | DROP} SUBSOURCE` syntax.
    </Admonition>

## Check the ingestion status

Before Materialize starts consuming a replication stream, it takes a snapshot of the tables in your publication. Until this snapshot is complete, Materialize wonât have the same view of your data as your Postgres database.

In this step, youâll verify that the source is running and then check the status of the snapshotting process.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [mz_source_statuses](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statuses) table to check the overall status of your source:

        ```sql
        WITH
        source_ids AS
        (SELECT id FROM mz_sources WHERE name = 'mz_source')
        SELECT *
        FROM
        mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
            JOIN
            (
                SELECT referenced_object_id
                FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
                WHERE
                object_id IN (SELECT id FROM source_ids)
                UNION SELECT id FROM source_ids
            )
            AS sources
            ON mz_source_statuses.id = sources.referenced_object_id;
            ```

        For each subsource, make sure the status is running. If you see stalled or failed, thereâs likely a configuration issue for you to fix. Check the error field for details and fix the issue before moving on. If the status of any subsource is starting for more than a few minutes, contact [Materialize support](https://materialize.com/docs/support/).

2. Once the source is running, use the [mz_source_statistics](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statistics) table to check the status of the initial snapshot:

        ```sql
        WITH
        source_ids AS
        (SELECT id FROM mz_sources WHERE name = 'mz_source')
        SELECT sources.object_id, bool_and(snapshot_committed) AS snapshot_committed
        FROM
        mz_internal.mz_source_statistics
            JOIN
            (
                SELECT object_id, referenced_object_id
                FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
                WHERE
                object_id IN (SELECT id FROM source_ids)
                UNION SELECT id, id FROM source_ids
            )
            AS sources
            ON mz_source_statistics.id = sources.referenced_object_id
        GROUP BY sources.object_id;
        object_id | snapshot_committed
        ----------|------------------
        u144     | t
        (1 row)
        ```

    Once `snapshot_commited` is `t`, move on to the next step. Snapshotting can take between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset and the size of the cluster replica you chose for your `ingest_postgres` cluster.

## Right-size the cluster

After the snapshotting phase, Materialize starts ingesting change events from the Postgres replication stream. For this work, Materialize generally performs well with an `xsmall` replica, so you can resize the cluster accordingly.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [ALTER CLUSTER](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/alter-cluster/) command to downsize the cluster to `xsmall`:

    ```sql
    ALTER CLUSTER ingest_postgres SET (SIZE 'xsmall');
    ```

    Behind the scenes, this command adds a new `xsmall` replica and removes the `medium` replica.

2. Use the [SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/show-cluster-replicas/) command to check the status of the new replica:

    ```sql
    SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS WHERE cluster = 'ingest_postgres';
        cluster     | replica |  size  | ready
    -----------------+---------+--------+-------
    ingest_postgres | r1      | xsmall | t
    (1 row)
    ```

3. Going forward, you can verify that your new replica size is sufficient as follows:

    a. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, get the replication slot name associated with your Postgres source from the [mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_postgres_sources) table:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            d.name AS database_name,
            n.name AS schema_name,
            s.name AS source_name,
            pgs.replication_slot
        FROM
            mz_sources AS s
            JOIN mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources AS pgs ON s.id = pgs.id
            JOIN mz_schemas AS n ON n.id = s.schema_id
            JOIN mz_databases AS d ON d.id = n.database_id;
        ```

    b. From a `psql` client connected to your Neon database or from the **Neon SQL Editor**, check the replication slot lag, using the replication slot name from the previous step:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            pg_size_pretty(pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn)
            AS replication_lag_bytes
        FROM pg_replication_slots
        WHERE slot_name = '<slot_name>';
        ```

        The result of this query is the amount of data your Postgres cluster must retain in its replication log because of this replication slot. Typically, this means Materialize has not yet communicated back to your Neon Postgres database that it has committed this data. A high value can indicate that the source has fallen behind and that you might need to scale up your ingestion cluster.

## Next steps

With Materialize ingesting your Postgres data into durable storage, you can start exploring the data, computing real-time results that stay up-to-date as new data arrives, and serving results efficiently.

- Explore your data with [SHOW SOURCES](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/show-sources) and [SELECT](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/).
- Compute real-time results in memory with [CREATE VIEW](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/) and [CREATE INDEX](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-index/) or in durable storage with [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/).
- Serve results to a Postgres-compatible SQL client or driver with [SELECT](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/) or [SUBSCRIBE](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/subscribe/) or to an external message broker with [CREATE SINK](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-sink/).
- Check out the [tools and integrations](https://materialize.com/docs/integrations/) supported by Materialize.

<LRNotice/>

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from Neon to external subscribers. This guide shows you how to stream data from a Neon Postgres database to an external Postgres database.

You will learn how to enable logical replication in Neon, create a publication, and configure an external Postgres database as a subscriber.

<Admonition type="important">
To prevent storage bloat, **Neon automatically removes _inactive_ replication slots after a period of time if there are other _active_ replication slots**. If you have or intend on having more than one replication slot, please see [Unused replication slots](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon#unused-replication-slots) to learn more.
</Admonition>

## Enable logical replication

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

After enabling logical replication, the next steps involve creating publications on your replication source database in Neon and configuring subscriptions on the destination system or service. These processes are the same as those you would perform in a standalone Postgres environment. 

## Create a publication

Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They allow you to specify a set of database changes that can be replicated to subscribers. This section walks you through creating a publication for a `users` table.

1. Create the `users` table in your Neon database. You can do this via the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or by connecting to your Neon database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

2. To create a publication for the `users` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
    ```

This command creates a publication named `users_publication`, which will include all changes to the `users` table in your replication stream.

With your publication created, you're now ready to configure a subscriber that will receive the data changes from this publication.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Configure PostgreSQL as a subscriber

A subscriber is a destination that receives data changes from your publications. 

This section describes how to configure a subscription on a standalone Postgres instance to a publication defined on your Neon database. After the subscription is defined, the destination Postgres instance will be able to receive data changes from the publication defined on your Neon database.

It is assumed that you have a separate Postgres instance ready to act as the subscriber. This must be a Postgres instance other than Neon, such as a local PostgreSQL installation. Currently, a Neon database cannot be defined as a subscriber. The PostgreSQL version of the subscriber should be compatible with the publisher. The primary (publishing) server must be of the same or a higher version than the replica (subscribing) server. For example, you can replicate from PostgreSQL 14 to 16, but not from 16 to 14. Neon supports Postgres 14, 15, and 16. The Postgres version is defined when you create a Neon project.

### Create a subscription

1. Use `psql` or another SQL client to connect to your subscriber Postgres database.
2. Create the subscription using the using a `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` statement. This example creates a subscription for the `user` table publication (`users_publication`) that you created previously.

    ```sql
    CREATE SUBSCRIPTION users_subscription 
    CONNECTION 'postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname' 
    PUBLICATION users_publication;
    ```

    - `subscription_name`: A name you chose for the subscription.
    - `connection_string`: The connection string for your Neon database, where you defined the publication.
    - `publication_name`: The name of the publication you created on your Neon database.

3. Verify the subscription was created by running the following command: 

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
    ```

    The subscription (`users_subscription`) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been successfully created.

## Test the replication

Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber (from your Neon database to your standalone Postgres instance).

First, generate some changes in the `users` table on the publisher database to see if these changes are replicated to the subscriber:

1. Connect to your Neon database (the publisher) and perform an `INSERT` operation. For example:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('new_user', 'new_user@example.com');
    ```

2. After making changes, query the `users` table on the publisher to confirm your `INSERT`:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

    Note the changes you made for comparison with the subscriber's data.

3. Now, connect to your subscriber database on your standalone Postgres instance:

    ```bash
    psql -h [server_IP_or_hostname] -U [username] -d [database] -W
    ```

4. Query the `users` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

  Compare the results with what you observed on the publisher.

4. On the subscriber, you can also check the status of the replication:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
    ```

    Look for the `last_msg_receive_time` to confirm that the subscription is active and receiving data.

title: Project sharing
subtitle: Learn how to share your Neon project with others
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-19T18:57:12.559Z'
---

You can share a Neon project with other users, giving them access to your Neon project from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console, Neon API, and Neon CLI. Follow this guide to learn how.

## Set up Neon accounts

You can share your Neon project with anyone. The only requirement is that the user has a Neon account. The account can be a Neon Free Tier account or a paid plan account.

1. If the user does not have a Neon account, ask them to sign up. You can provide your users with the following instructions: [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
2. Request the email address the user signed up with. If the user signed up with a Google or GitHub account, ask for the email address associated with that account.

## Share your project

After a user has provided you with the email address associated with their Neon account, you can share your project with that user.

To share your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. Select the project you want to share.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Project settings** from the sidebar.
1. On the **Project settings** page, select **Sharing**.
1. Under **Grant access to your project**, enter the email address of the account you want to share your project with.
    ![Grant access to a project](/docs/guides/sharing_grant_access.png)
1. Click **Grant access**. The email you specify is added to the list of **Users with access to the project**.
    ![People with access](/docs/guides/sharing_people_with_access.png)

    The Neon account associated with the email address is granted full access to the project with the exception privileges required to delete the project. This account can also share the project with other Neon users. When the user logs in to Neon, the shared project is listed on their **Projects** page, under **Shared with me**.

    ![Project shared with me](/docs/guides/shared_with_me.png)

    An email is also sent to the email address informing the user that a project has been shared with them. The email includes an **Open project** link the user can click on to log in to Neon. After logging in, the user is directed to the **Dashboard** for the shared project in the Neon Console.

## Shared project limits

The users you share a project with operate within your project allowances rather than their Neon Free Tier project allowances when using your project. For example, a Neon Free Tier user is limited to 10 branches in their own project. When using your project, there is no such restriction. For an overview of plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

## Access to a shared project via the Neon API or CLI

The users you share a project with can access the project from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console, [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), and [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli).

Users can access a shared project via the Neon API using an API key from their own Neon account. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

When using the Neon CLI, users authenticate as they would normally. Users are able to access their own Neon projects as well as shared projects. See [Neon CLI â Connect](/docs/reference/cli-install#connect) for authentication instructions.

## Shared project billing

The costs associated with a shared project are charged to the Neon account that owns the project. For example, if you share your project with another Neon user account, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Neon account.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T18:34:05.858Z'
---

[Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) are supported with the Neon paid plans. This guide will lead you through the process of creating and managing read replicas.

The general methodology of using read replicas to segregate read-only work from your production database operations can be applied to a variety of uses cases, such as:

- Offloading analytics or reporting queries
- Distributing read requests to achieve higher throughput
- Providing read-only data access to specific users or applications who do not need to modify data
- Configuring different CPU and memory resources for each read replica for different users and applications

Regardless of the application, the steps for creating, configuring, and connecting to a read replica are the same. You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the vCPU and memory allocated to each. Neon's _Autoscaling_ and _Autosuspend_ features are also supported, providing you with control over compute usage.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon paid plan account
- A [Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to a branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint to any branch in your Neon project using the Neon Console, [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create), or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To create a read replica from the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable autoscaling by configuring a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is automatically suspended. The default setting is 5 minutes.
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database.
    </Admonition>
6. When you have finished making your selections, click **Create**.

In a few moments, your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page. This is your read replica. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To create a read replica using the Neon CLI, use the [branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches) command, specifying the `add-compute` subcommand with `--type read_only`. If you have more than one Neon project, also include the `--project-id` option.  


```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint. To create a read-only compute endpoint using the Neon API,  use the [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) method. The `type` attribute in the following example specifies `read_only`, which creates a read-only compute endpoint. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `branch_id` parameters, refer to [Create an endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '

## Connect to a read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select a **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select a connection string or a code example from the drop-down menu and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

    A **psql** connection string appears similar to the following:

    ```bash
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string or example.

    When you use a read-only connection string, you are connecting to a read replica. No write operations are permitted on this connection.

## View read replicas

You can view read replicas using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To view read replicas for a branch, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. Under the **Computes** heading, the **Type** field identifies your read replicas. Read replicas have a `R/O` value instead of `R/W`.

![View read replicas](/docs/guides/view_read_replica.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint.  To view read-only compute endpoints with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), use the [Get endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method. 

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

# Data analysis and reporting

subtitle: Leverage read replicas for running data-intensive queries
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.289Z'
---

With Neon's read replica feature, you can instantly create a dedicated read-only compute instance for running data-intensive analytics or reporting queries. This allows you to avoid disruption or performance degradation on your production database.

A read replica reads data from the same source as your read-write compute instance. There's no data replication, so creating a read replica is a near-instant process. For more information about Neon's read replica architecture, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

Suppose you have a `sales` table in your production database. The table and data might look something like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO sales (product_id, sale_amount, sale_date) VALUES
(1, 20.50, '2022-07-24'),
(2, 35.99, '2022-08-24'),
(1, 20.50, '2022-09-24'),
(3, 15.00, '2023-01-24'),
(1, 20.50, '2023-04-24');
...
```

You want to find the total sale amount for each product in the past year, but due to the large number of products and sales in your database, you know it's a costly query that could impact performance on your production system.

This guide walks you through creating a read replica, connecting to it, running your query, and optionally deleting the read replica when finished.

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to a branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint to any branch in your Neon project by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a fixed size compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable autoscaling by configuring a minimum and maximum compute size using the slider. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your compute automatically suspends due to inactivity. The default setting is 5 minutes.
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database.
    </Admonition>
6. When you finish making your selections, click **Create**.

Your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page. This is your read replica. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

<CodeTabs labels={["API", "CLI"]}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Connect to the read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select the **RO-replica** compute endpoint.
1. Select a **Database** and the **Role** you want to connect with.
1. Copy the connection string. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

    The connection string appears similar to the following:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string.

    The information in your connection string corresponds to the following connection details:

    - role: `alex`
    - password:`AbC123dEf`
    - hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
    - database name: `dbname`. Your database name may differ.

    When you connect to a read-only compute, no write operations are permitted on the connection.

1. Connect to your application from a client such as `psql` or add the connection details to your application. For example, to connect using `psql`, issue the following command:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    psql postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

## Run the analytics query on the read replica

An analytics query on your `sales` table might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(sale_amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year')
GROUP BY product_id;
```

If you have a lot of products and sales, this query might impact performance on your production system, but running the query on your read replica, which has its own dedicated compute resources, causes no disruption.

## Delete the read replica

When you are finished running analytics queries, you can delete the read replica if it's no longer required. Deleting a read replica is a permanent action, but you can quickly create a new read replica when you need one.

To delete a read replica:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, find the read-only compute endpoint you want to delete. Read replicas have a `RO replica` type.
1. Click the compute endpoint menu on the right side of the table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

A Neon read replica is an independent read-only compute instance that performs read operations on the same data as your read-write compute, which means adding a read replica to a Neon project requires no additional storage.

A key benefit of read replicas is that you can distribute read requests to one or more read replica compute instances, enabling you to easily scale your applications and achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.

For more information about Neon's read replica feature, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

In this guide, we'll show you how you can leverage Neon read replicas to efficiently scale Prisma applications using Prisma Client's read replica extension: [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas).

## Prerequisites

- An application that uses Prisma with a Neon database.
- A paid plan account. Read replicas are a paid plan feature.

## Create a read replica

You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project. Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to the Neon branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable autoscaling by configuring a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is automatically suspended. The default setting is 5 minutes.
   <Admonition type="note">
   The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
   </Admonition>
6. When you finish making selections, click **Create**.

   Your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

<CodeTabs labels={["API", "CLI"]}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Retrieve the connection string for your read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch in a Neon project, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to retrieve the connection string (the URL) for a read replica from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select your **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select the connection string and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from your Prisma Client. The connection string appears similar to the following:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
   ```

   If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string, but remember to append `?pgbouncer=true` to the connection string when using a pooled connection. Prisma requires this flag when using Prisma Client with PgBouncer. See [Use connection pooling with Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma) for more information.

## Update your env file

In your `.env` file, set a `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your read replica. Your `.env` file should look something like this, with your regular `DATABASE_URL` and the newly added `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL`.

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
DATABASE_REPLICA_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-damp-cell-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Notice that the `endpoint_id` (`ep-damp-cell-123456`) for the read replica compute differs. The read replica is a different compute instance and therefore has a different `endpoint_id`.

## Configure Prisma Client to use a read replica

[@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) adds support to Prisma Client for read replicas. The following steps show you how to install the extension and configure it to use a Neon read replica.

1. Install the extension in your Prisma project:

   ```bash
   npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
   ```

2. Extend your Prisma Client instance by importing the extension and adding the `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable as shown:

   ```javascript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
   import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas';

   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
     readReplicas({
       url: DATABASE_REPLICA_URL,
     })
   );
   ```

   <Admonition type="note">
   You can also pass an array of read replica connection strings if you want to use multiple read replicas. Neon supports adding multiple read replicas to a database branch.

   ```javascript
   // lib/prisma.ts
   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
     readReplicas({
       url: [process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_1, process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_2],
     })
   );
   ```

   </Admonition>

   When your application runs, read operations are sent to the read replica. If you specify multiple read replicas, a read replica is selected randomly.

   All write and `$transaction` queries are sent to the primary compute endpoint defined by `DATABASE_URL`, which is your read/write compute endpoint.

   If you want to read from the primary compute endpoint and bypass read replicas, you can use the `$primary()` method in your extended Prisma Client instance:

   ```bash
   const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
   ```

   This Prisma Client query will be routed to your primary database.

## Examples

This example demonstrates how to use the [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) extension in Prisma Client. It uses a simple TypeScript script to read and write data in a Postgres database.

To connect to Neon from a Django application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Configure Django connection settings](#configure-django-connection-settings)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Configure Django connection settings

Connecting to Neon requires configuring database connection settings in your Django project's `settings.py` file.

<Admonition type="note">
To avoid the `endpiont ID is not specified` connection issue described [here](#connection-issues), be sure that you are using an up-to-date driver.
</Admonition>

In your Django project, navigate to the `DATABASES` section of your `settings.py` file and modify the connection details as shown:

```python
# Add these at the top of your settings.py
from os import getenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Replace the DATABASES section of your settings.py with this
DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
    'NAME': getenv('PGDATABASE'),
    'USER': getenv('PGUSER'),
    'PASSWORD': getenv('PGPASSWORD'),
    'HOST': getenv('PGHOST'),
    'PORT': getenv('PGPORT', 5432),
    'OPTIONS': {
      'sslmode': 'require',
    },
    'DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS': True,
  }
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon places computes into an `Idle` state and closes connections after 5 minutes of inactivity (see [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle/)). To avoid connection errors, you can set the Django [CONN_MAX_AGE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-CONN_MAX_AGE) setting to 0 to close database connections at the end of each request so that your application does not attempt to reuse connections that were closed by Neon. From Django 4.1, you can use a higher `CONN_MAX_AGE` setting in combination with the [CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#conn-health-checks) setting to enable connection reuse while preventing errors that might occur due to closed connections. For more information about these configuration options, see [Connection management](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/databases#connection-management), in the _Django documentation_.
</Admonition>

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

For additional information about Django project settings, see [Django Settings: Databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings#databases), in the Django documentation.

## Connection issues

Django uses the `psycopg2` driver as the default adapter for Postgres. If you have an older version of that driver, you may encounter an `Endpoint ID is not specified` error when connecting to Neon. This error occurs if the client library used by your driver does not support the Server Name Indication (SNI) mechanism in TLS, which Neon uses to route incoming connections. The `psycopg2` driver uses the `libpq` client library, which supports SNI as of v14. You can check your `psycopg2` and `libpq` versions by starting a Django shell in your Django project and running the following commands:

```bash
# Start a Django shell
python3 manage.py shell

# Check versions
import psycopg2
print("psycopg2 version:", psycopg2.__version__)
print("libpq version:", psycopg2._psycopg.libpq_version())
```

The version number for `libpq` is presented in a different format, for example, version 14.1 will be shown as 140001. If your `libpq` version is less than version 14, you can either upgrade your `psycopg2` driver to get a newer `libpq` version or use one of the workarounds described in our [Connection errors](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified) documentation. Upgrading your `psycopg2` driver may introduce compatibility issues with your Django or Python version, so you should test your application thoroughly.

Next.js by Vercel is an open-source web development framework that enables React-based web applications. This topic describes how to create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application.

To create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Next.js project and add dependencies](#create-a-nextjs-project-and-add-dependencies)
3. [Configure a Postgres client](#configure-the-postgres-client)
4. [Run the app](#run-the-app)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Next.js project and add dependencies

1. Create a Next.js project if you do not have one. For instructions, see [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup), in the Vercel documentation.

2. Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:

    <CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

      ```shell
      npm install pg
      ```

      ```shell
      npm install postgres
      ```

      ```shell
      npm install @neondatabase/serverless
      ```

    </CodeTabs>

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

```shell shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

## Configure the Postgres client

There a multiple ways to make server side requests with Next.js. See below for the different implementations.

### App Router

From your server functions using the App Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

async function getData() {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return response.rows[0];
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

async function getData() {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return response;
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

async function getData() {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return response;
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}

```

</CodeTabs>

### Pages Router

There are two methods for fetching data using server-side requests in Next.js they are:

1. `getServerSideProps` fetches data at runtime so that content is always fresh.
2. `getStaticProps` pre-renders pages at build time for data that is static or changes infrequently.

#### getServerSideProps

From `getServerSideProps` using the Pages Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return { props: { data: response.rows[0] } };
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return { props: { data: response } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return { props: { data: response } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

</CodeTabs>

#### getStaticProps

From `getStaticProps` using the Pages Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return { props: { data: response.rows[0] } };
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return { props: { data: response } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return { props: { data: response } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Serverless Functions

From your Serverless Functions, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);

    res.status(200).json({
      data: response.rows[0]
    })

  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);

  res.status(200).json({
    data: response
  })
}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);

  res.status(200).json({
    data: response
  })
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Edge Functions

From your Edge Functions, add the following code snippet and connect to your Neon database using the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver):

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response)

  return Response.json({
    data: response,
  });
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

## Run the app

When you run `npm run dev` you can expect to see one of the following in your terminal output:

```shell shouldWrap
# node-postgres & Neon serverless driver

{
  version: 'PostgreSQL 16.0 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit'
}

# postgres.js

[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a Java framework optimized for cloud environments. This guide shows how to connect to Neon from a Quarkus project using the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.

To connect to Neon from a Quarkus application using the Postgres JDBC Driver:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Quarkus project and add dependencies](#create-a-quarkus-project)
3. [Configure a PostgreSQL data source](#configure-a-postgresql-data-source)
4. [Use the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](#use-the-postgresql-jdbc-driver)
5. [Run the application](#run-the-application)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Quarkus project

Create a Quarkus project using the [Quarkus CLI](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling):

```shell
quarkus create app neon-with-quarkus-jdbc \
--name neon-with-quarkus-jdbc \
--package-name com.neon.tech \
--extensions jdbc-postgresql,quarkus-agroal,resteasy-reactive
```

You now have a Quarkus project in a folder named `neon-with-quarkus-jdbc` with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, Agroal datasource implementation, and RESTEasy Reactive extensions installed.

## Configure a PostgreSQL data source

Create a `.env` file in the root of your Quarkus project directory. Configure a JDBC data source using the components of your Neon database connection string and specifying the database kind as shown:

```shell shouldWrap
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_DB_KIND=postgresql
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=[user]
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=[password]
# Note that "jdbc" is prepended, and that "?sslmode=require" is appended to the connection string
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

<Admonition type="note">
You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).
</Admonition>

## Use the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver

Create a `PostgresResource.java` file in the same directory as the `GreetingResource.java` that was generated by Quarkus during project creation. Paste the following content into the `PostgresResource.java` file:

```java
package com.neon.tech;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import javax.sql.DataSource;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/postgres")
public class PostgresResource {
    @Inject
    DataSource dataSource;

    @GET
    @Path("/version")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getVersion() {
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
                Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {

            ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT version()");

            if (resultSet.next()) {
                return resultSet.getString(1);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

This code defines a HTTP endpoint that will query the database version and return it as a response to incoming requests.

## Run the application

Start the application in development mode using the Quarkus CLI from the root of the project directory:

```shell
quarkus dev
```

Visit [localhost:8080/postgres/version](http://localhost:8080/postgres/version) in your web browser. Your Neon database's Postgres version will be returned. For example:

```
PostgreSQL 15.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit

Remix is an open-source full stack JavaScript framework that lets you focus on building out the user interface using familiar web standards. This guide explains how to connect Remix with Neon using a secure server-side request.

To create a Neon project and access it from a Remix application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Remix project and add dependencies](#create-a-remix-project-and-add-dependencies)
3. [Configure a Postgres client](#configure-the-postgres-client)
4. [Run the app](#run-the-app)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Remix project and add dependencies

1. Create a Remix project if you do not have one. For instructions, see [Quick Start](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/quickstart), in the Remix documentation.

2. Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:

    <CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

      ```shell
      npm install pg
      ```

      ```shell

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

```shell shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

## Configure the Postgres client

There are two parts to connecting a Remix application to Neon. The first is `db.server`. Remix will ensure any code added to this file won't be included in the client bundle. The second is the route where the connection to the database will be used.

### db.server

Create a `db.server.ts` file at the root of your `/app` directory and add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';

const pool = new pg.Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true,
});

export { pool };
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

export { sql };
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

export { sql };
```

</CodeTabs>

### route

Create a new route in your `app/routes` directory and import the `db.server` file.  

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { pool } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return json({ data: response.rows[0] });
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { sql } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return json({ data: response });
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { sql } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return json({ data: response });
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```

</CodeTabs>

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), also known simply as Rails, is an open-source web application framework written in Ruby. It uses a model-view-controller architecture, making it a good choice for developing database-backed web applications. This guide shows how to connect to a Ruby on Rails application to a Neon Postgres database.

To connect to Neon from a Ruby on Rails application:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Rails Project](#create-a-rails-project)
3. [Configure a PostgreSQL Database using Rails](#configure-a-postgresql-database-using-rails)
4. [Create a Rails Controller](#create-a-rails-controller-to-query-the-database)
5. [Run the application](#run-the-application)

This guide was tested using Ruby v3.3.0 and Rails v7.1.2.

## Create a Neon Project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Rails Project

Create a Rails project using the [Rails CLI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html), and specify PostgreSQL as the database type:

```shell
gem install rails
rails new neon-with-rails --database=postgresql
```

You now have a Rails project in a folder named `neon-with-rails`.

## Configure a PostgreSQL Database using Rails

Create a `.env` file in the root of your Rails project, and add the connection string for your Neon compute. Do not specify a database name after the forward slash in the connection string. Rails will choose the correct database depending on the environment.

```shell shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/
```

<Admonition type="note">
You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="important">
The role you specified in the `DATABASE_URL` must have **CREATEDB** privileges. Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in theÂ [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role)Â role, which has the `CREATEDB` privilege. Alternatively, you can create roles with SQL to grant specific privileges. See [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).
</Admonition>

Create the development database by issuing the following commands from the root of your project directory:

```shell
# Load the DATABASE_URL into your session
source .env

# Create the development database
bin/rails db:create
```

## Create a Rails Controller to Query the Database

Run the following command to create a controller and view. The controller will query the database version and supply it to the view file to render a web page that displays the PostgreSQL version.

```shell
rails g controller home index
```

Replace the controller contents at `app/controllers/home_controller.rb` with:

```ruby
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @version = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT version();").first['version']
  end
end
```

Replace the contents of the view file at `app/views/home/index.html.erb` with:

```ruby
<% if @version %>
  <p><%= @version %></p>
<% end %>
```

Replace the contents of `config/routes.rb` with the following code to serve your home view as the root page of the application:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do.
  get "up" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  root 'home#index'
end
```

## Run the application

Start the application using the Rails CLI from the root of the project:

```shell
bin/rails server -e development
```

Visit [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser. Your Neon database's Postgres version will be displayed. For example:

```

This guide describes how to connect from an Elixir application with Ecto, which is a database wrapper and query generator for Elixir. Ecto provides an API and abstractions for interacting databases, enabling Elixir developers to query any database using similar constructs.

The instructions in this guide follow the steps outlined in the [Ecto Getting Started](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#content) guide, modified to demonstrate connecting to a Neon Serverless Postgres database. It is assumed that you have a working installation of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

To connect to Neon from Elixir with Ecto:

1. [Create a database in Neon and copy the connection string](#create-a-database-in-neon-and-copy-the-connection-string)
2. [Create an Elixir project](#create-an-elixir-project)
3. [Add Ecto and Postgrex to the application](#add-ecto-and-postgrex-to-the-application)
4. [Configure Ecto](#configure-ecto)
5. [Create a migration and add a table](#create-a-migration-and-add-a-table)
6. [Next steps](#next-steps)

## Create a database in Neon and copy the connection string

The instructions in this configuration use a database named `friends`.

To create the database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases**.
1. Select the branch where you want to create the database.
1. Click **New Database**.
1. Enter a database name (`friends`), and select a database owner.
1. Click **Create**.

You can obtain the connection string for the database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you. Your connection string should look something like this:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/friends
```

You will need the connection string details later in the setup.

## Create an Elixir project

Create an Elixir application called `friends`.

```bash
mix new friends --sup
```

The `--sup` option ensures that the application has a supervision tree, which is required by Ecto.

## Add Ecto and Postgrex to the application

1. Add the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies to the `mix.exs` file by updating the `deps` definition in the file to include those items. For example:

    ```bash
    defp deps do
      [
        {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.0"},
        {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"}
      ]
    end
    ```

    Ecto provides the common querying API. The Postgrex driver acts as a bridge between Ecto and Postgres. Ecto interfaces with its own `Ecto.Adapters.Postgres` module, which communicates to Postgres through the Postgrex driver.

2. Install the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies by running the following command in your application directory:

    ```bash
    mix deps.get
    ```

## Configure Ecto

Run the following command in your application directory to generate the configuration required to connect from Ecto to your Neon database.

```bash
mix ecto.gen.repo -r Friends.Repo
```

Follow these steps to complete the configuration:

1. The first part of the configuration generated by the `mix ecto.gen.repo` command is found in the `config/config.exs` file. Update this configuration with your Neon database connection details. Use the connection details from the Neon connection string you copied in the first part of the guide. Your `hostname` will differ from the example below.

    ```elixir
    config :friends, Friends.Repo,
      database: "friends",
      username: "alex",
      password: "AbC123dEf",
      hostname: "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech",
      ssl: true,
      ssl_opts: [
        server_name_indication: 'ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech',
        verify: :verify_none
      ]
    ```

    The `ssl: true` and `ssl_opts` settings are required to connect to Neon. Neon uses domain names provided via the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to route incoming connections. Enabling `ssl` and setting `ssl_opts` with the `server_name_indication` option set to your Neon hostname ensures that this information is passed to Neon when making a connection. The `verify: :verify_none` setting tells Ecto to ignore SSL certificate verification when connecting to your database, but keep in mind that it is better to use SSL with proper certificate verification. That `ssl_opts` configuration is as follows:

    ```elixir
    ssl_opts: [
      cacertfile: "/path/to/certfile.crt",
      verify: :verify_peer,
      server_name_indication: to_charlist('ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech'),
      customize_hostname_check: [
        # By default, Erlang does not support wildcard certificates. This function supports validating wildcard hosts
        match_fun: :public_key.pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun(:https)
      ]
    ]
    ```

2. The second part of the configuration generated by the `mix ecto.gen.repo` command is the `Ecto.Repo` module, found in `lib/friends/repo.ex`. You shouldn't have to make any changes here, but verify that the following configuration is present:

    ```elixir
    defmodule Friends.Repo do
    use Ecto.Repo,
        otp_app: :friends,
        adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
    end
    ```

    Ecto uses the module definition to query the database. The `otp_app` setting tells Ecto where to find the database configuration. In this case, the `:friends` application is specified, so Ecto will use the configuration defined in the that application's `config/config.exs` file. The `:adapter` option defines the Postgres adapter.

3. Next, the `Friends.Repo` must be defined as a supervisor within the application's supervision tree. In `lib/friends/application.ex`, make sure `Friends.Repo` is specified in the `start` function, as shown:

    ```elixir
    def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
        Friends.Repo,
    ]
    ```

    This configuration starts the Ecto process, enabling it to receive and execute the application's queries.

4. The final part of the configuration is to add the following line under the configuration in the `config/config.exs` file that you updated in the first step:

    ```elixir
    config :friends, ecto_repos: [Friends.Repo]
    ```

    This line tells the application about the new repo, allowing you to run commands such as `mix ecto.migrate`, which you will use in a later step to create a table in your database.

## Create a migration and add a table

Your `friends` database is currently empty. It has no tables or data. In this step, you will add a table. To do so, you will create a "migration" by running the following command in your application directory:

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration create_people
```

The command generates an empty migration file in `priv/repo/migrations`, which looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do

  end
end
```

Add code to the migration file to create a table called `people`. For example:

```elixir
defmodule Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:people) do
      add :first_name, :string
      add :last_name, :string
      add :age, :integer
    end
  end
end
```

To run the migration and create the `people` table in your database, which also verifies your connection to Neon, run the following command from your application directory:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

The output of this command should appear similar to the following:

```bash shouldWrap
14:30:04.924 [info]  == Running 20230524172817 Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople.change/0 forward
14:30:04.925 [info]  create table people
14:30:05.014 [info]  == Migrated 20230524172817 in 0.0s
```

You can use the **Tables** feature in the Neon Console to view the table that was created:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
1. Select the Branch, Database (`friends`), and the schema (`public`). You should see the `people` table along with a `schema_migration` table that was created by the migration.

## Application code

You can find the application code for the example above on GitHub.

## Next steps

The [Ecto Getting Started Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#content) provides additional steps that you can follow to create a schema, insert data, and run queries. See [Creating the schema](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#creating-the-schema ) in the _Ecto Getting Started Guide_ to pick up where the steps in this guide leave off.

## Usage notes

- Suppose you have `PGHOST` environment variable on your system set to something other than your Neon hostname. In that case, this hostname will be used instead of the Neon `hostname` defined in your Ecto Repo configuration when running `mix ecto` commands. To avoid this issue, you can either set the `PGHOST` environment variable to your Neon hostname or specify `PGHOST=""` when running `mix ecto` commands; for example: `PGHOST="" mix ecto.migrate`.
- By default, Neon's _Autosuspend_ feature scales computes to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity, which can result in a `connection not available` error when running `mix ecto` commands. Typically, a Neon compute takes a few seconds to transition from `Idle` to `Active`. Wait a few seconds and try running the command again. Alternatively, consider the strategies outlined in [Connection latency and timeouts](/docs/connect/connection-latency) to manage connection issues resulting from compute suspension.

This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or from a Spring Data project that uses JDBC.

The JDBC API is a Java API for relational databases. Postgres has a well-supported open-source JDBC driver which can be used to access Neon. All popular Java frameworks use JDBC internally. To connect to Neon, you are only required to provide a connection URL.

For additional information about JDBC, refer to the JDBC API documentation, and the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation).

To connect to Neon with JDBC or from a Spring Data project:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Connect with JDBC](#connect-with-jdbc) or [Connect from Spring Data](#connect-from-spring-data)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Connect with JDBC

For a JDBC connection URL, replace the variables in the following URL string with your Neon project ID, database name, user, and password:

```java
jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require 
```


You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Connect from Spring Data

Spring Data relies on JDBC and Postgres drivers to connect to Postgres databases, such as Neon. If you are starting your project with Spring Initializr or connecting from an existing Spring Data project, ensure that the `PostgreSQL database driver` dependency is installed.

Connecting from a Spring Data project requires specifying the datasource URL in your `application.properties` file, as shown in the following example:

```java
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
```

Refer to the [Connect with JDBC](#connect-with-jdbc) section above for information about obtaining connection details for your Neon database.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a NodeJS project and add dependencies

1. Create a NodeJS project and change to the newly created directory.

   ```shell
   mkdir neon-nodejs-example
   cd neon-nodejs-example
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:

    <CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js"]}>

      ```

      ```shell
      npm install postgres dotenv
      ```

    </CodeTabs>

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project directory and add your Neon connection details to it. You can find the connection details for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Please select Node.js from the **Connection string** dropdown. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

```shell shouldWrap
PGHOST='[neon_hostname]'
PGDATABASE='[dbname]'
PGUSER='[user]'
PGPASSWORD='[password]'
ENDPOINT_ID='[endpoint_id]'
```

<Admonition type="note">
A special `ENDPOINT_ID` variable is included in the `.env` file above. This variable can be used with older Postgres clients that do not support Server Name Indication (SNI), which Neon relies on to route incoming connections. If you are using a newer [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) or [postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) client, you won't need it. For more information, see [Endpoint ID variable](#endpoint-id-variable).
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="important">
To ensure the security of your data, never expose your Neon credentials to the browser.
</Admonition>

## Configure the Postgres client

Add an `app.js` file to your project directory and add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
  
<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js"]}>

  ```javascript
  const { Pool } = require('pg');
  require('dotenv').config();

  let { PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD } = process.env;

  const pool = new Pool({
    host: PGHOST,
    database: PGDATABASE,
    username: PGUSER,
    password: PGPASSWORD,
    port: 5432,
    ssl: {
      require: true,
    },
  });

  async function getPgVersion() {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      const result = await client.query('SELECT version()');
      console.log(result.rows[0]);
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }

  getPgVersion();
  ```

  ```javascript
  const postgres = require('postgres');
  require('dotenv').config();

  let { PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD } = process.env;

  const sql = postgres({
    host: PGHOST,
    database: PGDATABASE,
    username: PGUSER,
    password: PGPASSWORD,
    port: 5432,
    ssl: 'require',
  });

  async function getPgVersion() {
    const result = await sql`select version()`;
    console.log(result[0]);
  }

  getPgVersion();
  ```

</CodeTabs>

## Run app.js

Run `node app.js` to view the result.

```shell
{
  version: 'PostgreSQL 16.0 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit'
}
```

## Endpoint ID variable

For older clients that do not support Server Name Indication (SNI), the `postgres.js` example below shows how to include the `ENDPOINT_ID` variable in your application's connection configuration. This is a workaround that is not required if you are using a newer [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) or [postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) client. For more information about this workaround and when it is required, see [The endpoint ID is not specified](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified) in our [connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors) documentation.

```javascript
// app.js
const postgres = require('postgres');
require('dotenv').config();

let { PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, ENDPOINT_ID } = process.env;

const sql = postgres({
  host: PGHOST,
  database: PGDATABASE,
  username: PGUSER,
  password: PGPASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
  ssl: 'require',
  connection: {
    options: `project=${ENDPOINT_ID}`,
  },
});

Prisma is an open-source, next-generation ORM that lets you to manage and interact with your database. This guide covers the following topics:

- [Connect to Neon from Prisma](#connect-to-neon-from-prisma)
- [Use connection pooling with Prisma](#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma)
- [Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma](#use-the-neon-serverless-driver-with-prisma)
- [Connection timeouts](#connection-timeouts)
- [Connection pool timeouts](#connection-pool-timeouts)
- [JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas](#json-protocol-for-large-prisma-schemas)

## Connect to Neon from Prisma

To establish a basic connection from Prisma to Neon, perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve your Neon connection string. In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
  ![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)
  The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

2. Add the following lines to your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to identify the data source and database URL:

   ```typescript
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url   = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. Add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding `?sslmode=require` to the end of the connection string to ensure a [secure connection](/docs/connect/connect-securely).

   Your setting will appear similar to the following:

   ```text shouldWrap
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
   ```

<Admonition type="important">
If you plan to use Prisma Client from a serverless function, see [Use connection pooling with Prisma](#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma) for additional configuration instructions. To adjust your connection string to avoid connection timeout issues, see [Connection timeouts](#connection-timeouts).
</Admonition>

## Use connection pooling with Prisma

Serverless functions can require a large number of database connections as demand increases. If you use serverless functions in your application, we recommend that you use a pooled Neon connection string, as shown:

```ini shouldWrap
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

A pooled Neon connection string adds `-pooler` to the endpoint ID, which tells Neon to use a pooled connection. You can add `-pooler` to your connection string manually or copy a pooled connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Use the **Pooled connection** checkbox to add the `-pooler` suffix.

### Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate

Prior to Prisma ORM 5.10, attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as `prisma migrate dev`, with a pooled connection caused the following error:

```text
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
```

To avoid this issue, you can define a direct connection to the database for Prisma Migrate or you can upgrade Prisma ORM to 5.10 or higher.

#### Using a direct connection to the database 

You can configure a direct connection while allowing applications to use Prisma Client with a pooled connection by adding a `directUrl` property to the datasource block in your `schema.prisma` file. For example:

```typescript
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
The `directUrl` property is available in Prisma version [4.10.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.10.0) and higher. For more information about this property, refer to the [Prisma schema reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields).
</Admonition>

After adding the `directUrl` property to your `schema.prisma` file, update the `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` variables settings in your `.env` file:

1. Set `DATABASE_URL` to the pooled connection string for your Neon database. Applications that require a pooled connection should use this connection.
1. Set `DIRECT_URL` to the direct (non-pooled) connection string. This is the direct connection to the database required by Prisma Migrate. Other Prisma CLI operations may also require a direct connection.

When you finish updating your `.env` file, your variable settings should appear similar to the following:

```ini shouldWrap
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"

# Unpooled Neon connection string
DIRECT_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

#### Using a pooled connection with Prisma Migrate

With Prisma ORM 5.10 or higher, you can use a pooled Neon connection string with Prisma Migrate. In this case, you only need to define the pooled connection string in your `schema.prisma` file. Adding a `directUrl` property to the datasource block in your `schema.prisma` file and defining a `DIRECT_URL` setting in your environment file are not required. Your complete configuration will look like this:

`schema.prisma` file:

```typescript
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url   = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

`.env` file:


```ini
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

## Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma

The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that lets you query data from serverless and edge environments. For more information about the driver, see [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver).

To set up Prisma with the Neon serverless driver, use the Prisma driver adapter. This adapter allows you to choose a different database driver than Prisma's default driver for communicating with your database.

The Prisma driver adapter feature is available in **Preview** in Prisma version 5.4.2 and later.

To get started, enable the `driverAdapters` Preview feature flag in your `schema.prisma` file, as shown:

```javascript
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Install the Prisma adapter for Neon, the Neon serverless driver, and `ws` packages:

```bash
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon @neondatabase/serverless ws
npm install --save-dev @types/ws
```

Update your Prisma Client instance:

```javascript
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import ws from 'ws'

dotenv.config()
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws
const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString })
const adapter = new PrismaNeon(pool)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

You can now use Prisma Client as you normally would with full type-safety. Prisma Migrate, introspection, and Prisma Studio will continue working as before, using the Neon connection string defined by the `DATABASE_URL` variable in your `schema.prisma` file.

## Connection timeouts

A connection timeout that occurs when connecting from Prisma to Neon causes an error similar to the following:

```text shouldWrap
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
```

This error most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before the Neon compute was activated.

A Neon compute has two main states: _Active_ and _Idle_. Active means that the compute is currently running. If there is no query activity for 5 minutes, Neon places a compute into an idle state by default.

When you connect to an idle compute from Prisma, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds but added latency can result in a connection timeout. To address this issue, you can adjust your Neon connection string by adding a `connect_timeout` parameter. This parameter defines the maximum number of seconds to wait for a new connection to be opened. The default value is 5 seconds. A higher setting may provide the time required to avoid connection timeouts. For example:

```text shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10"
```

<Admonition type="note">
A `connect_timeout` setting of 0 means no timeout.
</Admonition>

## Connection pool timeouts

Another possible cause of timeouts is [Prisma's connection pool](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/). The Prisma query engine manages a pool of connections. The pool is instantiated when a Prisma Client opens a first connection to the database. For an explanation of how this connection pool functions, read [How the connection pool works](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool#how-the-connection-pool-works), in the _Prisma documentation_.

The default size of the Prisma connection pool is determined by the following formula: `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1`,  where `num_physical_cpus` represents the number of physical CPUs on the machine where your application runs. For example, if your machine has four physical CPUs, your connection pool will contain nine connections (4 * 2 + 1 = 9). As mentioned in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool#default-connection-pool-size), this formula is a good starting point, but the recommended connection limit also depends on your deployment paradigm â particularly if you are using serverless. You can specify the number of connections explicitly by setting the `connection_limit` parameter in your database connection URL. For example:

```text shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20"
```

For configuration guidance, refer to Prisma's [Recommended connection pool size guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#recommended-connection-pool-size).

In addition to pool size, you can configure a `pool_timeout` setting. This setting defines the amount of time the Prisma Client query engine has to process a query before it throws an exception and moves on to the next query in the queue. The default `pool_timeout` setting is 10 seconds. If you still experience timeouts after increasing `connection_limit` setting, you can try setting the `pool_timeout` parameter to a value larger than the default (10 seconds). For configuration guidance, refer to [Increasing the pool timeout](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#increasing-the-pool-timeout), in the _Prisma documentation_.

```text shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=15"
```

You can disable pool timeouts by setting `pool_timeout=0`.

## JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas

If you are working with a large Prisma schema, Prisma recently introduced a `jsonProtocol` wire protocol feature that expresses queries using `JSON` instead of GraphQL. The JSON implementation uses less CPU and memory, which can help reduce latencies when connecting from Prisma.

`jsonProtocol` is the default wire protocol as of Prisma version 5.0.0. If you run Prisma version 5.0.0 or later, you are already using the new protocol. If you run Prisma version 4 or earlier, you must use a feature flag to enable the `jsonProtocol`. You can read more about this feature here: [jsonProtocol changes](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-5/jsonprotocol-changes).

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Connecting to Neon from Laravel is the same as connecting to a standalone Postgres installation from Laravel. Only the connection details differ.

To connect to Neon from Laravel:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Configure the connection](#configure-the-connection)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Configure the connection

Open the `.env` file in your Laravel app, and replace all the database credentials.

```shell
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=[neon_hostname]
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=[dbname]
DB_USERNAME=[user]
DB_PASSWORD=[password]
DB_SSLMODE=require
```

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Connection issues

With older Postgres clients/drivers, including older PDO_PGSQL drivers, you may receive the following error when attempting to connect to Neon:

```txt shouldWrap
ERROR: The endpoint ID is not specified. Either upgrade the Postgres client library (libpq) for SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (the first part of the domain name) as a parameter: '&options=endpoint%3D'. See [https://neon.tech/sni](https://neon.tech/sni) for more information.
```

If you run into this error, please see the following documentation for an explanation of the issue and workarounds: [The endpoint ID is not specified](/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified).

-  If using a connection string to connect to your database, try [Workaround A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#a-pass-the-endpoint-id-as-an-option). For example:

    ```text
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?options=endpoint%3D[endpoint-id]
    ```

    Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

- If using database connection parameters, as shown above, try [Workaround D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field](/docs/connect/connection-errors#d-specify-the-endpoint-id-in-the-password-field). For example:

    ```text
    DB_PASSWORD=endpoint=<endpoint_id>$<password>

This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a simple Python application using [Psycopg (psycopg2)](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/), a popular Postgres database adapter for the Python programming language. The application connects to Neon and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

To connect:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Python project](#create-a-python-project)
3. [Store your Neon credentials](#store-your-neon-credentials)
4. [Configure your Python script](#configure-your-python-script)
5. [Test your connection](#test-your-connection)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

The project is created with a ready-to-use `neondb` database, which you will connect to.

## Create a Python project

1. Create a project directory and change to the newly created directory.

   ```shell
   mkdir neon-python-example
   cd neon-python-example
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment in this directory. The virtual environment isolates your project's Python environment (including installed packages) from the rest of your system.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment. When the virtual environment is activated, Python uses the environment's version of Python and any installed packages.

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install `psycopg2` and `python-dotenv` in your project's root directory. You can install them using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
    ```

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project's root directory and add your Neon connection string to it.

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

Your connection string will look something like this:

```shell shouldWrap
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

## Configure your python script

Add a `neon-connect.py` file to your project's root directory and add the following code. The script connects to your Neon database and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

```python
import os
import psycopg2
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the connection string from the environment variable
connection_string = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')

# Connect to the Postgres database
conn = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute SQL commands to retrieve the current time and version from PostgreSQL
cur.execute('SELECT NOW();')
time = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('SELECT version();')
version = cur.fetchone()[0]

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()

# Print the results
print('Current time:', time)
print('PostgreSQL version:', version)
```

## Test your connection

Run the `neon-connect.py` script to test your connection.

```shell
python3 neon-connect.py
```

If the connection is successful, the script returns information similar to the following:

```bash shouldWrap
Current time: 2023-05-24 08:53:10.403140+00:00
PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 15.2 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit

SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides application developers with the full power and flexibility of SQL. This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from SQLAlchemy.

**Prerequisites:**

To complete the steps in this topic, ensure that you have an SQLAlchemy installation with a Postgres driver. The following instructions use `psycopg2`, the default driver for Postgres in SQLAlchemy. For SQLAlchemy installation instructions, refer to the [SQLAlchemy Installation Guide](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/intro.html#installation). `psycopg2` installation instructions are provided below.

To connect to Neon from SQLAlchemy:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
1. [Install psycopg2](#install-psycopg2)
1. [Create the "hello neon" program](#create-the-hello-neon-program)
1. [Create an SQLAlchemy engine for your Neon project](#create-an-sqlalchemy-engine-for-your-neon-project)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details, including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Install psycopg2

Psycopg2 is a popular python library for running raw Postgres queries.

For most operating systems, the quickest installation method is using the PIP package manager. For example:

```shell
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

For additional information about installing `psycopg2`, refer to the [psycopg2 installation documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html).

## Create the "hello neon" program

```python
import psycopg2

# Optional: tell psycopg2 to cancel the query on Ctrl-C
import psycopg2.extras; psycopg2.extensions.set_wait_callback(psycopg2.extras.wait_select)

# You can set the password to None if it is specified in a ~/.pgpass file
USERNAME = "alex"
PASSWORD = "AbC123dEf"
HOST = "@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech"
PORT = "5432"
PROJECT = "dbname"

conn_str = f"dbname={PROJECT} user={USERNAME} password={PASSWORD} host={HOST} port={PORT} sslmode=require"

conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_str)

with conn.cursor() as cur:
 cur.execute("SELECT 'hello neon';")
 print(cur.fetchall())
```

You can find all of the connection details mentioned above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

<Admonition type="note">
This example was tested with Python 3 and psycopg2 version 2.9.3.
</Admonition>

## Create an SQLAlchemy engine for your Neon project

SQLAlchemy uses engine abstraction to manage database connections and exposes a `create_engine` function as the primary endpoint for engine initialization.

The following example creates an SQLAlchemy engine that points to your Neon branch:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

USERNAME = "alex"
PASSWORD = "AbC123dEf"
HOST = "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech"
DATABASE = "dbname"

conn_str = f'postgresql://{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}/{DATABASE}?sslmode=require'

engine = create_engine(conn_str)
```

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

For additional information about connecting from SQLAlchemy, refer to the following topics in the SQLAlchemy documentation:

_This guide was contributed by the Exograph team_

[Exograph](https://exograph.dev) is a new approach to building GraphQL backends. With it, you can effortlessly create flexible, secure, high-performing GraphQL backends in minutes. Powered by a Rust-based runtime, Exograph ensures fast startup times, efficient execution, and minimal memory consumption. Exograph comes equipped with a comprehensive set of tools designed to support every stage of the development lifecycle: from initial development to deployment to ongoing maintenance.

Exograph supports Postgres for data persistence, which makes it a great fit to use with Neon.

## Prerequisites

- Exograph CLI. See [Install Exograph](https://exograph.dev/docs/getting-started).
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a backend with Exograph

Let's create a starter project with Exograph. Run the following commands:

```bash
exo new todo
cd todo
```

You can check the code it created by examining the `src/index.exo` file (which has a definition for the `Todo` type). If you would like, you can try the [yolo](https://exograph.dev/docs/cli-reference/development/yolo) mode by trying the `exo yolo` command.

Next, let's set up the Neon database.

## Create the schema in Neon

1. Navigate to the Neon Console, select your project, and copy the connection string, which will look something like this: `postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname`.
2. Create schema in Neon using Exograph CLI:

```bash
exo schema create | psql <the connection string>
```

## Launch the backend

```bash
EXO_POSTGRES_URL=<the connection string> exo dev
```

It will print the necessary information for connecting to the backend.

```raw
Starting server in development mode...
Watching the src directory for changes...

Verifying new model...
Started server on 0.0.0.0:9876 in 717.19 ms
- Playground hosted at:
 http://0.0.0.0:9876/playground
- Endpoint hosted at:
 http://0.0.0.0:9876/graphql
```

That's it! You can now open [http://localhost:9876/playground](http://localhost:9876/playground) in your browser to see the GraphQL Playground.

You can create a todo by running the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createTodo(data: {title: "Set up Exograph with Neon", completed: true}) {
    id
  }
}
```

To get all todos, try the following query:

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

And you should see the todo you just added. Please follow Exograph's [guide to creating a simple application](https://exograph.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-simple-application) for more details.

## Learn more

In this guide, we have created a basic todo backend using Exograph and Neon. You can extend this further by establishing relationships between types, implementing access control rules, and integrating custom business logic. Check out Exograph's [application tutorial](https://exograph.dev/docs/application-tutorial/overview) for more details.

To deploy Exograph in the cloud and connect it to Neon, follow the guide below (select the "External Database" tab for Neon-specific instructions in each case):

1. Deploying on [Fly.io](https://exograph.dev/docs/deployment/flyio) (these instructions can be adapted to other cloud providers)
2. Deploying on [AWS Lambda](https://exograph.dev/docs/deployment/aws-lambda)


# FerretDB

title: Use FerretDB with Neon
subtitle: Add MongoDB compatibility to your Neon database with FerretDB
enableTableOfContents: true

updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.282Z'
---

FerretDB is an open source document database that adds MongoDB compatibility to other databases, including Postgres. By using FerretDB, developers can access familiar MongoDB features and tools using the same syntax and commands for many of their use cases.

In this guide, you'll learn about FerretDB and how you can add MongoDB compatibility to your Neon Postgres database.

## Advantages of FerretDB

The benefits of using FerretDB include:

- **MongoDB compatibility**

    FerretDB gives you access to the syntax, tools, querying language, and commands available in MongoDB for many common use cases. MongoDB is known for its simple and intuitive NoSQL query language which is widely used by many developers. By using FerretDB, you can enable Postgres databases like Neon to run MongoDB workloads.

    For related information, see [MongoDB Compatibility - What's Really Important?](https://blog.ferretdb.io/mongodb-compatibility-whats-really-important/)

- **Open source**

    As an open source document database, you won't be at risk of vendor lock-in. Since MongoDB's license change to Server Side Public License (SSPL), there's been a lot of confusion regarding what this means for users and what it would mean for their applications. According to the Open Source Initiative â the steward of open source and the set of rules that define open source software â SSPL is not considered open source.

    FerretDB is licensed under Apache 2.0, makes it a good option for users looking for a MongoDB alternative.

- **Multiple backend options**

    FerretDB currently supports Postgres and SQLite backends, with many ongoing efforts to support other backends. Many databases built on Postgres can serve as a backend for FerretDB, including Neon. That means you can take advantage of all the features available in the backend of your choice to scale and manage your database infrastructure without fear of vendor lock-in.

To learn more, see [Understanding FerretDB](https://docs.ferretdb.io/understanding-ferretdb/).

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this guide include the following:

- A Neon account and project. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A database. This guide uses a database named `ferretdb`. It's easy to create a database in Neon. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.
- Docker. For instructions, see [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). To verify your installation or check if you already have Docker installed, you can run `docker --version`.
- The `mongosh` command-line tool. For installation instructions, see [Install mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/). If you are a macOS user, you can quickly install with Homebrew: `brew install mongosh`.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve the connection string for your `ferretdb` database from the **Connection Details** widget.

Your database connection string will look something like this:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/ferretdb
```

## Run FerretDB with Neon via Docker

Execute the following command to run FerretDB in a Docker container and connect it to your Neon Postgres database (`NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`):

```bash shouldWrap
docker run docker run -p 27017:27017 -e FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=<NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING> ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb
```

## Test via mongosh

From another terminal, test to see if the FerretDB instance is connected to your Neon database using `mongosh`. To connect via `mongosh`, you will need a connection string. Use the credentials for your Neon database connection string.

So in this case, the MongoDB connection string will be:

```bash shouldWrap
mongosh 'mongodb://<postgres-username>:<postgres-password>@127.0.0.1/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN'
```

This will connect you directly to the FerretDB instance where you can run MongoDB commands.

```bash
~$ mongosh 'mongodb://<username>:<password>@127.0.0.1/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN'
Current Mongosh Log ID: 657c28296fda6bb93a0c0058

You are now directly connected to your `ferretdb` database.

## Insert documents into FerretDB

With `mongosh`, you can now insert some documents into your FerretDB instance directly from the `ferretdb>` prompt shown above. You are going to insert two basketball player documents into a `players` collection.

```json
db.players.insertMany([
    {
        nba_id: 23,
        player_name: "Jordan",
        player_extended_name: "Michael Jordan",
        quality: "Gold - Legendary",
        overall: 99,
        nationality: "USA",
        position: "SG",
        shooting: 98,
        passing: 85,
        dribbling: 95,
        defense: 93,
        physicality: 92,
        rebounding: 87
    },
    {
        nba_id: 34,
        player_name: "Barkley",
        player_extended_name: "Charles Barkley",
        quality: "Gold - Rare",
        overall: 93,
        nationality: "USA",
        position: "PF",
        shooting: 86,
        passing: 76,
        dribbling: 78,
        defense: 88,
        physicality: 94,
        rebounding: 95,
        base_id: 332
    }
]);
```

Now, when you run `db.players.find()`, it should return all the documents stored in the collection:

```json
ferretdb> db.players.find()
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('65a1b5d53d6122d2b5122e41'),
    nba_id: 34,
    player_name: 'Barkley',
    player_extended_name: 'Charles Barkley',
    quality: 'Gold - Rare',
    overall: 93,
    nationality: 'USA',
    position: 'PF',
    shooting: 86,
    passing: 76,
    dribbling: 78,
    defense: 88,
    physicality: 94,
    rebounding: 95,
    base_id: 332
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('65a1b5d53d6122d2b5122e40'),
    nba_id: 23,
    player_name: 'Jordan',
    player_extended_name: 'Michael Jordan',
    quality: 'Gold - Legendary',
    overall: 99,
    nationality: 'USA',
    position: 'SF',
    shooting: 98,
    passing: 85,
    dribbling: 95,
    defense: 93,
    physicality: 92,
    rebounding: 87
  }
]

```

## Update a record in FerretDB

Next, you need to update the "Jordan" record to reflect his current position as a `SF`. To do this, we can just run an `updateOne` command to target just that particular player:

```json
db.players.updateOne(
    { player_name: "Jordan" },
    { $set: { position: "SF" } }
);
```

Query the collection to see if the changes have been made:

```json
ferretdb> db.players.find({player_name: "Jordan"})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('65a1b5d53d6122d2b5122e40'),
    nba_id: 23,
    player_name: 'Jordan',
    player_extended_name: 'Michael Jordan',
    quality: 'Gold - Legendary',
    overall: 99,
    nationality: 'USA',
    position: 'SF',
    shooting: 98,
    passing: 85,
    dribbling: 95,
    defense: 93,
    physicality: 92,
    rebounding: 87
  }
]
```

You can run many MongoDB operations on FerretDB. See the list of [supported commands](https://docs.ferretdb.io/reference/supported-commands/) in the FerretDB documentation.

## View your database on Neon

In addition to a document database view of the collection in FerretDB, you can also view and query the data in Neon.

To view your current documents, go to the Neon **Dashboard** and select **Tables** from the sidebar. Then, from the **Schema** menu, select `ferretdb`. FerretDB stores the documents in Postgres as [JSONB](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) data.

![FerretDB table showing player data](/docs/guides/ferretdb_table.png)

To query the data for a specific player via SQL, you can do so via the [Neon SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or an SQL client like [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor):

```sql
SELECT _jsonb
FROM ferretdb.players_a90eae09
WHERE _jsonb ->> 'player_name' = 'Jordan';
```

## Get started with FerretDB

FerretDB lets you run MongoDB workloads on relational databases. This flexibility means you can easily add MongoDB compatibility to your Neon Postgres database while avoiding vendor lock-in and retaining control of your data architecture.

To get started with FerretDB, check out the [FerretDB Get Started](https://docs.ferretdb.io/quickstart-guide/) docs.

title: Use Grafbase Edge Resolvers with Neon
subtitle: Learn how to build and deploy serverless GraphQL backends with Grafbase and
  Neon
enableTableOfContents: true

_This guide was contributed by Josep Vidal from Grafbase_

Grafbase allows you to combine your data sources into a centralized GraphQL endpoint and deploy a serverless GraphQL backend.

This guide describes how to create a GraphQL API using Grafbase and use Grafbase [Edge Resolvers](https://grafbase.com/docs/edge-gateway/resolvers) with the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to interact with your Neon database at the edge.

The example project in this guide simulates a marketplace of products, where the product price is dynamically calculated based on data retrieved from your Neon database.

## Prerequisites

- The [Grafbase CLI](https://grafbase.com/cli)
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a backend with Grafbase

1. Create a directory and initialize your Grafbase project by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    npx grafbase init grafbase-neon
    cd grafbase-neon
    ```

2. In your project directory, open the `grafbase/schema.graphql` file and replace the existing content with the following schema:

    ```graphql
    extend type Mutation {
      addProductVisit(productId: ID!): ID! @resolver(name: "add-product-visit")
    }

    type Product @model {
      name: String!
      price: Float @resolver(name: "product/price")
    }
    ```

## Create the schema in Neon

1. Navigate to the Neon Console and select your project.
2. Open the Neon **SQL Editor** and run the following `CREATE TABLE` statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE product_visits(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, product_id TEXT NOT NULL);
    ```

    The `product_visits` table stores product page view data that the application uses to dynamically calculate a product price.

## Create the resolver files

The schema includes an `addProductVisit` query and `prodcut/price` field. Create resolvers for those by creating the following files in your project directory:

- `grafbase/resolvers/add-product-visit.js`
- `grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js`

You can use the following commands to create the files:

```bash
cd grafbase
mkdir resolvers
cd resolvers
touch add-product-visit.js
mkdir product 
cd product
touch price.js
```

You will add code to these files in a later step.

## Install the Neon serverless driver

Inside the `grafbase` directory in your project, run the following commands to install the Neon serverless driver:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  npm init -y
  npm install @neondatabase/serverless
  ```

## Retrieve your Neon connection string

A database connection string is required to forward queries to your Neon database. To retrieve the connection string for your database:

1. Navigate to the Neon **Dashboard**.
2. Copy the connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget. The connection string should appear similar to the following:

    ```text shouldWrap
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

3. Add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your `grafbase/.env` file and set the value to your connection string. For example:

    ```text shouldWrap
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

## Add code to the resolvers

1. In the `resolvers/product/add-product-visit` resolver, add the following code, which inserts a new record in the `product_visits` table with a `productId` each time the resolver is queried.

    ```javascript
    # grafbase/resolvers/add-product-visit.js
    import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

    export default async function Resolver(_, { productId }) {
      const client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

      await client.connect()
      await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO product_visits (product_id) VALUES ('${productId}')`
      )
      await client.end()

      return productId
    }
    ```

2. In the `grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js` resolver, add the following code, which calculates the product price based on the number of product visits (the number of visits represents customer interest in the product).

    ```javascript
    # grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js
    import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

    export default async function Resolver({ id }) {
      const client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
      await client.connect()

      const {
        rows: [{ count }]
      } = await client.query(
        `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_visits WHERE product_id = '${id}'`
      )
      await client.end()

      return Number.parseInt(count)
    }
    ```

## Test the resolvers

To test the resolvers with Neon, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Grafbase CLI:

    ```bash
    npx grafbase dev
    ```

2. Go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and execute the following GraphQL mutation, which creates a new product:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      productCreate(input: { name: "Super Product" }) {
        product {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Use the product `id` to execute the following mutation, which adds a row to the database table in Neon:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      addProductVisit(productId: "PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID")
    }
    ```

4. Query the same product, and check the price:

    ```graphql
    query {
      product(input: { by: "PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID" }) {
        id
        name
        price
      }
    }
    ```

5. Run the query several more times and watch how the price increases as "interest" in the product increases.

_This guide was contributed by Roy Derks from StepZen_

GraphQL has been around for years and is becoming increasingly popular among web developers. It is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data. GraphQL allows clients to access data flexibly and efficiently. However, building a GraphQL API often requires writing a lot of code and familiarizing yourself with a new framework. This guide shows how you can generate a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes using [StepZen](https://stepzen.com/).

Why use Neon and StepZen together? Neon is serverless Postgres. Neon separates storage and compute to offer modern developer features such as scale-to-zero and database branching. With Neon, you can be up and running with a Postgres database in just a few clicks, and you can easily create and manage your database in the Neon Console and connect to it using [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). What if you want to let clients consume your data through an API in a way that is both flexible and efficient? That's where StepZen comes in. StepZen is a GraphQL API platform that lets you build a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes. Just like Neon, it's serverless and offers a generous free tier.

## Set up Neon

Before generating a GraphQL API, you must set up a Neon database, which you can do it in a few steps:

1. Sign in to Neon, or [sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up) if you do not yet have an account.
2. Select a Neon project. If you do not have one, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
3. [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) or use the ready-to-use `dbname` database.

You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

Using the connection string, you can seed the database with the data from the `init.sql` file, which you can find [here](https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples/blob/main/with-neon/init.sql).

Running the `init.sql` file creates the `address`, `customer`, `product`, and `order` tables and populates them with the data. It also creates tables that connect the `customer` table with the `address` table, and the `order` table with the `product` table.

You can seed the database directly from the terminal by running the following `psql` command:

```bash shouldWrap
psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname] < init.sql
```

The command takes a Neon connection string as the first argument and a file as the second argument.

In the terminal, you can see that the tables are created and populated with the data. You can also view the tables and data from the **Tables** page in the Neon Console.

![Neon database seeded with data](/docs/guides/stepzen_tables_view.png)

Next, you will connect StepZen to the Neon database and use it to generate a GraphQL schema for the database.

## Connect StepZen to Neon

To generate a GraphQL schema for the data in your Neon database, you need to connect StepZen to Neon. This can be done manually or by using the StepZen CLI.

The StepZen CLI can be installed with `npm` (or Yarn), and it must be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g stepzen
```

After you install the CLI, create a StepZen account. You can do this by navigating to [https://stepzen.com/](https://stepzen.com) and clicking the **Start for Free** button.

To link your StepZen account to the CLI, log in using the following command:

```bash
stepzen login
```

<Admonition type="note">
You can also use StepZen without creating an account. The difference is that you will have a public account, which means that your schema will be public, and everyone with the link can query data from your database. For more information, refer to the [StepZen documentation](https://stepzen.com/docs/quick-start/install-and-setup).
</Admonition>

Next, create a local directory for your StepZen workspace and navigate to the directory. For example:

```bash
mkdir stpezen
cd stepzen
```

Specify your data source with the `stepzen import` CLI. Answer the setup questions as shown below.

```bash
stepzen import postgresql

? What would you like your endpoint to be called? api/with-neon
? What is your host? YOUR_NEON_HOST:5432 (e.g., `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432`)
? What is your database name? YOUR_NEON_DATABASE (e.g., `dbname`)
? What is the username? YOUR_NEON_USERNAME (e.g., `alex`)
? What is the password? [hidden] YOUR_NEON_PASSWORD
? Automatically link types based on foreign key relationships using @materializer
 (https://stepzen.com/docs/features/linking-types) Yes
? What is your database schema (leave blank to use defaults)?

Starting... done
Successfully imported schema postgresql from StepZen
```

The CLI has now created a GraphQL schema based on the tables and data in your Neon database. You can find the schema in the `stepzen` folder at the root of your project. The schema is generated in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file.

<Admonition type="note">
The **Automatically link types based on foreign key relationships using @materializer** step is essential, as it automatically links the tables based on foreign key relationships, which allows you to query data from the `customer` table and get related data from the `address` table.
</Admonition>

The `config.yaml` file stores connection details for the Neon database. The StepZen CLI uses this file to connect to the Neon database. But you need to make two changes to the file:

```bash
configurationset:
  - configuration:
      name: postgresql_config
      uri: YOUR_NEON_DSN?user=YOUR_NEON_USERNAME&password=YOUR_NEON_PASSWORD&options=project=YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID&sslmode=require
```

As shown above, you need to append `&options=project=YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID` to the `uri` connection string. This is needed to establish a secure connection to the Neon database. The `project` option is the ID of the project in Neon. You can find the project ID in the Neon Console under **Project settings** or in the URL of your project.

The next section explores the GraphQL API to see how the connection between the Neon Postgres database and StepZen works.

## Explore the GraphQL API

The GraphQL schema that StepZen generates still needs to be deployed to the cloud before you are able to explore the GraphQL API. With StepZen, you have multiple options to deploy your schema. You can deploy it to the StepZen cloud or run it locally using Docker. This guide uses the StepZen cloud, which the fastest way to get started.

To deploy the schema to the StepZen cloud, run the following command:

```bash
stepzen start
```

After the schema is deployed, you can explore the GraphQL API in the [StepZen dashboard](https://dashboard.stepzen.com/explorer).

From the dashboard, you can view the GraphQL schema, try out queries and mutations, and generate code snippets for your favorite programming language.

The CLI also outputs the URL of your GraphQL API endpoint. You can use this endpoint to query your API from other tools or applications.

It's time to start querying the GraphQL API. Start by querying the `customer` table. You can do this by writing the following query on the left-hand side of the dashboard:

```graphql
{
  getCustomerList {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The GraphQL API will retrieve the `name` and `email` fields from the `customer` table. The result looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getCustomerList": [
      {
        "name": "Lucas Bill",
        "email": "lucas.bill@example.com"
      },
      {
        // ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In GraphQL, the result has the same shape as the query (or other operation) you used to retrieve it. The GraphQL API will only retrieve the fields from the database that are present in the query. The query sent to the Neon database has the following shape:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer
```

The following section dives deeper into the GraphQL API, showing how GraphQL API queries are translated to SQL.

## From GraphQL query to SQL

You have explored the GraphQL API, learning how to query data from the Neon database. But how does this work? How is a GraphQL query translated to an SQL query that runs on your Neon database?

In the previous example, StepZen only requests the fields in the query, improving the GraphQL API's performance. Requesting all fields from the database makes no sense if only a few are requested.

Below, you can see a snippet of the `getCustomerList` query in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file:

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomerList: [Customer]
    @dbquery(
      type: "postgresql"
      schema: "public"
      table: "customer"
      configuration: "postgresql_config"
    )
}
```

The `getCustomerList` query defined in the GraphQL schema returns an array of the type `Customer`.

- The `@dbquery` directive identifies the query as a database query
- `type` defines the type of database
- `schema` defines the schema
- `table` defines the table in the database
- `configuration` defines the name of the connection configuration used to connect to the database

Earlier, the CLI created connections based on foreign key relationships. For example, the `order` table has a foreign key relationship with the `customer` table. This means that you can query data from the `order` table, and get the related data from the `customer` table. You can query the customer linked to an order like this:

```graphql
{
  getOrderList {
    id
    shippingcost
    customer {
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to the `id` and `shippingcost` fields, the `name` and `email` fields are requested from the `customer` table. So how does the query get the `customer` field?

The `getOrderList` query is defined in the GraphQL schema, and returns a list of the type `Order` with a field called `customerid`. This relationship is defined as a foreign key in the database and the GraphQL schema has a field called `customer`, which is linked to the `customerid` field.

```graphql
type Order {
  carrier: String
  createdat: Date!
  customer: Customer
    @materializer(
      query: "getCustomer"
      arguments: [{ name: "id", field: "customerid" }]
    )
  customerid: Int!
  id: Int!
  lineitemList: [Lineitem] @materializer(query: "getLineitemUsingOrderid")
  shippingcost: Float
  trackingid: String
}
```

The `@materializer` directive links the `customer` field to the `customerid` field. The `query` argument is the name of the query that retrieves the data, which in this case is `getCustomer`. The `arguments` argument is an array of objects that define the arguments passed to the query. In this case, the `id` argument is passed to the `getCustomer` query, and the value of the `id` argument is the value of the `customerid` field.

When you retrieve a list of orders from the database, you can include the `customer` field for each order. StepZen then executes the `getCustomer` query with the `id` argument set to the value of the `customerid` field.

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomer(id: Int!): Customer
    @dbquery(
      type: "postgresql"
      schema: "public"
      table: "customer"
      configuration: "postgresql_config"
    )
}
```

This GraphQL query is translated to the following SQL query, which is run on the Neon Postgres database.

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer WHERE id = $1
```

And together with the previous query, it is translated to the following SQL query for the Neon Postgres database:

```sql
SELECT id, shippingcost, customerid FROM public.order
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer WHERE id = $1
```

StepZen reuses SQL queries or merges queries when possible to retrieve data from the Neon database more efficiently. For example, if you request the `customer` field for multiple orders, StepZen only executes the `getCustomer` query once for every recurring value of `customerid`.

<Admonition type="note">
In addition to having StepZen generate the query that is sent to the Neon database, you can also define a raw query in the GraphQL schema. Defining a raw query is useful when you want to query data from multiple tables or when you want to use a more complex query. You can find an example in the `getOrderUsingCustomerid` query in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file.
</Admonition>

## Conclusion

In this guide, you have learned how to generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database. You have used StepZen, which offers GraphQL-as-a-Service and a CLI to generate GraphQL APIs from data sources such as databases and REST APIs. Using StepZen, you can quickly generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database and use it to query data from the database. You also looked at how StepZen translates queries to the GraphQL API into SQL queries that run on your Neon database.

You can find the complete code example [here](https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples).

_This guide was contributed by the team at WunderGraph_

WunderGraph is an open-source Backend for Frontend (BFF) framework designed to optimize developer workflows through API composition. Developers can use this framework to compose multiple APIs into a single unified interface and generate typesafe API clients that include authentication and file uploads. This guide shows how you can pair WunderGraph with your Neon database to accelerate application development.

With WunderGraph, you can easily introspect your data sources and combine them within your virtual graph. WunderGraph treats APIs as dependencies. You can easily turn your Neon database into a GraphQL API or expose it via JSON-RPC or REST. With an easy-to-deploy Postgres database like Neon, you can now have a 100% serverless stack and build your own stateful serverless apps on the edge.

This guide demonstrates setting up a full-stack app with Neon and WunderGraph, securely exposing Neon to your Next.js frontend in under 15 minutes. While WunderGraph and Neon are compatible with a variety of frontend clients, this demo focuses on using Next.js.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A [WunderGraph Cloud](https://cloud.wundergraph.com/) account
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Installation

Sign into [WunderGraph Cloud](https://cloud.wundergraph.com/) and follow these steps:

1. Click **New Project**.
2. Choose the `NEXT.js` template and give your repository a name.
3. Select the region closest to you.
4. Click **Deploy**.

The deployment will take a few moments.

### Add sample data to Neon

While the project is deploying, add some sample data to your Neon database.

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/) and select **SQL Editor** from the sidebar.
2. Run the following SQL statements to add the sample data.

```sql
create table if not exists Users (
 id serial primary key not null,
 email text not null,
 name text not null,
 unique (email)
);

create table if not exists Messages (
id serial primary key not null,
user_id int not null references Users(id),
message text not null
);

insert into Users (email, name) VALUES ('Jens@wundergraph.com','Jens@WunderGraph');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'Hey, welcome to the WunderGraph!');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'This is WunderGraph!');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'WunderGraph!');

alter table Users add column updatedAt timestamptz not null default now();

alter table Users add column lastLogin timestamptz not null default now();
```

### Connect Neon and Wundergraph

1. Now that your database has some data, navigate back to WunderGraph Cloud.
2. Select the project you just created and navigate to the **Settings** page.
3. Select the **Integrations** tab and click **Connect Neon**.
   ![WunderGraph Settings](/docs/guides/wundergraph_settings.png)
4. You are directed to Neon to authorize WunderGraph. Review the permissions and click **Authorize** to continue.
   You are directed back to WunderGraph Cloud. If you are a part of multiple organizations, you are asked to select the organization to connect with Neon.
5. Select the Neon project and WunderGraph project that you want to connect, and click **Connect Projects**.
   ![WunderGraph connect projects](/docs/guides/wundergraph_connect_projects.png)

Your Neon and Wundergraph projects are now connected.

<Admonition type="important">
WunderGraph creates a role named `wundergraph-$project_id` in the Neon project that you selected during the integration process. Please do not delete or change the password for this role.

WunderGraph configures a environment variable called `NEON_DATABASE_URL`. Please use this variable wherever you need to provide a database URL.
</Admonition>

## Set up the WunderGraph project locally

The following steps describe how to set up your Wundergraph project locally and configure access to Neon.

1. In WunderGraph Cloud, select your project and click **View Git repository** to view your WunderGraph project repository.
2. Clone the repository and open it in your IDE. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/wundergraph.git
cd wundergraph
code .
```

3. After the project is cloned, run the following commands in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```

   These commands install the required dependencies and start your project locally.

4. Inside the `.wundergraph` directory, open the `wundergraph.config.ts` file and add Neon as a datasource, as shown below, or simply replace the existing code with this code:

   ```typescript
   import {
     configureWunderGraphApplication,
     introspect,
     authProviders,
     EnvironmentVariable,
   } from '@wundergraph/sdk';
   import operations from './wundergraph.operations';
   import server from './wundergraph.server';

   const spaceX = introspect.graphql({
     apiNamespace: 'spacex',
     url: 'https://spacex-api.fly.dev/graphql/',
   });

   // Add your neon datasource
   const neon = introspect.postgresql({
     apiNamespace: 'neon',
     //Your database URL can be found in the Neon console
     databaseURL: new EnvironmentVariable('NEON_DATABASE_URL'),
   });

   configureWunderGraphApplication({
     // Add neon inside your APIs array
     apis: [spaceX, neon],
     server,
     operations,
     codeGenerators: [
       {
         templates: [...templates.typescript.all],
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

5. Write an operation that turns your Neon database into an API that exposes data that you can pass through the frontend. To do so, navigate to the `operations` folder inside your `.wundergraph` directory and create a new file called `Users.graphql`.

   <Admonition type="info">
   With WunderGraph you can write operations in either GraphQL or TypeScript.
   </Admonition>

   Inside your `Users.graphql` file, add the following code:

   ```graphql
   {
     neon_findFirstusers {
       id
       name
       email
     }
   }
   ```

This operation queries your Neon database using GraphQL and exposes the data via JSON-RPC. In the next section, you will add the operation to the frontend.

## Configure the frontend

This section describes how to configure the frontend application.

1. In your local project, navigate to the `pages` directory and open the `index.tsx` file.
2. In the `index.tsx` file, make the following three changes or replace the existing code with the code shown below:

- Retrieve the data from the `Users` endpoint using the `UseQuery` hook.
- On line 62, update the copy to read: "This is the result of your **Users** Query".
- On line 66, pass the `users` variable through to the frontend.

```typescript
import { NextPage } from 'next';
import { useQuery, withWunderGraph } from '../components/generated/nextjs';

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const dragons = useQuery({
    operationName: 'Dragons',
  });
  // We want to write this hook to get the data from our Users operation
  const users = useQuery({
    operationName: 'Users',
  });

  const refresh = () => {
    dragons.mutate();
  };

```

## Run the application

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 when the application is finished building. If your application runs successfully, you should see the result of your User's operation.
3. To take the setup one step further, commit the changes to your GitHub repository and merge them into your `main` branch.
4. After you merge the changes, navigate to `WunderGraph Cloud` and view out the **Deployments** tab. You should see that a deployment was triggered. Give the deployment a few seconds to finish.
5. When deployment is ready, navigate to the **Operations** tab. You should see the new endpoint that you created and added to your application. Click it to see your data in real time.

## Key takeaways

This guide provided a brief demonstration showcasing the capabilities of Neon and WunderGraph, which enable you to turn your Neon database into an API exposed via JSON-RPC and rapidly deploy fully serverless apps on the edge in a matter of minutes. The power of Neon with WunderGraph lies in simplifying the development process, allowing you to focus on creating valuable and efficient applications.

In under 15 minutes, you were able to:

1. Create a WunderGraph Cloud account
2. Create a Next.js project hosted in a region near you
3. Set up a Neon database with sample data
4. Connect your WunderGraph application with your Neon database
5. Add Neon to your WunderGraph project using a code first approach
6. Write a GraphQL operation to query your Neon database
7. Update the frontend to display the results of your GraphQL operation securely using JSON-RPC
8. Commit your changes and trigger a deployment without a CI/CD pipeline or Devops team
9. View your new operations in real time with real-time metrics

If you had trouble with any of the steps outlined above, refer to the video guide below.

# Schema migration

# Drizzle

---
title: Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Drizzle ORM
subtitle: Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your TypeScript project using Drizzle ORM
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-21T10:15:00.000Z'
---

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a TypeScript-first ORM that connects to all major databases and works across most Javascript runtimes. It provides a simple way to define database schemas and queries in an SQL-like dialect and tools to generate and run migrations. 

This guide shows how to use `Drizzle` with the `Neon` Postgres database in a Typescript project. We'll create a simple Node.js application with `Hono.js` and demonstrate the full workflow of setting up and working with your database using `Drizzle`.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.
2. Select a project or click the `New Project` button to create a new one. 

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Setting up the TypeScript application

### Create a new Hono.js project

We'll create a simple catalog, with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following command in your terminal to set up a new project using `Hono.js`:

```bash
npm create hono@latest neon-drizzle-guide
```

This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to set up a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
create-hono@0.5.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y

create-hono version 0.5.0
â Using target directory â¦ neon-drizzle-guide
â Which template do you want to use? âº nodejs
cloned honojs/starter#main to ./repos/javascript/neon-drizzle-guide
â Do you want to install project dependencies? â¦ yes
â Which package manager do you want to use? âº npm
```

To use Drizzle and connect to the Neon database, we also add the `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` packages to our project, along with the `Neon serverless` driver library.

```bash
cd neon-drizzle-guide && touch .env
npm install drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless
npm install -D drizzle-kit dotenv
```

Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your `.env` file, which you'll use to connect to our Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon console earlier:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Test that the starter `Hono.js` application works by running `npm run dev` in the terminal. You should see the `Hello, Hono!` message when you navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Set up the database schema

Now, we will define the schema for the application using the `Drizzle` ORM. Create a new `schema.ts` file in your `src` directory and add the following code: 

```typescript
// src/schema.ts

import { pgTable, integer, serial, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const authors = pgTable("authors", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  bio: text("bio"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
});

export const books = pgTable("books", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  authorId: integer("author_id").references(() => authors.id),
  created_at: timestamp("created_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
});
```

The code defines two tables: `authors`, which will contain the list of all the authors, and `books`, which will contain the list of books written by the authors. Each book is associated with an author using the `authorId` field.

To generate a migration to create these tables in the database, we'll use the `drizzle-kit` command. Add the following script to the `package.json` file at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:generate": "drizzle-kit generate:pg --schema src/schema.ts --out ./drizzle",
  }
}
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal to generate the migration files:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

This command generates a new folder named `drizzle` containing the migration files for the `authors` and `books` tables. 

### Run the migration

The generated migration file is written in SQL and contains the necessary commands to create the tables in the database. To apply these migrations, we'll use the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) and helper functions provided by the `drizzle-orm` library. 

Create a new `migrate.ts` in your `src` directory and add the following code:

```typescript
// src/migrate.ts

import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
import { migrate } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http/migrator";
import { config } from "dotenv";

config({ path: ".env" });

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const db = drizzle(sql);

const main = async () => {
  try {
    await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: "drizzle" });
    console.log("Migration completed");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during migration:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

main();
```

The `drizzle-orm` package comes with an integration for `Neon`, which allows us to run the migrations using the `migrate` function. Add a new script to the `package.json` file that executes the migration.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:migrate": "tsx ./src/migrate.ts"
  }
}
```

You can now run the migration script using the following command:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

You should see the `Migration completed` message in the terminal, indicating that the migration was successful.

### Seed the database

To test the application works, we need to add some example data to our tables. Create a new file at `src/seed.ts` and add the following code to it:

```typescript
// src/seed.ts

import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
import { authors, books } from "./schema";
import { config } from "dotenv";

config({ path: ".env" });

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const db = drizzle(sql);

async function seed() {
  await db.insert(authors).values([
    {
      name: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
      bio: "The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.",
    },
    {
      name: "George R.R. Martin",
      bio: "The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.",
    },
    {
      name: "J.K. Rowling",
      bio: "The creator of the Harry Potter series.",
    },
  ]);

  const authorRows = await db.select().from(authors);
  const authorIds = authorRows.map((row) => row.id);

  await db.insert(books).values([
    {
      title: "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      authorId: authorIds[0],
    },
    {
      title: "The Two Towers",
      authorId: authorIds[0],
    },
    {
      title: "The Return of the King",
      authorId: authorIds[0],
    },
    {
      title: "A Game of Thrones",
      authorId: authorIds[1],
    },
    {
      title: "A Clash of Kings",
      authorId: authorIds[1],
    },
    {
      title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
      authorId: authorIds[2],
    },
    {
      title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
      authorId: authorIds[2],
    },
  ]);
}

async function main() {
  try {
    await seed();
    console.log("Seeding completed");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during seeding:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

main();
```

This script inserts some seed data into the `authors` and `books` tables. Add a new script to the `package.json` file that runs the seeding program. 

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "tsx ./src/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

Run the seed script using the following command:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

You should see the `Seeding completed` message in the terminal, indicating that the seed data was inserted into the database. 

### Implement the API endpoints

Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. Replace the existing `src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript
// src/index.ts

import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { env } from "hono/adapter";
import { config } from "dotenv";

import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
import { authors, books } from "./schema";

config({ path: ".env" });
const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, this is a catalog of books!");
});

app.get("/authors", async (c) => {
  const { DATABASE_URL } = env<{ DATABASE_URL: string }>(c);
  const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);
  const db = drizzle(sql);

  const output = await db.select().from(authors);
  return c.json(output);
});

app.get("/books/:authorId", async (c) => {
  const { DATABASE_URL } = env<{ DATABASE_URL: string }>(c);
  const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);
  const db = drizzle(sql);

  const authorId = c.req.param("authorId");
  const output = await db
    .select()
    .from(books)
    .where(eq(books.authorId, Number(authorId)));
  return c.json(output);
});

const port = 3000;
console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port,
});
```

This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints: `/authors` and `/books/:authorId`. The `/authors` endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the `/books/:authorId` endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author with the given `authorId`. 

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a `Hono.js` server at `http://localhost:3000`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors` and `http://localhost:3000/books/1` in your browser to check that the API works as expected. 

## Migration after a schema change

To demonstrate how to execute a schema change, we'll add a new column to the `authors` table, listing the country of origin for each author. 

### Generate the new migration

Modify the code in the `src/schema.ts` file to add the new column to the `authors` table:

```typescript
// src/schema.ts

import { pgTable, integer, serial, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const authors = pgTable("authors", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  bio: text("bio"),
  country: text("country"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
});

export const books = pgTable("books", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  authorId: integer("author_id").references(() => authors.id),
  created_at: timestamp("created_at").notNull().defaultNow(),
});
```

Now, we can run the following command to generate a new migration file:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

This command generates a new migration file in the `drizzle` folder, with the SQL command to add the new column to the `authors` table. 

### Run the migration

Run the migration script using the following command:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

You should see the `Migration completed` message in the terminal, indicating it was successful.

### Verify the schema change

To verify that the schema change was successful, run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors` in your browser to check that each author entry has a `country` field, currently set to `null`. 

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a new TypeScript project using `Hono.js` and `Drizzle` ORM and connected it to a `Neon` Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

Flyway is a database migration tool that facilitates version control for databases. It allows developers to manage and track changes to the database schema, ensuring that the database evolves consistently across different environments.

This guide steps you through installing the Flyway command-line tool, configuring Flyway to connect to a Neon database, and running database migrations. The guide follows the setup described in the [Flyway command-line quickstart](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/quickstart-command-line-184127576.html).

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A Neon project. See [Create your first project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).
- A database. This guide uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database. You can create your own database if you like. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Download and extract Flyway

1. Download the latest version of the [Flyway command-line tool](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/command-line-184127404.html).

2. Extract the Flyway files. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    tar -xzvf flyway-commandline-x.y.z-linux-x64.tar.gz -C ~/
    ```

3. Open a command prompt to view the contents of your Flyway installation:

    ```bash
    cd ~/flyway-x.y.z
    ls
    assets  drivers  flyway.cmd  jre  licenses    rules
    conf    flyway   jars        lib  README.txt  sql
    ```

## Set your path variable

Add the Flyway directory to your `PATH` so that you can execute Flyway commands from any location.

<CodeTabs labels={["bash", "zsh"]}>

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/flyway-x.y.z' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/flyway-x.y.x' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</CodeTabs>

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve your password and a Java connection string from the **Connection Details** widget.

Your Java connection string should look something like this:

```bash shouldWrap
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
```

## Configure flyway

To configure Flyway to connect to your Neon database, create a `flyway.conf` file in the /conf directory. Include the following items, modified to use the connection details you retrieved in the previous step.

```bash shouldWrap
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb

flyway.user=alex

flyway.password=AbC123dEf

flyway.locations=filesystem:/home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql
```

## Create the first migration

Create an `sql` directory to hold your first migration file. We'll name the file `V1__Create_person_table.sql` and include the following command, which creates a person table in your database.

```bash
create table person (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

## Migrate the database

Run the `flyway migrate` command to migrate your database:

```bash
flyway migrate
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:sqlite:FlywayQuickStartCLI.db (SQLite 3.41)
Successfully validated 1 migration (execution time 00:00.008s)
Creating Schema History table: "PUBLIC"."flyway_schema_history"
Current version of schema "PUBLIC": << Empty Schema >>
Migrating schema "PUBLIC" to version 1 - Create person table
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "PUBLIC" (execution time 00:00.033s)
```

To verify that the `person` table was created, you can view it on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## Add a second migration

Run another migration to add data to the table. Add a second migration file to the `/sql` directory called `V2__Add_people.sql` and add the following statements:

```bash
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (1, 'Alex');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (2, 'Mr. Lopez');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (3, 'Ms. Smith');
```

Run the migration:

```bash
flyway migrate
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-red-credit-85617375.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Successfully validated 2 migrations (execution time 00:00.225s)
Current version of schema "public": 1
Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - Add people"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "public", now at version v2 (execution time 00:00.388s)
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql/report.html
```

You can verify that the data was added by viewing the table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## View your schema migration history

When you run the `flyway migrate` command, Flyway registers the schema changes in the `flyway_schema_history` table, which Flyway automatically creates in your database. You can view the table by running the [flyway info](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/command-line-info-184127413.html) command.

```bash
flyway info
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-red-credit-85617375.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Schema version: 2
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
| Category  | Version | Description         | Type | Installed On        | State   | Undoable |
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
| Versioned | 1       | Create person table | SQL  | 2023-10-22 19:00:39 | Success | No       |
| Versioned | 2       | Add people          | SQL  | 2023-10-22 19:04:42 | Success | No       |
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql/report.html
```

You can also view the table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

# Manage multiple environments

title: Manage multiple database environments
subtitle: Learn how to manage schemas for multiple database environments with Flyway
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.282Z'

With Flyway, you can manage and track changes to your database schema, ensuring that the database evolves consistently across different environments.

When automating releases, there are often multiple environments or a chain of environments that you must deliver changes to in a particular order. Such environments might include _development_, _staging_, and _production_.

In this guide, we'll show you how to use Neon's branching feature to spin up a branch for each environment and how to configure Flyway to manage schema changes across those environments.

## Prerequisites

- A flyway installation. See [Get started with Flyway and Neon](/docs/guides/flyway) for installation instructions.
- A Neon account and project. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A database. This guide uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database on the `main` branch of your Neon project. You can create your own database if you like. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Add a table to your database

Set up a database to work with by adding a table to your `neondb` database on the `main` branch of your Neon project. If you completed [Get started with Flyway and Neon](/docs/guides/flyway), you might already have this `person` table created. We'll consider this your _production_ environment database.

If you still need to create the `person` table, open the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), and run the following statement:

```bash
create table person (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

## Create databases for development and staging

Using Neon's branching feature, create your _development_ and _staging_ databases. When you create a branch in Neon, you are creating a copy-on-write clone of the parent branch that incudes all databases and roles that exist on the parent, and each branch is an isolated Postgres instance with its own compute resources.

Perform these steps twice, once for your _development_ branch and once for your _staging_ branch.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
4. Enter a name for the branch. For example, name the branch for the environment (_development_ or _staging_).
5. Select a parent branch. This should be the branch where you created the `person` table.
6. Leave the other default settings and click **Create Branch**.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

```bash showLineNumbers
neonctl branches create --name development
```

```bash showLineNumbers
curl --request POST \

  },
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "type": "read_only"
    }
  ]
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When you are finished, you should have a _development_ branch and a _staging_ branch.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection strings

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve the connection string for each branch (`main`, `development`, and `staging`) from the **Connection Details** widget. Use the **Branch** drop-down menu to select each branch before copying the connection string.

Your connection strings should look something like the ones shown below. Note that the hostname differs for each (the part starting with `ep-` and ending with `aws.neon.tech`). That's because each branch is hosted on its own compute instance.

- **main**

    ```bash shouldWrap
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

- **development**

    ```bash shouldWrap
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-mute-night-47642501.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

- **staging**

    ```bash shouldWrap
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-shrill-shape-27763949.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

## Configure flyway to connect each environment

To enable Flyway to connect to multiple environments, we'll create a configuration file for each environment and add the environment-specific connection details. When running Flyway, you'll specify the configuration file to be used.

<Admonition type="note">
By default, Flyway loads its configuration from the default `conf/flyway.conf` file. This is true even if you specify another configuration file when running Flyway. You can take advantage of this behavior by defining non-environment specific configuration settings in the default `conf/flyway.conf` file, and placing your environment-specific settings in separate configuration files, as we'll do here.
</Admonition>

1. Switch to your Flyway `/conf` directory and create the following configuration files, one for each environment, by copying the default configuration file. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/flyway-x.y.z/conf
    cp flyway.conf env_dev.conf
    cp flyway.conf env_staging.conf
    cp flyway.conf env_prod.conf
    ```

2. In each configuration file, update the following items with the correct connection details for that database environment. The `url` setting will differ for each environment (in `env_prod.conf`, the `url` will point to `main`). In this example, where you are the only user, the `user` and `password` settings should be the same for each of your three database environments.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb

    flyway.user=alex

    flyway.password=AbC123dEf

    flyway.locations=filesystem:/home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql

    flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true
    ```

    - The `flyway.locations` setting tells Flyway where to look for your migration files. We'll create them in the `/sql` directory in a later step.
    - The `flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true` setting tells Flyway to perform a baseline action when you run the `migrate` command on a non-empty schema with no Flyway schema history table. The schema will then be initialized with the `baselineVersion` before executing migrations. Only migrations above the `baselineVersion` will then be applied. This is useful for initial Flyway deployments on projects with an existing database. You can disable this setting by commenting it out again or setting it to false after applying your first migration on the database.

## Create a migration

Create a migration file called `V2__Add_people.sql`, add it to your Flyway `/sql` directory, and add the following statements to the file:

```bash
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (1, 'Alex');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (2, 'Mr. Lopez');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (3, 'Ms. Smith');
```

### Run the migration on each environment

Run the migration on each environment in order by specifying the environment's configuration file in the `flyway migrate` command. You'll start with your `development` environment, then `staging`, and then finally, `production`.

<Tabs labels={["Development", "Staging", "Production"]}>

<TabItem>

```bash showLineNumbers
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_dev.conf"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

```bash showLineNumbers
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_staging.conf"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

```bash showLineNumbers
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_prod.conf"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

A successful migration command returns output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-nameless-unit-49929920.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Schema history table "public"."flyway_schema_history" does not exist yet
Successfully validated 1 migration (execution time 00:00.199s)
Creating Schema History table "public"."flyway_schema_history" with baseline ...
Successfully baselined schema with version: 1
Current version of schema "public": 1
Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - Add people"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "public", now at version v2 (execution time 00:00.410s)
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/report.html
```

After you run the migration commands, your database should be consistent across all three environments. You can verify that the data was added to each database by viewing the branch and table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## Conclusion

You've seen how you can instantly create new database environment with Neon's branching feature and how to keep schemas consistent across different environments using Flyway. The steps in this guide were performed manually from the command line but could be easily integrated into your release management pipeline. Neon provides a [CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli) and [API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) for automating various tasks in Neon, such as branch creation, which you can also integrate into your release automation.

- A Neon project. See [Create your first project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).
- Liquibase requires Java. For Liquibase Java requirements, see [Requirements](https://docs.liquibase.com/start/install/liquibase-requirements.html). To check if you have Java installed, run `java --version`, or `java -version` on macOS`.

## Download and extract Liquibase

1. Download the Liquibase CLI from [https://www.liquibase.com/download](https://www.liquibase.com/download).

2. Extract the Liquibase files. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    mkdir ~/liquibase
    tar -xzvf liquibase-x.yy.z.tar.gz -C ~/liquibase/
    ```

3. Open a command prompt to view the contents of your Liquibase installation:

    ```bash
    cd ~/liquibase
    ls
    ABOUT.txt      GETTING_STARTED.txt  licenses     liquibase.bat
    changelog.txt  internal             LICENSE.txt  README.txt
    examples       lib                  liquibase    UNINSTALL.txt
    ```

## Set your path variable

Add the Liquibase directory to your `PATH` so that you can run Liquibase commands from any location.

<CodeTabs labels={["bashrc", "profile", "zsh"]}>

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</CodeTabs>

## Verify your installation

Verify that the Liquibase installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
liquibase --version
...
Liquibase Version: x.yy.z
Liquibase Open Source x.yy.z by Liquibase
```

## Prepare a Neon database

For demonstration purposes, create a `blog` database in Neon with two tables, `posts` and `authors`.

1. Open the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
1. Select your project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar and create a database named `blog`. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
1. Using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), add the following tables:

    ```sql
    -- Creating the `authors` table
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(100),
        last_name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        bio TEXT
    );

    -- Creating the `posts` table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id),
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        content TEXT,
        published_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve your password and a Java connection string from the **Connection Details** widget. Use the selection drop-down menu.

Your Java connection string should look something like the one shown below.

```bash shouldWrap
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
```

## Connect from Liquibase to your Neon database

1. Create a directory for your Liquibase project. For example:

    ```bash
    mkdir blogdb
    ```

2. Change to your project directory and create a `liquibase.properties` file.

    ```bash
    cd blogdb
    touch liquibase.properties
    ```

3. Open the the `liquibase.properties` file in an editor and add entries for a [liquibase changelog file](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/home.html) and your database `url`. We'll call the changelog file `dbchangelog.xml`. You will use this file to define schema changes. For the `url`, specify the Neon connection string you retrieved previously.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    changeLogFile:dbchangelog.xml  
    url: jdbc:postgresql://ep-floral-poetry-66238369.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user=alex&password=4GfNAqycba8P&sslmode=require
    ```

## Take a snapshot of your database

In this step, you will run the [generateChangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/inspection/generate-changelog.html) command in your project directory to create a changelog file with the current state of your database. We'll call this file `mydatabase_changelog.xml`.

```bash
liquibase --changeLogFile=mydatabase_changelog.xml generateChangeLog
```

Youâll get a changelog file for your database that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<databaseChangeLog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog" xmlns:ext="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext" xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-ext.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-latest.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-latest.xsd">
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-1">
        <createTable tableName="authors">
            <column autoIncrement="true" name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="authors_pkey"/>
            </column>
            <column name="first_name" type="VARCHAR(100)"/>
            <column name="last_name" type="VARCHAR(100)"/>
            <column name="email" type="VARCHAR(255)">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="bio" type="TEXT"/>
        </createTable>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-2">
        <createTable tableName="posts">
            <column autoIncrement="true" name="post_id" type="INTEGER">
                <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="posts_pkey"/>
            </column>
            <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER"/>
            <column name="title" type="VARCHAR(255)">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="content" type="TEXT"/>
            <column defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" name="published_date" type="TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE"/>
        </createTable>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-3">
        <addUniqueConstraint columnNames="email" constraintName="authors_email_key" tableName="authors"/>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-4">
        <addForeignKeyConstraint baseColumnNames="author_id" baseTableName="posts" constraintName="posts_author_id_fkey" deferrable="false" initiallyDeferred="false" onDelete="NO ACTION" onUpdate="NO ACTION" referencedColumnNames="author_id" referencedTableName="authors" validate="true"/>
    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```

## Create a schema change

Now, you can start making database schema changes by creating [changesets](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/changeset.html) and adding them to the database changelog file you defined in your `liquibase.properties` file. A changeset is the basic unit of change in Liquibase.

1. Create the changelog file where you will add your schema changes:

    ```bash
    cd ~/blogdb
    touch dbchangelog.xml
    ```

2. Add the following changeset, which adds a `comments` table to your database. Replace `author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234"` with your auther name and id, which you can retrieve from your changelog file, described in the previous step.

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
    <databaseChangeLog  
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
    xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro"  
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-4.4.xsd
        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-4.5.xsd">
        <changeSet author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234">
            <createTable tableName="comments">
                <column autoIncrement="true" name="comment_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="comments_pkey"/>
                </column>
                <column name="post_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_post_id" referencedTableName="posts" referencedColumnNames="post_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_author_id" referencedTableName="authors" referencedColumnNames="author_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="comment" type="TEXT"/>
                <column name="commented_date" type="TIMESTAMP" defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"/>
            </createTable>
        </changeSet>
    </databaseChangeLog>
    ```

## Deploy your change

Deploy your database schema change by running the [update](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update.html) command:

```bash
liquibase update
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 07:33:53 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
Running Changeset: dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::AlexL

UPDATE SUMMARY
Run:                          1
Previously run:               0
Filtered out:                 0
-------------------------------
Total change sets:            1

Liquibase: Update has been successful. Rows affected: 1
Liquibase command 'update' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

<Admonition type="info">
When you run a changeset for the first time, Liquibase automatically creates two tracking tables in your database:

- [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html): Tracks which changesets have been run.
- [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html): Ensures only one instance of Liquibase runs at a time.

You can verify these tables were created by viewing the `blog` database on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
</Admonition>

## Rollback a change

Try rolling back your last change by running the Liquibase [rollbackCount](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/rollback/rollback-count.html) command:

```bash
liquibase rollbackCount 1
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 07:36:22 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
Rolling Back Changeset: dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::AlexL
Liquibase command 'rollbackCount' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

You can verify that creation of the `comments` table was rolled back viewing the `blog` database on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.

Liquibase is an open-source database-independent library for tracking, managing, and applying database schema changes. To learn more about Liquibase, refer to the [Liquibase documentation](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html).

This guide shows how to set up a developer workflow using Liquibase with Neon's branching feature. The workflow involves making schema changes to a database on a development branch and applying those changes back to the source database on the main branch of your Neon project.

The instructions in this guide are based on the workflow described in the [Liquibase Developer Workflow](https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/developer-workflow) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A Neon project. See [Create your first project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).
- Liquibase requires Java. For Liquibase Java requirements, see [Requirements](https://docs.liquibase.com/start/install/liquibase-requirements.html). To check if you have Java installed, run `java --version`, or `java -version` on macOS`.
- An installation of Liquibase. For instructions, refer to [Get started with Liquibase and Neon](/docs/guides/liquibase).

## Initialize a new Liquibase project

Run the [init project](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/init/project.html) command to initialize a Liquibase project in the specified directory. The project directory is created if it does not exist. Initializing a Liquibase project in this way provides you with a pre-populated Liquibase properties file, which we'll modify in a later step.

```bash
liquibase init project --project-dir ~/blogdb
```

Enter `Y` to accept the defaults.

## Prepare a source database

For demonstration purposes, create a `blog` database in Neon with two tables, `posts` and `authors`.

1. Open the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
1. Select your project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar and create a database named `blog`. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
1. Using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), add the following tables:

    ```sql
    -- Creating the `authors` table
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(100),
        last_name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        bio TEXT
    );

    -- Creating the `posts` table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id),
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        content TEXT,
        published_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

## Prepare a development database

Now, let's prepare a development database in Neon by creating a development branch, where you can safely make changes to your database schema without affecting the source database on your `main` branch. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of the data in your Neon project, so it will include a copy of the `blog` database with the `authors` and `posts` tables that you just created.

To create a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**. You will see your `main` branch, where you just created your `blog` database and tables.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
4. Enter a name for the branch. Let's call it `dev1`.
5. Leave `main` selected as the parent branch. This is where you created the `blog` database.
6. Leave the remaining default settings. Creating a branch from **Head** creates a branch with the latest data, and a compute endpoint is required to connect to the database on the branch.
8. Click **Create Branch** to create your branch.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection strings

From the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects), select your project and retrieve connection strings for your target and source databases from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

<Admonition type="note">
The target database is the database on your `dev1` branch where you will will do your development work. Your source database is where you will apply your schema changes later, once you are satisfied with the changes on your development branch.
</Admonition>

1. Select the `dev1` branch, the `blog` database, and copy the connection string.

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog
    ```

2. Select the `main` branch, the `blog` database, and copy the connection string.

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog
    ```

Be careful not to mix up your connection strings. You'll see that the hostname (the part starting with `-ep` and ending in `neon.tech`) differs. This is because the `dev1` branch is a separate instance of Postgres, hosted on its own compute.

## Update your liquibase.properties file

The `liquibase.properties` file defines the location of the Liquibase changelog file and your target and source databases.

1. From your Liquibase project directory, open the `liquibase.properties` file, which comes pre-populated with example settings.

2. Change the `changeLogFile` setting as shown:

    ```bash
    changeLogFile=dbchangelog.xml
    ``````

    The [changelog file](https://docs.liquibase.com/parameters/changelog-file.html) is where you define database schema changes (changesets).

3. Change the target database `url`, `username`, and `password` settings to the correct values for the `blog` database on your `dev1` branch. You can obtain the required details from the connection string you copied previously. You will need to swap out the hostname (`ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`), username, and password for your own.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    liquibase.command.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog

    liquibase.command.username: alex

    liquibase.command.password: AbC123dEf
    ```

4. Change the source database settings to the correct values for the `blog` database on your `main` branch. The username and password will be the same as your `dev1` branch, but make sure to use the right hostname. Copy the snippet below and replace the hostname (`ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`), username, and password for your own.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    liquibase.command.referenceUrl: jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog

    liquibase.command.referenceUsername: alex

    liquibase.command.referencePassword: AbC123dEf
    ```

## Take a snapshot of your target database

Capture the current state of your target database. The following command creates a Liquibase changelog file named `mydatabase_changelog.xml`.

```bash
liquibase --changeLogFile=mydatabase_changelog.xml generateChangeLog
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 09:23:33 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
BEST PRACTICE: The changelog generated by diffChangeLog/generateChangeLog should be inspected for correctness and completeness before being deployed. Some database objects and their dependencies cannot be represented automatically, and they may need to be manually updated before being deployed.
Generated changelog written to mydatabase_changelog.xml
Liquibase command 'generateChangelog' was executed successfully.
```

Check for the `mydatabase_changelog.xml` file in your Liquibase project directory. It should look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```

## Create a schema change

Now, you can start making database schema changes by creating [changesets](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/changeset.html) and adding them to the changelog file you defined in your `liquibase.properties` file. A changeset is the basic unit of change in Liquibase.

1. Create the changelog file where you will add your schema changes:

    ```bash
    cd ~/blogdb
    touch dbchangelog.xml
    ```

2. Add the following changeset to the `dbchangelog.xml` file, which adds a `comments` table to your database:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
    <databaseChangeLog  
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
    xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro"  
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-4.4.xsd
        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-4.5.xsd">
        <changeSet author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234">
            <createTable tableName="comments">
                <column autoIncrement="true" name="comment_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="comments_pkey"/>
                </column>
                <column name="post_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_post_id" referencedTableName="posts" referencedColumnNames="post_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_author_id" referencedTableName="authors" referencedColumnNames="author_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="comment" type="TEXT"/>
                <column name="commented_date" type="TIMESTAMP" defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"/>
            </createTable>
        </changeSet>
    </databaseChangeLog>
    ```

### Deploy the schema change

Run the [update](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update.html) command to deploy the schema change to your target database (your development database on the `dev1` branch).

```bash
liquibase update
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 10:11:35 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
Running Changeset: dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::alex

UPDATE SUMMARY
Run:                          1
Previously run:               0
Filtered out:                 0
-------------------------------
Total change sets:            1

Liquibase: Update has been successful. Rows affected: 1
Liquibase command 'update' was executed successfully.
```

<Admonition type="info">
When you run a changeset for the first time, Liquibase automatically creates two tracking tables in your database:

- [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html): Tracks which changesets have been run.
- [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html): Ensures only one instance of Liquibase runs at a time.

You can verify these tables were created by viewing the `blog` database on your `dev1` branch on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
</Admonition>

At this point, you can continue to iterate, applying schema changes to your database, until you are satisfied with the modified schema.

### Review schema changes

It is a best practice to review schema changes before saving and applying them to your source database.

You can run the [status](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/change-tracking/status.html) command to see if there are any changesets that haven't been applied to the source database. Notice that the command specifies the hostname of the source database:

```bash shouldWrap
liquibase --url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-rapid-bush-01185324.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog status --verbose
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following indicating that there is one changeset that has not been applied to the source database. This is your `comments` table changeset.

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 12:30:51 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase

     dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::alex
Liquibase command 'status' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

### Check your SQL

Before applying the update, you can run the [updateSQL](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update-sql.html) command to inspect the SQL Liquibase will apply when running the update command:

```bash shouldWrap
liquibase --url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-rapid-bush-01185324.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog updateSQL
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following, which confirms that the changeset will create a `comments` table.

### Save your changelog to source control

When you are satisfied with the changes that will be applied, save your changelog to source control, such as a GitHub repository where you or your team stores you changelog.

### Apply the changeset to your source database

Apply the new changesets to the source database on your primary branch:

```bash shouldWrap

To ensure that all changes have been applied to the production database, you can rerun the `status`, `updatedSql`, and `diff` commands you ran above. After applying the change, there should be no differences. You can also check your databases in the **Tables** view in the Neon console to verify that the source database now has a `comments` table.

<Admonition type="note">
When you run a changeset for the first time on the source database, you will find that Liquibase automatically creates the [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html) and [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html) tracking tables that were created in your development database. These tracking tables are created on any database where you apply changesets.

title: Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Prisma ORM
subtitle: Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Javascript project using Prisma ORM
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-03-06T10:15:00.000Z'

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an open-source ORM for Node.js and Typescript, known for its ease of use and focus on type safety. It supports many databases, including Postgres, and provides a robust system for managing database schemas and migrations.

This guide walks you through using `Prisma` ORM with a `Neon` Postgres database in a Javascript project. We'll create a Node.js application, set up Prisma, and show how to run migrations using Prisma.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.
2. Select an existing project or click the `New Project` button to create a new one. 

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use. 

## Setting Up the Node application

### Create a new Node project

We'll create a simple catalog, with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following command in your terminal to set up a new project using `Express.js`:

```bash
mkdir neon-prisma-guide && cd neon-prisma-guide
npm init -y && touch .env index.js 
npm pkg set type="module" && npm pkg set scripts.start="node index.js"
npm install express
```

To use the Prisma ORM for making queries, install the `@prisma/client` package and the Prisma CLI. The CLI is only needed as a development dependency to generate the Prisma Client for the given schema. 

```bash
npm install @prisma/client && npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

These commands create a new `prisma` folder in your project with a `schema.prisma` file, where we will define the database schema for our application. 

### Configure Prisma to Use Neon Database

Open the `prisma/schema.prisma` file and update the `datasource db` block with your Neon database connection details:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your `.env` file, which you'll use to connect to your Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon console earlier:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

### Define the Database schema

In the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, add the following model definitions:

```prisma
model Author {
  @@map("authors")
  
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  bio       String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  books     Book[]
}

model Book {
  @@map("books")
  
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  authorId  Int      @map("author_id")
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  author    Author   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

Two models are defined above: `Author`, which contains information about authors, and `Book`, for details about published books. The `Book` model includes a foreign key that references the `Author` model.

### Generate Prisma client and run migrations

To create and apply migrations based on your schema, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command generates migration files written in SQL corresponding to our schema definitions and applies them to create the tables in your Neon database. We used the `--name` flag to name the migration. 

The command also generates a Prisma Client that is aware of our schemas:

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
```

We'll use this client later to interact with the database.

### Seed the Database

To test that the application works, we need to add some example data to our tables. Create a `seed.js` file in your project and add the following code to it:

```javascript
// seed.js

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const seed = async () => {
  const authors = [
    {
      name: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
      bio: "The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.",
      books: {
        create: [
          { title: "The Hobbit" },
          { title: "The Fellowship of the Ring" },
          { title: "The Two Towers" },
          { title: "The Return of the King" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "George R.R. Martin",
      bio: "The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.",
      books: {
        create: [
          { title: "A Game of Thrones" },
          { title: "A Clash of Kings" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      name: "J.K. Rowling",
      bio: "The creator of the Harry Potter series.",
      books: {
        create: [
          { title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" },
          { title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ];

  for (const author of authors) {
    await prisma.author.create({
      data: author,
    });
  }
}

async function main() {
  try {
    await seed();
    console.log("Seeding completed");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during seeding:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  } finally {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  }
}

main();
```

Run the seed script to populate the database with the initial data:

```bash
node seed.js
```

You should see the `Seeding completed` message in the terminal, indicating that the seed data was inserted into the database. 

### Implementing the API Endpoints

Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. We'll use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), which is a minimal web application framework for Node.js. 

Create an `index.ts` file at the project root, and add the following code to set up your Express server:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World! This is a book catalog.");
});

app.get("/authors", async (req, res) => {
  const authors = await prisma.author.findMany();
  res.json(authors);
});

app.get("/books/:author_id", async (req, res) => {
  const authorId = parseInt(req.params.author_id);
  const books = await prisma.book.findMany({
    where: {
      authorId: authorId
    }
  });
  res.json(books);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints: `/authors` and `/books/:authorId`. The `/authors` endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the `/books/:authorId` endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author with the given `authorId`. 

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors` and `http://localhost:3000/books/1` in your browser to check that the API works as expected.

## Migration after a schema change

To demonstrate how to execute a schema change, we'll add a new column to the `authors` table, listing the country of origin for each author. 

### Update the Prisma model

Modify the `Author` model in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to add the new `country` field:

```prisma

model Author {
  @@map("authors")
  
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  bio       String?
  country   String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  books     Book[]
}
```

### Generate and apply the migration

Run the following command to generate a new migration and apply it to the database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-country
```

This command generates a new migration file to add the new field and applies it to the database. It also updates the Prisma client to reflect the change in the schema. 

### Verify the migration

To verify the migration, run the application again:

```bash
npm run start
```

You can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors` in your browser to check that each author entry has a `country` field, currently set to `null`. 

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a new Javascript project using `Express.js` and `Prisma` ORM and connected it to a `Neon` Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is a promise-based Node.js ORM that supports multiple relational databases. In this guide, we'll explore how to use `Sequelize` ORM with a Neon Postgres database in a JavaScript project. 

We'll create a Node.js application, configure `Sequelize`, and show how to set up and run migrations with `Sequelize`.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.
2. Select an existing project or click the `New Project` button to create a new one. 

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use. 

## Setting Up the Node application

### Create a new Node project

We'll create a simple catalog with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following commands in your terminal to set up a new project using `Express.js`:

```bash
mkdir neon-sequelize-guide && cd neon-sequelize-guide
npm init -y && touch .env index.js 
npm install express dotenv
```

Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the `.env` file, which you'll use to connect to your Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon console earlier:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

To use the `Sequelize` ORM to run queries, we need to install the `sequelize` package and the `pg` driver to connect to Postgres from Node.js. We also need to install the `sequelize-cli` package to manage data models and run migrations. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
npm install sequelize-cli --save-dev
```

### Configure Sequelize

Run the following command to initialize the `sequelize` configuration:

```bash
npx sequelize init
```

This command creates `config`, `migrations`, `models`, and `seeders` directories at the project root. 

The `config` directory contains the `config.json` file, which holds the database configuration. We want to have the database URL read as an environment variable, so we replace it with a `config.js` file. Create a `config.js` file in your `config/` directory and add the following code:

```javascript
// config/config.js

const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

module.exports = {
  development: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    dialect: 'postgres',
    dialectOptions: { ssl: { require: true } }
  }
};
```

To make the `sequelize` CLI aware of the path to the new configuration file, we need to create a `.sequelizerc` file at the project root and add the following code: 

```javascript
// .sequelizerc

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  'config': path.resolve('config', 'config.js')
};
```

### Create models and set up migrations

We'll create an `Author` and a `Book` model to represent the tables in our database. Run the following commands to create the models:

```bash
npx sequelize model:generate --name Author --attributes name:string,bio:string
npx sequelize model:generate --name Book --attributes title:string
```

Sequelize creates a new file for each model in the `models/` directory and a corresponding migration file in the `migrations/` directory. Sequelize automatically adds an `id` field as the primary key for each model, and `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to track the creation and update times of each record. 

We still need to define the relationships between the `Author` and `Book` models. Update the `book.js` file with the following code:

```javascript
// models/book.js

'use strict';
const { Model } = require('sequelize');

module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  class Book extends Model {
    static associate(models) {
      Book.belongsTo(models.Author, {
        foreignKey: 'authorId',
        as: 'author',
        onDelete: 'CASCADE'
      });
    }
  }
  Book.init({
    title: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false },
    authorId: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, allowNull: false },
  }, {
    sequelize,
    modelName: 'Book',
  });
  return Book;
};
```

Sequelize does not automatically regenerate the migration files when you update the models. So, we need to manually update the migration files to add the foreign key constraint. 

Update the migration file corresponding to the `Book` model with the following code:

```javascript
'use strict';
/** @type {import('sequelize-cli').Migration} */
module.exports = {
  async up(queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await queryInterface.createTable('Books', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER
      },
      title: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE
      },
      authorId: {
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
        onDelete: 'CASCADE',
        references: {
          model: 'Authors',
          key: 'id',
        }
      }
    });
  },
  async down(queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('Books');
  }
};
```

Run the following command to apply the migrations and create the tables in the database:

```bash
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

If `Sequlize` successfully connects to the database and runs the migrations, you should see a success message in the terminal. 

### Add sample data to the database

We'll add some sample data to the database using the `Sequelize` ORM. Create a new file named `seed.js` at the project root and add the following code:

```javascript
// seed.js

const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require("sequelize");
const { config } = require("dotenv");

config();
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not set");
}

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true
    }
  }
});

const Author = require('./models/author')(sequelize, DataTypes);
const Book = require('./models/book')(sequelize, DataTypes);

const seedDatabase = async () => {
  const author = await Author.create(
    { name: 'J.K. Rowling', bio: 'The creator of the Harry Potter series' }
  );
  await Book.create({ title: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone', authorId: author.id });
  await Book.create({ title: 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', authorId: author.id });

  const author2 = await Author.create(
    { name: 'J.R.R. Tolkien', bio: 'The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.' }
  );
  await Book.create({ title: 'The Hobbit', authorId: author2.id });
  await Book.create({ title: 'The Fellowship of the Ring', authorId: author2.id });
  await Book.create({ title: 'The Two Towers', authorId: author2.id });
  await Book.create({ title: 'The Return of the King', authorId: author2.id });

  const author3 = await Author.create(
    { name: 'George R.R. Martin', bio: 'The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.' }
  );
  await Book.create({ title: 'A Game of Thrones', authorId: author3.id });
  await Book.create({ title: 'A Clash of Kings', authorId: author3.id });

  await sequelize.close();
};

seedDatabase();
```

Run the following command to seed the database with the sample data:

```bash
node seed.js
```

Sequelize will print logs to the terminal as it connects to the database and adds the sample data.

### Create API endpoints

Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. We'll use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), which is a minimal web application framework for Node.js. 

Create an `index.js` file at the project root, and add the following code to set up your Express server:

```javascript
// index.js

const express = require("express");
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require("sequelize");
const { config } = require("dotenv");

config();
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not set");
}

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: { ssl: { require: true } }
});

// Set up the models
const Author = require('./models/author')(sequelize, DataTypes);
const Book = require('./models/book')(sequelize, DataTypes);

// Create a new Express application
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World! This is a book catalog.");
});

app.get("/authors", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const authors = await Author.findAll();
    res.json(authors);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching authors:", error);
    res.status(500).send("Error fetching authors");
  }
});

app.get("/books/:author_id", async (req, res) => {
  const authorId = parseInt(req.params.author_id);
  try {
    const books = await Book.findAll({
      where: {
        authorId: authorId
      }
    });
    res.json(books);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching books for author:", error);
    res.status(500).send("Error fetching books for author");
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints: `/authors` and `/books/:authorId`. The `/authors` endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the `/books/:authorId` endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author for the given `authorId`. 

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/authors` and `http://localhost:3000/books/1` in your browser to check that the API works as expected. 

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a new Javascript project using `Express.js` and the `Sequelize` ORM, and connected it to a `Neon` Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

# Neon serverless driver

---
title: Neon serverless driver
enableTableOfContents: true
subtitle: Connect to Neon from serverless environments over HTTP or WebSockets
updatedOn: '2024-02-21T23:59:47.049Z'
---

The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over **HTTP** or **WebSockets** in place of TCP. The driver's low-latency capability is due to [message pipelining and other optimizations](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres).

When to query over HTTP vs WebSockets:

- **HTTP**: Querying over an HTTP [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) request is faster for single, non-interactive transactions, also referred to as "one-shot queries". Issuing [multiple queries](#issue-multiple-queries-with-the-transaction-function) via a single, non-interactive transaction is also supported. See [Use the driver over HTTP](#use-the-driver-over-http).
- **WebSockets**: If you require session or interactive transaction support or compatibility with [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) (the popular **npm** `pg` package), use WebSockets. See [Use the driver over WebSockets](#use-the-driver-over-websockets).

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon serverless driver is currently in beta and subject to change in the future.
</Admonition>

## Install the Neon serverless driver

You can install the driver with your preferred JavaScript package manager. For example:

```shell
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

The driver includes TypeScript types (the equivalent of `@types/pg`). No additional installation is required.

## Configure your Neon database connection

You can obtain a connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Your Neon connection string will look something like this:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

The examples that follow assume that your database connection string is assigned to a `DATABASE_URL` variable in your application's environment file.

## Use the driver over HTTP

The Neon serverless driver uses the [neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#neon-function) function for queries over HTTP.

You can use raw SQL queries or tools such as [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/neon), [kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely), [Zapatos](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/), and others for type safety.

<CodeTabs labels={["Node.js", "Drizzle-ORM", "Vercel Edge Function", "Vercel Serverless Function"]}>

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const posts = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
// `post` is now [{ id: 12, title: 'My post', ... }] (or undefined)
```

```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { posts } from './schema';

export default async () => {
  const postId = 12;
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const db = drizzle(sql);
  const [onePost] = await db.select().from(posts).where(eq(posts.id, postId));
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ post: onePost }));
}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export default async (req: Request) => {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const posts = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(post));
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

```ts
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
 
export default async function handler(
  request: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const posts = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
 
  return res.status(500).send(post);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

<Admonition type="note">
The maximum request size and response size for queries over HTTP is 10 MB. Additionally, there is a 15-second proxy timeout for SQL requests over HTTP. Long-running queries that exceed the 15-second threshold are terminated.
</Admonition>

### neon function configuration options

The `neon(...)` function returns a query function that can be used both as a tagged-template function and as an ordinary function:

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

// as a tagged-template function
const rowsA = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;

// as an ordinary function (exactly equivalent)
const rowsB = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
```

By default, the query function returned by `neon(...)` returns only the rows resulting from the provided SQL query, and it returns them as an array of objects where the keys are column names. For example:

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
// -> [{ id: 12, title: "My post", ... }]
```

However, you can customize the return format of the query function using the configuration options `fullResults` and `arrayMode`. These options are available both on the `neon(...)` function and on the query function it returns (but only when the query function is called as an ordinary function, not as a tagged-template function).

- `arrayMode: boolean`, `false` by default

  The default `arrayMode` value is `false`. When it is true, rows are returned as an array of arrays instead of an array of objects:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { arrayMode: true });
  const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
  // -> [[12, "My post", ...]]
  ```

  Or, with the same effect:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const rows = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], { arrayMode: true });
  // -> [[12, "My post", ...]]
  ```

- `fullResults: boolean` 

  The default `fullResults` value is `false`. When it is `true`, additional metadata is returned alongside the result rows, which are then found in the `rows` property of the return value. The metadata matches what would be returned by `node-postgres`:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { fullResults: true });
  const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
  /* -> {
    rows: [{ id: 12, title: "My post", ... }],
    fields: [
      { name: "id", dataTypeID: 23, ... },
      { name: "title", dataTypeID: 25, ... },
      ...
    ],
    rowCount: 1,
    rowAsArray: false,
    command: "SELECT"
  } 
  */
  ```

  Or, with the same effect:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const results = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], { fullResults: true });
  // -> { ... same as above ... }
 
  ```

- `fetchOptions: Record<string, any>`

  The `fetchOptions` option can also be passed to either `neon(...)` or the `query` function. This option takes an object that is merged with the options to the `fetch` call.

  For example, to increase the priority of every database `fetch` request:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { fetchOptions: { priority: 'high' } });
  const rows = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
  ```

  Or to implement a `fetch` timeout:

  ```javascript
  import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  const abortController = new AbortController();
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => abortController.abort('timed out'), 10000);
  const rows = await sql(
    'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId], 
    { fetchOptions: { signal: abortController.signal } }
  );  // throws an error if no result received within 10s
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  ```

For additional details, see [Options and configuration](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#options-and-configuration).

### Issue multiple queries with the transaction() function

The `transaction(queriesOrFn, options)` function is exposed as a property on the query function. It allows multiple queries to be executed within a single, non-interactive transaction.

The first argument to `transaction(), queriesOrFn`, is either an array of queries or a non-async function that receives a query function as its argument and returns an array of queries.

The array-of-queries case looks like this:

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const showLatestN = 10;

const [posts, tags] = await sql.transaction([
  sql`SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT ${showLatestN}`,
  sql`SELECT * FROM tags`,
], { 
  isolationLevel: 'RepeatableRead',
  readOnly: true, 
});
```

Or as an example of the function case:

```javascript
const [authors, tags] = await neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .transaction(txn => [
    txn`SELECT * FROM authors`,
    txn`SELECT * FROM tags`,
  ]);
```

The optional second argument to `transaction()`, `options`, has the same keys as the options to the ordinary query function -- `arrayMode`, `fullResults` and `fetchOptions` â plus three additional keys that concern the transaction configuration. These transaction-related keys are: `isolationMode`, `readOnly` and `deferrable`.

Note that options **cannot** be supplied for individual queries within a transaction. Query and transaction options must instead be passed as the second argument of the `transaction()` function. For example, this `arrayMode` setting is ineffective (and TypeScript won't compile it): `await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()', [], { arrayMode: true })])`. Instead, use `await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()')], { arrayMode: true })`.

- `isolationMode`

  This option selects a Postgres [transaction isolation mode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html). If present, it must be one of `ReadUncommitted`, `ReadCommitted`, `RepeatableRead`, or `Serializable`.

- `readOnly`
  
  If `true`, this option ensures that a `READ ONLY` transaction is used to execute the queries passed. This is a boolean option. The default value is `false`.

- `deferrable`

  If `true` (and if `readOnly` is also `true`, and `isolationMode` is `Serializable`), this option ensures that a `DEFERRABLE` transaction is used to execute the queries passed. This is a boolean option. The default value is `false`.

For additional details, see [transaction(...) function](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#transaction-function).

### Advanced configuration options

For advanced configuration options, see [neonConfig configuration](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#neonconfig-configuration), in the Neon serverless driver GitHub readme.

## Use the driver over WebSockets

The Neon serverless driver supports the [Pool and Client](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless?tab=readme-ov-file#pool-and-client) constructors for querying over WebSockets.

The `Pool` and `Client` constructors, provide session and transaction support, as well as `node-postgres` compatibility. You can find the API guide for the `Pool` and `Client` constructors in the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) documentation.

Consider using the driver with `Pool` or `Client` in the following scenarios:

- You already use `node-postgres` in your code base and would like to migrate to using `@neondatabase/serverless`.
- You are writing a new code base and want to use a package that expects a `node-postgres-compatible` driver.
- Your backend service uses sessions / interactive transactions with multiple queries per connection.

You can use the Neon serverless driver in the same way you would use `node-postgres` with `Pool` and `Client`. Where you usually import `pg`, import `@neondatabase/serverless` instead.

<CodeTabs labels={["Node.js", "Prisma", "Drizzle-ORM", "Vercel Edge Function", "Vercel Serverless Function"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const pool = new Pool({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL});
const posts = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =$1', [postId]);
pool.end();
```

```typescript
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import ws from 'ws';

  ctx.waitUntil(pool.end())
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ post: onePost }));
}

export default async (req: Request, ctx: any) => {
  const pool = new Pool({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL});
  await pool.connect();

  const posts = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  
  ctx.waitUntil(pool.end());

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(post), { 
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
  });
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

```ts
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
 
export default async function handler(
  request: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const pool = new Pool({connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL});
  const posts = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  
  await pool.end();

  return res.status(500).send(post);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Pool and Client usage notes

- In Node.js and some other environments, there's no built-in WebSocket support. In these cases, supply a WebSocket constructor function.

  ```javascript
  import ws from 'ws';
  neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
  ```
- In serverless environments such as Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers, WebSocket connections can't outlive a single request. That means `Pool` or `Client` objects must be connected, used and closed within a single request handler. Don't create them outside a request handler; don't create them in one handler and try to reuse them in another; and to avoid exhausting available connections, don't forget to close them.

For examples that demonstrate these points, see [Pool and Client](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless?tab=readme-ov-file#pool-and-client).

### Advanced configuration options

For advanced configuration options, see [neonConfig configuration](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#neonconfig-configuration), in the Neon serverless driver GitHub readme.

title: Connect from AWS Lambda
subtitle: Learn how to set up a Neon database and connect from an AWS Lambda function
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.279Z'
---

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a convenient and cost-effective solution for running various types of workloads, including those that require a database.

This guide describes how to set up a Neon database and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. It covers:

- Creating a Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), which is a serverless application lifecycle management framework.
- Connecting your Lambda function to a Neon database.
- Deploying the Lambda function to AWS.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up/) for instructions.
- An AWS account. You can create a free AWS account at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). An [IAM User and Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) are required to programmatically interact with your AWS account. You must provide these credentials when deploying the Serverless Framework project.
- A Service Framework account. You can sign up at [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a table in Neon

To create a table, navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/):

In the SQL Editor, run the following queries to create a `users` table and insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES
    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
    ('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com'),
    ('Dave', 'dave@example.com'),
    ('Eve', 'eve@example.com');
```

## Create a Lambda function

Create the Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/):

1. Install the Serverless Framework by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g serverless
    ```

2. Create a `my-lambda` project directory and navigate to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir neon-lambda
    cd neon-lambda
    ```

3. Run the **serverless** command to create a serverless project.

    ```bash
     serverless
    ```

    Follow the prompts, as demonstrated below. You will be required to provide your AWS account credentials. The process creates an `aws-node-project` directory.

    ```bash
    ? What do you want to make? AWS - Node.js - Starter
    ? What do you want to call this project? aws-node-project

    â Project successfully created in aws-node-project folder

    ? Do you want to login/register to Serverless Dashboard? Yes

    ```

4. Navigate to the `aws-node-project` directory created by the previous step and install the `node-postgres` package, which you will use to connect to the database.

    ```bash
    npm install pg
    ```

    After installing the `node-postgres` package, the following dependency should be defined in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
     "dependencies": {
       "pg": "^8.8.0"
     }
    }
    ```

5. In the `aws-node-project` directory, add a `users.js` file, and add the following code to it:

    ```javascript
    'use strict';

    const { Client } = require('pg');

    module.exports.getAllUsers = async () => {
     var client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
     client.connect();
     var { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * from users');
     return {
       statusCode: 200,
       body: JSON.stringify({
         data: rows,
       }),
     };
    };
    ```

    The code in the `users.js` file exports the `getAllUsers` function, which retrieves all rows from the `users` table and returns them as a `JSON` object in the `HTTP` response body.

    This function uses the `pg` library to connect to the Neon database. It creates a new `Client` instance and passes the database connection string, which is defined in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. It then calls `connect()` to establish a connection to the database. Finally, it uses the `query()` method to execute a `SELECT` statement that retrieves all rows from the `users` table.

    The query method returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object containing the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` statement, which the function parses to retrieve the `rows` property. Finally, the function returns an `HTTP` response with a status code of 200 and a body that contains a `JSON` object with a single `data` property, which is set to the value of the rows variable.

6. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and the function definition to the `serverless.yml` file, which is located in your `aws-node-project` directory.

    <Admonition type="note">
    Environment variables can also be added to a `.env` file and loaded automatically with the help of the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. For more information, see [Resolution of environment variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/environment-variables).
    </Admonition>

    You can copy the connection string from **Connection Details** widget the Neon Console. Add the `DATABASE_URL` under `environment`, and add `sslmode=require` to the end of the connection string to enable SSL. The `sslmode=require` option tells Postgres to use SSL encryption and verify the server's certificate.
  
    ```yaml shouldWrap
    provider:
     name: aws
     runtime: nodejs14.x
     environment:
       DATABASE_URL: postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require

    functions:
     getAllUsers:
       handler: users.getAllUsers
       events:
         - httpApi:
             path: /users
             method: get
    ```

7. Deploy the serverless function using the following command:

    ```bash
    serverless deploy
    ```

    The `serverless deploy` command generates an API endpoint using [API Gateway](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api). The output of the command appears similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1, "default" provider)

    â Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (60s)

    dashboard: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/apps/aws-node-project/aws-node-project/dev/us-east-1

    endpoint: GET - https://ge3onb0klj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users

    functions:

      getAllUsers: aws-node-project-dev-getAllUsers (225 kB)
    ```
  
8. Test the generated endpoint by running a cURL command. For example:

    ```bash
    curl https://eg3onb0jkl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users | jq
    ```

    The response returns the following data:

    ```bash
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "email": "alice@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "email": "bob@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "email": "charlie@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Dave",
          "email": "dave@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "name": "Eve",
          "email": "eve@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Enabling CORS

If you make API calls to the Lambda function from your app, you will likely need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  Visit the AWS documentation for information about [how to enable CORS in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-cors.html).

You can run the following command to enable CORS to your local development environment:

```bash shouldWrap
aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id <api-id> --cors-configuration AllowOrigins="http://localhost:3000"
```

You can find your `api-id` on the API Gateway dashboard:

## Conclusion

In this guide, you have learned how to set up a Postgres database using Neon and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. You have also learned how to use Serverless Framework to create and deploy the Lambda function, and how to use the `pg` library to perform a basic database read operations.

subtitle: Set up a global database cache with Neon's PolyScale integration
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-04T18:49:23.387Z'
---

[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) allows you to easily cache your data globally through its low-latency [regional edge network](https://docs.polyscale.ai/edge-network-and-security/#regional-edge-network). Enjoy benefits like speedy accces to your data from anywhere in the world, reduced load on your database, and improved slow query performance. A PolyScale global cache is also an alternative to cross-regional replication without the added complexity. No coding or infrastructure changes are required to use PolyScale. You can have it up and running in just a few minutes.

Adding the PolyScale integration to a Neon project automatically creates a global cache and provides you with a PolyScale connection string, which you can use in your application as a direct replacement for your Neon connection string.

By default, PolyScale automatically caches all queries that pass through its platform. This means that when you connect through PolyScale, any queries you run will be automatically cached. Requests are routed to the closest Point Of Presence (POP) location where your query results are  cached for low latency access.

<Admonition type="note">
The PolyScale integration creates a cache for the read-write compute endpoint associated with the [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch) of your Neon project. It does not cache queries for read-only compute endpoints ([read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas)) or [non-primary branches](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch). If you want to set up a cache for those, please refer to the [manual PolyScale setup instructions](/docs/guides/polyscale).
</Admonition>

For more information about PolyScale, see [How PolyScale works](#how-polyscale-works).

To get started with the Neon PolyScale integration, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account and project. For instructions, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A database on the primary branch of your Neon project. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).

## Add the PolyScale integration

To add the PolyScale integration to your Neon project:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page for your project.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Add** to open the **Add PolyScale** drawer.
    ![Integrations page showing PolyScale](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_add_integration.png)
3. Under **How to add**, click **Sign in**, and sign in to PolyScale using your Google, GitHub, or email account. If you do not have a PolyScale account, you can create one. PolyScale offers a free plan and no credit card is required.
    ![PolyScale sign in](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_sign_in.png)
4. Select the desired PolyScale **Workspace** and click **Authorize Access** to allow Neon to access read and write caches on PolyScale.
    ![PolyScale authorize access](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_authorize.png)

    After the integration is added, you are returned to the **Integrations** page. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** if the **Manage PolyScale** drawer is not already opened. 

    ![PolyScale manage drawer](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_manage.png)

    Here, you can view information about your newly created PolyScale cache and copy the PolyScale connection string. Use this connection string in place of your Neon connection string in your application.

    You might notice the drop-down menus for **Database** and **Role**. If you have multiple databases and roles on the primary branch of your Neon project, use the drop-down menus to select the database and role you want to connect with. Your selections will be reflected in the PolyScale connection string.
   
    <Admonition type="note">
    To ensure your cache remains current, always use the PolyScale connection string. Modifying your database directly through a Neon connection string or the Neon SQL Editor can result in an outdated cache.
    </Admonition>

## View your PolyScale cache

You can access your PolyScale cache directly from the Neon PolyScale integration.

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click the **View cache in PolyScale** link. You directed to PolyScale where you will be required to log in if not logged in already.

## Purging your PolyScale cache

Occasionally, it may be necessary to purge your PolyScale cache. For example, you may want to purge your cache after modifying your data directly without using the PolyScale connection string, which can result in an outdated cache.

To purge your PolyScale cache:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click **Purge PolyScale cache**.

Purging the cache purges all cached data globally.

## Remove the PolyScale integration

To remove the PolyScale integration:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click **Remove integration**.

Removing the integration deletes the cache and terminates all current connections using the PolyScale connection string.

## How PolyScale works

When you use a PolyScale connection string in your application, PolyScale automatically caches the queries that pass through its platform via the connection string. That means any queries you run using the PolyScale connection string are cached, by default.

PolyScale identifies caching opportunities by recognizing and remembering patterns in query traffic. New queries typically begin to see cache hits on or about the third query. For more information on this topic, see [Time To First Hit](https://docs.polyscale.ai/how-does-it-work/#time-to-first-hit-ttfh), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

After queries from your application start passing through PolyScale, you can monitor traffic and caching behavior on the **Observability** tab in PolyScale. For instructions, see [Observability](https://docs.polyscale.ai/database-observability/), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

For additional information about the PolyScale platform, please refer to the [PolyScale documentation](https://docs.polyscale.ai/).

[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) is a serverless database cache service. With PolyScale, you can distribute and cache your data globally, allowing you to scale your database without altering transactional semantics. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. You can connect Neon to PolyScale in minutes, providing your database-backed applications with speedy access to your Neon data from anywhere in the world. 

<Admonition type="note">
Neon also provides a [PolyScale integration](/docs/guides/polyscale-integration), which allows you to set up a PolyScale cache in just a few clicks. The PolyScale integration creates a cache for the read-write compute endpoint associated with your project's [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch). If you do not want to use the integration or you want to set up a cache for a read-only compute endpoint ([read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas)) or a [non-primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch), use these manual setup instructions.
</Admonition>

Follow the steps below to connect your Neon database to PolyScale manually.

## Retrieve your Neon connection details

In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

Copy the hostname. In the example above, the hostname is this part of the connection string:

```text
 ep-raspy-cherry-95040071.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
 ```

Also, make note of the user, password, and database name. You will need those details when you configure a connection from your  application to PolyScale.

## Create a PolyScale cache

A PolyScale account can have one or more caches. A cache identifies a database by the hostname and port number. Typically, you create one cache per database.

To create the database cache:

1. Log into [PolyScale](https://app.polyscale.ai/signup/). If you do not have an account, you can create one by logging in with your GitHub or Google account. PolyScale has a free tier and does not require a credit card to sign up.
2. If you have just signed up for PolyScale, select **Create new cache** from the **Welcome to PolyScale** dialog.
![Connection details widget](/docs/guides/welcome_to_polyscale.png)
If you already have a PolyScale account, click the **New Cache** button in the upper right corner of the PolyScale dashboard.
3. Enter a name for the cache, select `PostgreSQL` as the type, enter the Neon hostname you copied earlier, and enter the database port number. Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`. Leave the default values for the other settings. The **Caching** setting enables the database query cache, so this setting should remain enabled.
![Create a PolyScale cache](/docs/guides/polyscale_create_cache.png)
4. Click **Create**. PolyScale creates a cache for your Neon database and provides a new **Connection URI** to use in your application in place of the Neon connection string. Simply replace `[USERNAME]`, `[PASSWORD]`, and `[DATABASE]` with the values from your Neon connection string.
![Create a PolyScale cache](/docs/guides/polyscale_success.png)

After queries from your application start passing through PolyScale, you can monitor traffic and caching behavior on the **Observability** tab in PolyScale. For more information, see [Observability](https://docs.polyscale.ai/database-observability/), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

By default, PolyScale automatically caches all queries that pass through the platform. That means you can connect to PolyScale, and any queries you run will be cached.

PolyScale identifies caching opportunities by recognizing and remembering patterns in query traffic. New queries typically begin to see cache hits on or about the third query.

title: Use Neon with Cloudflare Hyperdrive
subtitle: Connect Cloudflare Hyperdrive to your Neon Postgres database for faster
  queries
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-21T23:59:47.044Z'
---

[Cloudflare Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) is a serverless application that proxies queries to your database and accelerates them. It works by maintaining a globally distributed pool of database connections, and routing queries to the closest available connection. 

This is specifically useful for serverless applications that cannot maintain a persistent database connection and need to establish a new connection for each request. Hyperdrive can significantly reduce the latency of these queries for your application users.

This guide demonstrates how to configure a Hyperdrive service to connect to your Neon Postgres database. It demonstrates how to implement a regular `Workers` application that connects to Neon directly and then replace that connection with a `Hyperdrive` connection to achieve performance improvements. 

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you require:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.

- A Cloudflare account. If you do not have one, sign up for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to get started. 

    **NOTE**: You need to be on Cloudflare Workers' paid subscription plan to use Hyperdrive.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and deploy our Workers application. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

2. Click the **New Project** button to create a new project.

3. From your project dashboard, navigate to the **SQL Editor** from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books_to_read (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title TEXT,
        author TEXT
    );
    ```

    Next, we insert some sample data into the `books_to_read` table, so we can query it later:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books_to_read (title, author)
    VALUES
        ('The Way of Kings', 'Brandon Sanderson'),
        ('The Name of the Wind', 'Patrick Rothfuss'),
        ('Coders at Work', 'Peter Seibel'),
        ('1984', 'George Orwell');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Setting up your Cloudflare Workers application

### Create a new Worker project

Run the following command in a terminal window to set up a new Cloudflare Workers project:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to generate a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:
```bash
â In which directory do you want to create your application?
â dir ./neon-hyperdrive-guide
â
â What type of application do you want to create?
â type "Hello World" Worker
â
â Do you want to use TypeScript?
â no typescript
```

When asked if you want to deploy your application, select `no`. We'll develop and test the application locally before deploying it to the Cloudflare Workers platform.

The `create-cloudflare` CLI also installs the `Wrangler` tool to manage the full workflow of testing and managing your Worker applications. To emulate the Node environment in the Workers runtime, we need to add the following entry to the `wrangler.toml` file. 

```toml
node_compat=true
```

### Implement the Worker script

We'll use the `node-postgres` library to connect to the Postgres database (directly to Neon first, later we will connect to the Hyperdrive service), so you need to install it as a dependency. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install pg
```

Now, you can update the `src/index.js` file in the project directory with the following code:

```javascript
import pkg from 'pg';

const { Client } = pkg;

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		const client = new Client({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL });
		await client.connect();
		const { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * FROM books_to_read;');
		return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows));
	},
};
```

The `fetch` handler defined above gets called when the worker receives an HTTP request. It will query the Neon database to fetch the full list of books in our to-read list. 

### Test the worker application locally

First, you need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to the Neon database. You can do this by creating a `.dev.vars` file at the root of the project directory with the following content:

```text
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, to test the worker application locally, you can use the `wrangler` CLI which comes with the Cloudflare project setup.

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

This command starts a local server and simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment. You can visit the printed URL in your browser to test the worker application. It should return a JSON response with the list of books from the `books_to_read` table. 

## Setting up Cloudflare Hyperdrive

With our Workers application able to query the Neon database, we will now set up Cloudflare Hyperdrive to connect to Neon and accelerate the database queries. 

### Create a new Hyperdrive service

You can use the `Wrangler` CLI to create a new Hyperdrive service, using your Neon database connection string from earlier:

```bash
npx wrangler hyperdrive create neon-guide-drive --connection-string=$NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

This command creates a new Hyperdrive service named `neon-guide-drive` and outputs its configuration details. Copy the `id` field from the output, which we will use next. 

### Bind the Worker project to Hyperdrive

Cloudflare workers uses `Bindings` to interact with other resources on the Cloudflare platform. We will update the `wrangler.toml` file in the project directory to bind our Worker project to the Hyperdrive service. 

Add the following lines to the `wrangler.toml` file. This lets us access the Hyperdrive service from our Worker application using the `HYPERDRIVE` binding. 

```toml
[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = $id-from-previous-step
```

### Update the Worker script to use Hyperdrive

Now, you can update the `src/index.js` file in the project directory to query the Neon database, through the Hyperdrive service. 

```javascript
import pkg from 'pg';

const { Client } = pkg;

export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
        // We replace the direct database connection with the Hyperdrive service
        const client = new Client({ connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString });
        await client.connect();
        const { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * FROM books_to_read;');
        return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows));
  }
}
```

### Deploy the updated Worker 

Now that we have updated the Worker script to use the Hyperdrive service, we can deploy the updated Worker to the Cloudflare Workers platform:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

This command uploads the updated Worker script to the Cloudflare Workers platform and makes it available at a public URL. You can visit the URL in your browser to test that the application works. 

## Removing the example application and Neon project

To delete your Worker project, you can use the Cloudflare dashboard or run `wrangler delete` from your project directory, specifying your project name. Refer to the [Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#delete-3) for more details.

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

title: Use Neon with Cloudflare Pages
subtitle: Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Cloudflare Pages web application
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-21T23:59:47.047Z'
---

`Cloudflare Pages` is a modern web application hosting platform that allows you to build, deploy, and scale your web applications. While it is typically used to host static websites, you can also use it to host interactive web applications by leveraging `functions` to run server-side code. Internally, Cloudflare functions are powered by `Cloudflare Workers`, a serverless platform that allows you to run JavaScript code on Cloudflare's edge network.

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from your Cloudflare Pages application. We'll create a simple web application using `React` that tracks our reading list using the database and provides a form to add new books to it.

We'll use the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the database and make queries.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A Cloudflare account. If you do not have one, sign up for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to get started.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and deploy our `Pages` application.

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

2. Click the **New Project** button to create a new project.

3. From your project dashboard, navigate to the **SQL Editor** from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books_to_read (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title TEXT,
        author TEXT
    );
    ```

    Next, we insert some sample data into the `books_to_read` table, so we can query it later:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books_to_read (title, author)
    VALUES
        ('The Way of Kings', 'Brandon Sanderson'),
        ('The Name of the Wind', 'Patrick Rothfuss'),
        ('Coders at Work', 'Peter Seibel'),
        ('1984', 'George Orwell');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Setting up your Cloudflare Pages project

### Create a new project

We will create a simple React application using the Vite bundler framework. Run the following command in a terminal window to set up a new Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to generate a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:

```bash
â Project name: â¦ my-neon-page
â Select a framework: âº React
â Select a variant: âº JavaScript

Scaffolding project in /Users/ishananand/repos/javascript/my-neon-page...

Done. Now run:

  cd my-neon-page
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

We set up a template React configured to be built using Vite.

### Implement the application frontend

Navigate to the `my-neon-page` directory and open the `src/App.jsx` file. Replace the contents of this file with the following code:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);
  const [bookName, setBookName] = useState("");
  const [authorName, setAuthorName] = useState("");

  // Function to fetch books
  const fetchBooks = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch("/books");
      const data = await response.json();
      setBooks(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching books:", error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBooks();
  }, []);

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    try {
      const response = await fetch("/books/add", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ title: bookName, author: authorName }),
      });
      const data = await response.json();

      if (data.success) {
        console.log("Success:", data);
        setBooks([...books, { title: bookName, author: authorName }]);
      } else {
        console.error("Error adding book:", data.error);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }

    // Reset form fields
    setBookName("");
    setAuthorName("");
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Book List</h1>
      <ul>
        {books.map((book, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {book.title} by {book.author}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h2>Add a Book</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Book Name:
          <input
            type="text"
            value={bookName}
            onChange={(e) => setBookName(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        <label>
          Author Name:
          <input
            type="text"
            value={authorName}
            onChange={(e) => setAuthorName(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Add Book</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `App` component fetches the list of books from the server and displays them. It also provides a form to add new books to the list. `Cloudflare` Pages allows us to define the API endpoints as serverless functions, which we'll implement next.

### Implement the serverless functions

We'll use the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the Neon database, so we first need to install it as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

Next, we'll create two serverless functions for the application. In a `Cloudflare Pages` project, these must be defined in the `functions` directory at the root of the project. For further details, refer to the [Cloudflare Pages - Functions documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/).

#### Function to fetch list of books from the database

Create a new file named `functions/books/index.js` in the project directory with the following content:

```js
import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export async function onRequestGet(context) {
  const client = new Client(context.env.DATABASE_URL);
  await client.connect();

  // Logic to fetch books from your database
  const { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * FROM books_to_read;');
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows));
}
```

This function fetches the list of books from the `books_to_read` table in the database and returns it as a JSON response.

#### Function to add a new book to the database

Create another file named `functions/books/add.js` in the project directory with the following content:

```js
import { Client } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

export async function onRequestPost(context) {
  const client = new Client(context.env.DATABASE_URL);
  await client.connect();

  // Extract the book details from the request body
  const book = await context.request.json();

  // Logic to insert a new book into your database
  const resp = await client.query(
    "INSERT INTO books_to_read (title, author) VALUES ($1, $2); ",
    [data.title, data.author],
  );

  // Check if insert query was successful
  if (resp.rowCount === 1) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ success: true, error: null, data: book }),
      {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      },
    );
  } else {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        success: false,
        error: "Failed to insert book",
        data: book,
      }),
      {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        status: 500,
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This function extracts the book details from the request body and inserts it into the `books_to_read` table in the database. It returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Test the application locally

Our application is now ready to be tested locally. However, we first need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to our Neon database.

We can do this by creating a `.dev.vars` file at the root of the project directory with the following content:

```text
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, to test the `Pages` application locally, we can use the `wrangler` CLI tool used to manage Cloudflare projects. We can use it using the `npx` command as:

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev -- npm run dev
```

This command starts a local server simulating the Cloudflare environment. The function endpoints are run by the Wrangler tool while requests to the root URL are proxied to the Vite development server.

```bash
â¯ npx wrangler pages dev -- npm run dev
Running npm run dev...
.
.
.
.
-------------------
Using vars defined in .dev.vars
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Vars:
  - DATABASE_URL: "(hidden)"
â Starting local server...
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8788
```

Visit the printed localhost URL in your browser to interact with the application. You should see the list of books fetched from the database and a form to add new books.

## Deploying your application with Cloudflare Pages

### Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account

Run the following command to link the Wrangler tool to your Cloudflare account:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

This command will open a browser window and prompt you to log into your Cloudflare account. After logging in and approving the access request for `Wrangler`, you can close the browser window and return to your terminal.

### Publish your Pages application and verify the deployment

Now, you can deploy your application to `Cloudflare Pages` by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT>
```

Give a unique name to your `Cloudflare Pages` project above. The Wrangler CLI will output the URL of your application hosted on the Cloudflare platform. Visit this URL in your browser to interact with it.

```bash
â¨ Compiled Worker successfully
ð  Uploading... (4/4)

â¨ Success! Uploaded 0 files (4 already uploaded) (0.72 sec)

â¨ Uploading Functions bundle
â¨ Deployment complete! Take a peek over at https://21ea2a57.my-neon-page.pages.dev
```

### Add your Neon connection string as an environment variable

The Cloudflare production deployment doesn't have access to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable yet. Hence, we need to navigate to the Cloudflare dashboard and add it manually. 

Navigate to the dashboard and select the `Settings` section in your project. Go to the **Environment Variables** tab and add a new environment variable named `DATABASE_URL` with the value of your Neon database connection string.

To make sure the environment variable is available to the serverless functions, go back to the terminal and redeploy the project using the `wrangler` CLI:

```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT>
```

Now, visit the URL of your `Cloudflare Pages` application to interact with it. You should see the list of books fetched from the Neon database and a form to add new books.

## Removing the example application and Neon project

To delete your `Cloudflare Pages` application, you can use the Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to the [Pages documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages) for more details.

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

# Cloudflare Workers

---
title: Use Neon with Cloudflare Workers
subtitle: Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Cloudflare Workers application
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-21T23:59:47.048Z'
---

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) is a serverless platform allowing you to deploy your applications globally across Cloudflare's network. It supports running JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly, making it a great choice for high-performance, low-latency web applications.

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from your Cloudflare Workers application. We'll use the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the database and make queries.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A Cloudflare account. If you do not have one, sign up for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) to get started.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and deploy the Workers application.

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

1. Click the **New Project** button to create a new project.

2. From the Neon **Dashboard**, navigate to the **SQL Editor** from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books_to_read (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title TEXT,
        author TEXT
    );
    ```

    Next, insert some sample data into the `books_to_read` table so that you can query it later:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books_to_read (title, author)
    VALUES
        ('The Way of Kings', 'Brandon Sanderson'),
        ('The Name of the Wind', 'Patrick Rothfuss'),
        ('Coders at Work', 'Peter Seibel'),
        ('1984', 'George Orwell');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. Select the **Pooled connection** option to add the `-pooler` option to your connection string. A pooled connection is recommended for serverless environments. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

Your pooled connection string should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Setting up your Cloudflare Workers project

### Create a new Worker project

Run the following command in a terminal window to set up a new Cloudflare Workers project:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to generate a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:
```bash
â In which directory do you want to create your application?
â dir ./my-neon-worker
â
â What type of application do you want to create?
â type "Hello World" Worker
â
â Do you want to use TypeScript?
â no typescript
```

When asked if you want to deploy your application, select `no`. We'll develop and test the application locally before deploying it to Cloudflare Workers platform.

The `create-cloudflare` CLI installs the `Wrangler` tool to manage the full workflow of testing and managing your Worker applications.

### Implement the Worker script

We'll use the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the Neon database, so you need to install it as a dependency:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

Now, you can update the `src/index.js` file in the project directory with the following code:

```js
import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const client = new Client(env.DATABASE_URL);
    await client.connect();
    const { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * FROM books_to_read;');
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows));
  }
}
```

The `fetch` handler defined above gets called when the worker receives an HTTP request. It will query the Neon database to fetch the full list of books in our to-read list.

### Test the worker application locally

You first need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to our Neon database. You can do this by creating a `.dev.vars` file at the root of the project directory with the following content:

```text
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, to test the worker application locally, you can use the `wrangler` CLI which comes with the Cloudflare project setup.

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

This command starts a local server and simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment.

```bash
â¯ npx wrangler dev
 âï¸ wrangler 3.28.1
-------------------
Using vars defined in .dev.vars
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Vars:
  - DATABASE_URL: "(hidden)"
â Starting local server...
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

You can visit `http://localhost:8787` in your browser to test the worker application. It should return a JSON response with the list of books from the `books_to_read` table.

```
[{"id":1,"title":"The Way of Kings","author":"Brandon Sanderson"},{"id":2,"title":"The Name of the Wind","author":"Patrick Rothfuss"},{"id":3,"title":"Coders at Work","author":"Peter Seibel"},{"id":4,"title":"1984","author":"George Orwell"}]
```

## Deploying your application with Cloudflare Workers

### Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account

Run the following command to link the Wrangler tool to your Cloudflare account:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

This command will open a browser window and prompt you to log into your Cloudflare account. After logging in and approving the access request for `Wrangler`, you can close the browser window and return to your terminal.

### Add your Neon connection string as a secret

Use Wrangler to add your Neon database connection string as a secret to your Worker:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

When prompted, paste your Neon connection string.

### Publish your Worker application and verify the deployment

Now, you can deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers by running the following command:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

The Wrangler CLI will output the URL of your Worker hosted on the Cloudflare platform. Visit this URL in your browser or use `curl` to verify the deployment works as expected.

```text
â¯ npx wrangler deploy
 âï¸ wrangler 3.28.1
-------------------
Total Upload: 189.98 KiB / gzip: 49.94 KiB
Uploaded my-neon-worker (4.03 sec)

  https://my-neon-worker.anandishan2.workers.dev
Current Deployment ID: de8841dd-46e4-436d-b2c4-569e91f54c72
```

## Removing the example application and Neon project

To delete your Worker, you can use the Cloudflare dashboard or run `wrangler delete` from your project directory, specifying your project name. Refer to the [Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#delete-3) for more details.

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

title: Use Neon with Deno Deploy
subtitle: Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Deno Deploy application
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.282Z'
---

[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a scalable serverless platform for running JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, designed by the creators of Deno. It simplifies the deployment process and offers automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and global distribution.

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from a simple Deno application that uses [deno-postgres](https://deno.land/x/postgres@ls) driver to interact with the database.

The guide covers two deployment options:

- [Deploying your application locally with Deno Runtime](#deploy-your-application-locally-with-deno-runtime)
- [Deploying your application with the Deno Deploy serverless platform](#deploy-your-application-with-deno-deploy)

## Prerequisites

To follow the instructions in this guide, you will need:

- A Neon project. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- To use the Deno Deploy serverless platform, you require a Deno Deploy account. Visit [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) to sign up or log in.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Retrieve your database connection string from the **Connection Details** widget in the Neon Console.

Your connection string should look something like this:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

You'll need the connection string a little later in the setup.

## Deploy your application locally with Deno Runtime

Deno Runtime is an open-source runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript. The following instructions describe how to deploy an example application locally using Deno Runtime.

### Install the Deno Runtime and deployctl

Follow the [Install Deno and deployctl](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/#install-deno-and-deployctl) instructions in the Deno documentation to install the Deno runtime and `deployctl` command-line utility on your local machine.

### Create the example application

Next, create the `server.ts` script on your local machine.

```ts
// server.ts

import * as postgres from "https://deno.land/x/postgres@v0.17.0/mod.ts";

const databaseUrl = Deno.env.get("DATABASE_URL")!;

const pool = new postgres.Pool(databaseUrl, 3, true);

const connection = await pool.connect();
try {
  await connection.queryObject`
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      author TEXT NOT NULL
    );
  `;

  // Check if the table is empty by getting the count of rows
  const result = await connection.queryObject<{ count: number }>`
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM books;
  `;
  const bookCount = Number(result.rows[0].count);

  if (bookCount === 0) {
    // The table is empty, insert the book records
    await connection.queryObject`
      INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES
        ('The Hobbit', 'J. R. R. Tolkien'),
        ('Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone', 'J. K. Rowling'),
        ('The Little Prince', 'Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry');
    `;
  }
} finally {
  connection.release();
}

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  if (url.pathname !== "/books") {
    return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }

  const connection = await pool.connect();
  try {
    switch (req.method) {
      case "GET": {
        const result = await connection.queryObject`SELECT * FROM books`;
        const body = JSON.stringify(result.rows, null, 2);
        return new Response(body, {
          headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
        });
      }
      default:
        return new Response("Method Not Allowed", { status: 405 });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response(`Internal Server Error\n\n${err.message} `, {
      status: 500,
    });
  } finally {
    connection.release();
  }
});
```

The script creates a table named `books` in the `neondb` database if it does not exist and inserts some data into it. It then starts a server that listens for requests on the `/books` endpoint. When a request is received, the script returns data from the `books` table.

### Run the script locally

To run the script locally, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the Neon connection string you copied earlier.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Then, run the command below to start the app server. The `--allow-env` flag allows the script to access the environment variables, and the `--allow-net` flag allows the script to make network requests. If the Deno runtime prompts you to allow these permissions, enter `y` to continue.

```bash
deno run --allow-env --allow-net server.ts
```

### Query the endpoint

You can request the `/books` endpoint with a `cURL` command to view the data returned by the script:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/books
```

The `cURL` command should return the following data:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Hobbit",
    "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
    "author": "J. K. Rowling"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "The Little Prince",
    "author": "Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry"
  }
]%                                     
```

## Deploy your application with Deno Deploy

Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript applications. Your code runs on managed servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster response times. Deno Deploy applications run on light-weight V8 isolates powered by the Deno runtime.

### Set up the project

1. If you have not done so already, install the `deployctl` command-line utility, as described [above](#install-the-deno-runtime-and-deployctl).
1. If you have not done so already, create the example `server.ts` application on your local machine, as described [above](#create-the-example-application).
1. Register or log in to [Deno](https://deno.com/) and navigate to the [Create a project](https://dash.deno.com/new) page, where you can select a project template for your preferred framework, link a code repo, or create an empty project.
1. The example application in this guide is a simple Deno script you've created locally, so let's select the **Create an empty project** option. Note the name of your Deno Deploy project. You will need it in a later step. Projects are given a generated Heroku-style name, which looks something like this: `cloudy-otter-57`.
1. Click the `Settings` button and add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Set the value to your Neon connection string and click **Save**.
1. To authenticate `deployctl` from the terminal, you will need an access token for your Deno Deploy account. Navigate back to your [Deno dashboard](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens) and create a new access token. Copy the token value and set the `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` environment variable on your local machine by running this command from your terminal:

    ```bash
    export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

### Deploy using deployctl

To deploy the application, navigate to the directory of your `server.ts` application, and run the following command:

```bash
deployctl deploy --project=YOUR_DENO_DEPLOY_PROJECT_NAME --prod server.ts
```

The `--prod` flag specifies that the application should be deployed to the production environment.

The `deployctl` command deploys the application to the Deno Deploy serverless platform. Once the deployment is complete, you'll see a message similar to the following:

```bash
$ deployctl deploy --project=cloudy-otter-57 --prod server.ts
â Deploying to project cloudy-otter-57.
  â¹ The project does not have a deployment yet. Automatically pushing initial deployment to production (use --prod for further updates).
â Entrypoint: /home/ubuntu/neon-deno/server.ts
â¹ Uploading all files from the current dir (/home/ubuntu/neon-deno)
â Found 1 asset.
â Uploaded 1 new asset.
â Production deployment complete.
â Created config file 'deno.json'.

View at:
 - https://cloudy-otter-57-8csne31fymac.deno.dev
 - https://cloudy-otter-57.deno.dev
```

### Verifying the deployment

You can now access the application at the URL specified in the output. You can verify its connection to your Neon database by visiting the `/books` endpoint in your browser or using `cURL` to see if the data is returned as expected.

```bash
$ curl https://cloudy-otter-57.deno.dev/books
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Hobbit",
    "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
    "author": "J. K. Rowling"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "The Little Prince",
    "author": "Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry"
  }
]
```

To check the health of the deployment or modify settings, navigate to the [Project Overview](https://dash.deno.com/account/projects) page and select your project from the **Projects** list.

### Deploying using Github

When deploying a more complex Deno application, with custom build steps, you can use Deno's Github integration. The integration lets you link a Deno Deploy project to a GitHub repository. For more information, see [Deploying with GitHub](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/how-to-deploy).

## Removing the example application and Neon project

To delete the example application on Deno Deploy, follow these steps:

1. From the Deno Deploy [dashboard](https://dash.deno.com/account/projects), select your **Project**.
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
1. In the **Danger Zone** section, click **Delete** and follow the instructions.

To delete your Neon project, refer to [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

title: Deploy Your Node.js App with Neon Postgres on Heroku
subtitle: A step-by-step guide to deploying a Node application with a Neon Postgres
  database on Heroku
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-22T00:06:09.652Z'
---

[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a popular platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It simplifies the deployment process, making it a favorite among developers for its ease of use and integration capabilities.

This guide walks you through deploying a simple Node.js application connected to a Neon Postgres database, on Heroku.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A Heroku account. Sign up at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) to get started. 
- Git installed on your local machine. Heroku uses Git for version control and deployment. 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally. 

## Setting Up Your Neon Database

### Initialize a New Project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/projects) section.

2. Click **New Project** to create a new project.

3. In your project dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the following SQL command to create a new table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE music_albums (
        album_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        artist VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO music_albums (title, artist)
    VALUES
        ('Rumours', 'Fleetwood Mac'),
        ('Abbey Road', 'The Beatles'),
        ('Dark Side of the Moon', 'Pink Floyd'),
        ('Thriller', 'Michael Jackson');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Implementing the Node.js Application

We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieves the list of music albums. Run the following commands in your terminal to set it up:

```bash
mkdir neon-heroku-example && cd neon-heroku-example
npm init -y && npm pkg set type="module" && npm pkg set scripts.start="node index.js"
npm install express pg
touch .env
```

We use the `npm pkg set type="module"` command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We'll also create a new `.env` file to store the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the `pg` library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database. 

In the `.env` file, store your Neon database connection string:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import pkg from "pg";

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app.use(express.json());

// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const { Pool } = pkg;
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetch the list of music albums from your database using the postgres connection
    const { rows } = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM music_albums;");
    res.json(rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch albums", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the `URL`, the server queries the `music_albums` table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON. 

We can test this application locally by running:

```bash
node --env-file=.env index.js
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to check it returns the sample data from the `music_albums` table. 

## Deploying to Heroku

### Create a New Heroku App

We will use the `Heroku CLI` to deploy our application to Heroku manually. You can install it on your machine by following the instructions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). Once installed, log in to your Heroku account using:

```bash
â¯ heroku login
 âº   Warning: Our terms of service have changed:
 âº   https://dashboard.heroku.com/terms-of-service
heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/...
```

You will be prompted to log in to your Heroku account in the browser. After logging in, you can close the browser and return to your terminal. 

Before creating the Heroku application, we need to initialize a new Git repository in our project folder:

```bash
git init && echo "node_modules" > .gitignore && echo ".env" >> .gitignore
git branch -M main
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Next, we can create a new app on Heroku using the following command. This creates a new Heroku app with the name `neon-heroku-example`, and sets up a new Git remote for the app called `heroku`.

```bash
heroku create neon-heroku-example
```

You'll also need to set the `DATABASE_URL` on Heroku to your Neon database connection string:

```bash
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL='NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING' -a neon-heroku-example
```

### Deploy Your Application

To deploy your application to Heroku, use the following command to push your code to the `heroku` remote. Heroku will automatically detect that your application is a Node.js application, install the necessary dependencies and deploy it.

```bash
> git push heroku main
.
.
.
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v4
remote:        https://neon-heroku-example-fda03f6acbbe.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
remote: 2024/02/21 07:26:49 Rollbar error: empty token
To https://git.heroku.com/neon-heroku-example.git
remote: Verifying deploy... done. 
```

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a message with the URL of your deployed application. Navigate to this URL in your browser to see your application live on Heroku. 

You've now successfully deployed a Node.js application on Heroku that connects to a Neon Postgres database. For further customization and scaling options, you can explore the Heroku and Neon documentation. 

## Removing Your Application and Neon Project

To remove your application from Heroku, select the app from your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Navigate to the `Settings` tab and scroll down to the end to find the "Delete App" option. 

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

title: Use Neon with Koyeb
subtitle: Learn how to connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with
  Koyeb
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-01T14:26:32.333Z'
---

[Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) is a developer-friendly, serverless platform designed to easily deploy reliable and scalable applications globally. Koyeb offers native autoscaling, automatic HTTPS (SSL), auto-healing, and global load-balancing across their edge network with zero configuration.

This guide describes how connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with Koyeb. To follow the instructions in this guide, you require:

- A [Koyeb account](https://app.koyeb.com/) to deploy the application. Alternatively, you can install the [Koyeb CLI](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/quickstart/koyeb-cli) if you prefer to deploy the application from your terminal.
- A Neon account to deploy the Postgres database. If you do not have one, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).

The example application connects to your Neon Postgres database using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM. Prisma synchronizes the database schema with the Prisma schema included with the application and seeds the database.

## Create a Neon project

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).
1. Select **Create a project**.
1. Enter a name for the project (`neon-koyeb`, for example), and select a Postgres version and region.
1. Click **Create project**.

A dialog pops up with your Neon connection string, which appears similar to the following:

```bash
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

Store this value in a safe place. It is required later. The connection string specifies `neondb` as the database. This is the ready-to-use database created with each Neon project. You will use this database with the example application.

## Deploy the application on Koyeb

You can deploy on Koyeb using the control panel or the Koyeb CLI.

### From the Koyeb control panel

To deploy the application from the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Apps` tab and select **Create App**.
1. Select GitHub as the deployment method.
1. When asked to select the repository to deploy, enter `https://github.com/koyeb/example-express-prisma` in the **Public GitHub repository** field.
1. Keep `example-express-prisma` as the name and `main` as the branch.
1. In **Build and deployment settings**, enable the **Override** setting and add the following **Build command**: `npm run postgres:init`
1. Select the region closest to your Neon database.
1. Under **Advanced** > **Environment variables**, add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to enable the application to connect to your Neon Postgres database. Set the value to the Neon connection string provided to you when you created the Neon project.
1. Enter a name for your app. For example, `express-neon`
1. Click **Deploy**.

Koyeb builds the application. After the build and deployment have finished, you can access your application running on Koyeb by clicking the URL ending with `.koyeb.app`.

The example application exposes a `/planets` endpoint that you can use to list planets from the database. After your deployment is live, you should see the following results when navigating to `https://<YOUR_APP_URL>.koyeb.app/planets`:

```json
[
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mercury"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Venus"
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mars"
}
]
```

### From the Koyeb CLI

You can also deploy your application using the Koyeb CLI. To install it, follow the instructions in the [Koyeb CLI documentation](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/quickstart/koyeb-cli). 

Using the CLI requires an API access token, which you can generate in the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), under **Organization Settings** > **API**. Once generated, run the command `koyeb login` and enter the token when prompted.

To deploy the example application, run the following command in your terminal. Make sure to replace the `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string.

```bash
koyeb apps init express-neon \
--instance-type free \
--git github.com/koyeb/example-express-prisma \
--git-branch main \
--git-build-command "npm run postgres:init" \
--ports 8080:http \
--routes /:8080 \
--env PORT=8080 \
--env DATABASE_URL="{}"
``` 

#### Access Koyeb deployment logs

To track the app deployment and visualize build logs, execute the following command:

```bash
koyeb service logs express-neon/express-neon -t build
```

#### Access your app

After the build and deployment have finished, you can retrieve the public domain to access your application by running the following command:

```bash
$ koyeb app get express-neon
ID          NAME         STATUS         DOMAINS                                CREATED AT          
b8611a1d    express-neon HEALTHY        ["express-neon-myorg.koyeb.app"]       16 Feb 23 18:13 UTC
```

The example application exposes a `/planets` endpoint that you can use to list planets from the database. After your deployment is live, you should see the following results when navigating to `https://<YOUR_APP_URL>.koyeb.app/planets`:

```json
[
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mercury"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Venus"
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mars"
}
]
```

## Delete the example application and Neon project

To delete the example application on Koyeb to avoid incurring any charges, follow these steps:

1. From the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), select the **App** to delete.
1. On the **Settings** tab, select **Danger Zone** and click **Delete**.

To delete your Neon project, refer to [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).


# Netlify Functions

title: Use Neon with Netlify Functions
subtitle: Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Netlify Functions application
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-20T16:06:07.067Z'
---

[Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) provide a serverless execution environment for building and deploying backend functionality without managing server infrastructure. It's integrated with Netlify's ecosystem, making it ideal for augmenting web applications with server-side logic, API integrations, and data processing tasks in a scalable way.

This guide will show you how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from your Netlify Functions project. We'll use the [Neon serverless driver](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to connect to the database and make queries. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A Netlify account for deploying your site with `Functions`. Sign up at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) if necessary. While Netlify can deploy directly from a Github repository, we'll use the `Netlify` CLI tool to deploy our project manually. 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed locally for developing and deploying your Functions. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

After logging into the Neon console, proceed to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

1. Click `New Project` to start a new one.

2. In the Neon **Dashboard**, use the `SQL Editor` from the sidebar to execute the SQL command below, creating a new table for coffee blends:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE favorite_coffee_blends (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        notes TEXT
    );
    ```

    Populate the table with some initial data:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO favorite_coffee_blends (name, origin, notes)
    VALUES
        ('Morning Joy', 'Citrus, Honey, Floral'),
        ('Dark Roast Delight', 'Rich, Chocolate, Nutty'),
        ('Arabica Aroma', 'Smooth, Caramel, Fruity'),
        ('Robusta Revolution', 'Strong, Bold, Bitter');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Setting up your Netlify Functions project

We'll use the Netlify CLI to create a new project and add functions to it. To install the CLI, run:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

To authenticate the CLI with your Netlify account, run:

```bash
netlify login
```

This command opens a browser window to authenticate your terminal session with Netlify. After logging in, you can close the browser window and interact with your Netlify account from the terminal.

### Create a new Netlify project

We will create a simple HTML webpage that fetches the coffee blends from the Neon database using a Netlify Function and displays them. To create a new `Netlify Site` project, run:

```bash
mkdir neon-netlify-example && cd neon-netlify-example
netlify sites:create
```

You will be prompted to select a team and site name. Choose a unique name for your site. This command then links the current directory to a `Site` project in your Netlify account. 

```
â¯ netlify sites:create
? Team: Ishan Anandâs team
? Site name (leave blank for a random name; you can change it later): neon-netlify-example

Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/neon-netlify-example
URL:       https://neon-netlify-example.netlify.app
Site ID:   ed43ba05-ff6e-40a9-9a68-8f58b9ad9937

Linked to neon-netlify-example
```

### Implement the function

We'll create a new function to fetch the coffee blends from the Neon database. To set up the function entrypoint script, you can run the command below and use the settings provided:

```bash
â¯ netlify functions:create get_coffee_blends

? Select the type of function you'd like to create Serverless function (Node/Go/Rust)
? Select the language of your function JavaScript
? Pick a template javascript-hello-world
â Creating function get_coffee_blends
â Created ./netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.js

Function created!
```

This command creates a new directory `netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends` with a `get_coffee_blends.js` file inside it. We are using the ES6 `import` syntax to implement the request handler, so we will change the script extension to `.mjs` for the runtime to recognize it.

We also install the `Neon serverless` driver as a dependency to connect to the Neon database and fetch the data. 

```bash
mv netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.js netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.mjs
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

Now, replace the contents of the function script with the following code:

```javascript
// netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.mjs
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

export async function handler(event) {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
  try {
    const rows = await sql("SELECT * FROM favorite_coffee_blends;");
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(rows),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }),
    };
  }
}
```

This function connects to your Neon database and fetches the list of your favorite coffee blends. 

### Implement the frontend

To make use of the `Function` implemented above, we will create a simple HTML page that fetches and displays the coffee information by calling the function. 

Create a new file `index.html` at the root of your project with the following content:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Coffee Blends</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My favourite coffee blends</h1>
        <ul id="blends"></ul>
        <script>
            (async () => {
                try {
                    const response = await fetch(
                        "/.netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends",
                    );
                    const blends = await response.json();
                    const blendsList = document.getElementById("blends");
                    blends.forEach((blend) => {
                        const li = document.createElement("li");
                        li.innerText = `${blend.name} - ${blend.notes}`;
                        blendsList.appendChild(li);
                    });
                } catch (error) {
                    console.error("Error:", error);
                }
            })();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Test the site locally

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```text
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
```

We are now ready to test our Netlify site project locally. Run the following command to start a local development server:

```bash
netlify dev
```

The Netlify CLI will print the local server URL where your site is running. Open the URL in your browser to see the coffee blends fetched from your Neon database.

### Deploying your Netlify Site and Function

Deploying is straightforward with the Netlify CLI. However, we need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the Netlify deployed site too. You can use the CLI to set it. 

```bash
netlify env:set DATABASE_URL "YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

Now, to deploy your site and function, run the following command. When asked to provide a publish directory, enter `.` to deploy the entire project. 

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

The CLI will build and deploy your site and functions to Netlify. After deployment, Netlify provides a URL for your live function. Navigate to the URL in your browser to check that the deployment was successful.

## Removing the example application and Neon project

For cleanup, delete your Netlify site and functions via the Netlify dashboard or CLI. Consult the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/) for detailed instructions.

To remove your Neon project, follow the deletion steps in Neon's documentation under [Manage Projects](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

1. Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

2. Click the `New Project` button to create a new project.

3. From your project dashboard, navigate to the `SQL Editor` from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE plant_care_log (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        plant_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        care_date DATE NOT NULL
    );
    ```

    Next, we insert some sample data into the `plant_care_log` table, so we can query it later:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO plant_care_log (plant_name, care_date)
    VALUES
        ('Monstera', '2024-01-10'),
        ('Fiddle Leaf Fig', '2024-01-15'),
        ('Snake Plant', '2024-01-20'),
        ('Spider Plant', '2024-01-25'),
        ('Pothos', '2024-01-30');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Implementing the Node.js application

We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieves the list of plants tended to within the last month. Run the following commands in a terminal to set it up. 

```bash
mkdir neon-railway-example && cd neon-railway-example
npm init -y && npm pkg set type="module"
npm install express pg
touch .env
```

We use the `npm pkg set type="module"` command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We also create a new `.env` file to store the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the `pg` library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database. 

```bash
# .env 
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import pkg from "pg";

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app.use(express.json());

// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const { Pool } = pkg;
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetch the list of plants from your database using the postgres connection
    const { rows } = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM plant_care_log;");
    res.json(rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch plants", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the `URL`, the server queries the `plant_care_log` table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON. 

We can test this application locally by running:

```bash
node --env-file=.env index.js
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to check it returns the sample data from the `plant_care_log` table.

## Push Your application to GitHub

To deploy your application to Railway, you need to push your code to a GitHub repository. Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to [GitHub - New Repo](https://github.com/new). You can then push your code to the new repository using the following commands:

```bash
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore && echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "# neon-railway-example" >> README.md
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

You can visit the GitHub repository to verify that your code has been pushed successfully.

## Deploying to Railway

### Creating a new Railway project

Log in to your Railway account and navigate to the dashboard. Click on the `New Project` button and select the `Deploy from Github repo` option. Pick the repository you created above, which sets off a Railway deployment. 

Railway automatically figures out the type of application you're deploying and sets up the necessary build and start commands. However, we still need to add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to our Neon database. 

Select the project and navigate to the `Variables` tab. Add a new variable named `DATABASE_URL` and set its value to your Neon database connection string. You can redeploy the project by clicking on `Redeploy` from the context menu of the latest deployment. 

### Verify Deployment

Once the deployment completes and is marked as `ACTIVE`, Railway provides a public URL for accessing the web service. Visit the provided URL to verify that your application is running and can connect to your Neon database. 

Whenever you update your code and push it to your GitHub repository, Railway will automatically build and deploy the changes to your web service.

## Removing Your Application and Neon Project

To remove your application from Railway, select the project and navigate to the `Settings` tab. Scroll down to the end to find the "Delete Service" option. 

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-20T01:33:01.121Z'
---

[Render](https://render.com) is a comprehensive cloud service that provides hosting for web applications and static sites, with PR previews, zero-downtime deployments, and more. Render supports full-stack applications, offering both web services and background workers.

This guide shows how to deploy a simple Node.js application connected to a Neon Postgres database on Render. 

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you will need:

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named `neondb`. We'll use this database in the following examples.
- A Render account. If you do not have one, sign up at [Render](https://render.com) to get started. 
- A GitHub account. Render integrates with public Github providers for continuous deployment. So, you'd need a GitHub account to upload your application code. 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally. 

## Setting up your Neon database

### Initialize a new project

Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) section.

- Click the `New Project` button to create a new project.

- From your project dashboard, navigate to the `SQL Editor` from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE books_to_read (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        title TEXT,
        author TEXT
    );
    ```

    Next, we insert some sample data into the `books_to_read` table, so we can query it later:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books_to_read (title, author)
    VALUES
        ('The Way of Kings', 'Brandon Sanderson'),
        ('The Name of the Wind', 'Patrick Rothfuss'),
        ('Coders at Work', 'Peter Seibel'),
        ('1984', 'George Orwell');
    ```

### Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Keep your connection string handy for later use.

## Implementing the Node.js application

We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieve the sample data from the `books_to_read` table. Run the following commands in a terminal to set it up. 

```bash
mkdir neon-render-example && cd neon-render-example
npm init -y && npm pkg set type="module"
npm install express pg
touch .env
```

We use the `npm pkg set type="module"` command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We also create a new `.env` file to store the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the `pg` library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database. 

```bash
# .env 
DATABASE_URL=NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Now, create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import pkg from "pg";

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app.use(express.json());

// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const { Pool } = pkg;
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetch books from your database using the postgres connection
    const { rows } = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM books_to_read;");
    res.json(rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch books", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the `URL`, the server queries the `books_to_read` table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON. 

We can test this application locally by running:

```bash
node --env-file=.env index.js
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to check that it returns the sample data from the `books_to_read` table.

## Push Your application to GitHub

To deploy your application to Render, you need to push your code to a GitHub repository. Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to [GitHub - New Repo](https://github.com/new). You can then push your code to the new repository using the following commands:

```bash
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore && echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "# neon-render-example" >> README.md
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

You can visit the GitHub repository to verify that your code has been pushed successfully.

## Deploying to Render

### Create a New Web Service on Render

Log in to your Render account and navigate to the dashboard. Click on the `New +` button and select "Web Service". Pick the option to `build and deploy` from a Git repository. 

Next, choose the GitHub repository hosting the Node.js application we created above. Configure your web service as follows:
    - **Environment**: Select "Node".
    - **Build Command**: Enter `npm install`.
    - **Start Command**: Enter `node index.js`.
    - **Environment Variables**: Add your Neon database connection string from earlier as an environment variable:
        - Name: `DATABASE_URL`
        - Value: `{NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING}`

Click "Create Web Service" to finish. Render will automatically deploy your application and redirect you to the service dashboard, showing the deployment progress and the logs. 

### Verify Deployment

Once the deployment completes, Render provides a public URL for accessing the web service. Visit the provided URL to verify that your application is running and can connect to your Neon database. 

Whenever you update your code and push it to your GitHub repository, Render will automatically build and deploy the changes to your web service.

## Removing Your Application and Neon Project

To remove your application from Render, navigate to the dashboard, select `Settings` for the deployed application, and scroll down to find the "Delete Web Service" option.

To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

Neon supports several options for integrating with Vercel:

- [Vercel Postgres](/docs/guides/vercel-postgres)
  
  Vercel Postgres is serverless Postgres **powered by Neon**. This integration allows you to seamlessly create and manage a serverless Postgres instance from the Vercel dashboard. A Neon account is not required.
- [The Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel)
  
  You can find the Neon Vercel Integration on the [Vercel Integration Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon). The integration connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and uses Neon's branching capability to create a database branch for each preview deployment.
- [The Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver)
  
  The Neon serverless driver allows you to query data from [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) and is a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), the popular npm `pg` package.  
- [Connect Vercel and Neon manually](/docs/guides/vercel-manual)
  
  This method involves setting Vercel environment variables to connect your Vercel Project to your Neon database.

[Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) is a collection of managed storage products that you can integrate with your frontend framework. Included in this suite of products is [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), which is serverless Postgres **powered by Neon**.

<YoutubeIframe embedId="gA8cHj3w5XI?start=122" />

Vercel Postgres is currently available in [Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/release-phases#beta) on Vercel's [Pro and Hobby plans](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/payments-and-billing/pro).

With _Vercel Postgres_, creating, deleting, and managing a Postgres instance happens in the Vercel dashboard rather than the Neon Console or using the Neon API. Furthermore, you do not need a Neon account to use Vercel Postgres. Everything is managed from Vercel.

Vercel Postgres is an alternative to using Neon directly through one of the other Vercel integration options described in the [Neon and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).

Use the following resources to get started with Vercel Postgres:

- Read [Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) for an overview of Vercel's storage suite and a brief introduction to Vercel Postgres.
- Read [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) for a full introduction. Here, you can learn about Vercel Postgres uses cases, how to get started with a preconfigured template, ORM compatibility, how Vercel Postgres works, and how to use it in your workflows.
- Follow the [Vercel Postgres Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart) to learn how to read and write data from Vercel Postgres. This guide demonstrates how to create and manage a Neon-powered Postgres database through the Vercel dashboard and populate your database using the Vercel Postgres SDK.
- Explore the [API reference for the Vercel Postgres SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/sdk). The `@vercel/postgres` SDK provides an efficient way to interact with your Postgres database. It is 100% compatible with the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) library.
- Deploy one of the [Vercel Postgres starter templates](https://vercel.com/templates?database=vercel-postgres) to start reading and writing data in minutes.
- Read [Vercel Postgres Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/limits) to learn about Vercel Postgres technical limits.
- Refer to [Vercel Postgres Pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/usage-and-pricing) to learn about the Vercel Postgres usage and pricing model.

This guide describes how to connect using the [Neon Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon) from the Vercel marketplace. The integration connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and creates a database branch for each preview deployment.


## About the Neon Vercel Integration

Vercel [preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments) enable teams to collaborate effectively by automatically creating an isolated, production-like environment for every commit. This allows changes to be previewed before they are merged into production.

However, when databases are involved, teams often use a single database containing dummy data for all preview deployments. This setup is not ideal for these reasons:

- If the shared database encounters an issue, so will all preview deployments.
- Changes to the shared database schema might break all previously created preview deployments, making it a productivity bottleneck.

![Shared database](/docs/guides/vercel_shared_database.webp)

Neonâs branching feature addresses these challenges. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data, so creating it only takes a few seconds. This makes it a scalable and cost-effective solution for preview deployments, enabling you to create a branch for each pull request.

![Branch database](/docs/guides/vercel_branch_database.webp)

When you push changes to the repository associated with your Vercel project, triggering a preview deployment, the integration automatically creates a branch in Neon and connects it to your preview deployment by setting Vercel preview environment variables. 

## Add the Neon Vercel Integration

This section describes how to add the Neon Vercel Integration to your Vercel project.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- The Neon Vercel Integration can be used with more than one Vercel project, but it can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project or connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project.
- The Neon Vercel Integration is supported with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket source code repositories.
</Admonition>

Prerequisites:

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A Vercel project. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.
- The integration initially sets the `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`environment variables for your Vercel **Production** and **Development** environments. When you create a preview deployment, the integration will also set these variables for your **Preview** environment. Variables of the same name will be overwritten. To use different Postgres variables with the Neon integration, see [Manage Vercel environment variables](#manage-vercel-environment-variables). 

To add the integration:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Vercel Integration page](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon), and click **Add integration**.
   ![Add integration](/docs/guides/vercel_add_integration.png)
1. Select a **Vercel Account** to add the integration to.
1. Select the Vercel projects to add the integration to. You can select **All Projects** or **Specific Projects** but be aware that you can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project and vice versa. By selecting **All projects**, you are simply [making the integration available to other Vercel projects](#make-the-integration-available-to-other-vercel-projects).
1. Review the permissions required by the integration, and click **Install**.
1. In the **Integrate Neon** dialog:
    1. Select a Vercel project.
      ![Select a Vercel project](/docs/guides/vercel_select_project.png)
    1. Select the Neon project that you want to connect to your Vercel project by selecting the Neon project, database, and role that Vercel will use to connect.
      ![Connect to Neon](/docs/guides/vercel_connect_neon.png)

          The **Create a branch for your development environment** option creates a branch named `vercel-dev` and sets Vercel development environment variables for it. The `vercel-dev` branch is a clone of your project's primary branch (`main`) that you can modify without affecting data on your primary branch.
         <Admonition type="note">
         Branches created for preview deployments are created from the [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch) of your Neon project. Earlier versions of the integration created branches from the initial [root branch](/docs/reference/glossary#root-branch) of your Neon project, which is designated as the primary branch by default. Neon lets you [change the primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#set-a-branch-as-primary). If you have an older version of the integration that creates branches from your project's root branch, and you want branches created from your primary branch instead, you can upgrade your integration by reinstalling it from the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon).
         </Admonition>

          When you finish making selections, click **Continue**.
    1. Confirm the integration settings. This allows the integration to:
         - Set environment variables for your Vercel project's production, development, and preview environments.
         - Create database branches for preview deployments.
         - Create a development branch for your Vercel development environment.
      ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_confirm_settings.png)
    1. Click **Connect** to confirm and proceed with the integration. If you encounter a connection error, see [Troubleshoot connection issues](#troubleshoot-connection-issues).

        After the settings are configured, you are presented with a **Success** dialog.
        ![Vercel integration success](/docs/guides/vercel_success.png)
    1. Click **Done** to complete the installation.
1. To view the results of the integration in Neon:
    1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).
    1. Select the project you are connected to.
    1. Select **Branches**.
       You will see the primary branch of your project (`main`). If you created a development branch, you will also see a `vercel-dev` branch.
       ![Neon branches](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_branches.png)
1. To view the results of the integration in Vercel:
    1. Navigate to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    1. Select the Vercel project you added the integration to.
    1. Select **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
       You should see the `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` variable settings added by the integration.
       ![Vercel environment variables](/docs/guides/vercel_env_variables.png)

   <Admonition type="note">
   The `DATABASE_URL` variable set by the integration is set to a pooled Neon database connection string. The `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` variable is set to an unpooled connection string for tools or applications that require a direct connection to the database. For more information, see [Manage Vercel environment variables](#manage-vercel-environment-variables).
   </Admonition>

## Use the Neon Vercel Integration

After you add the integration to a Vercel project, Neon creates a database branch for each preview deployment. The branch is created when you push commits made on your local branch to your application's source code repository. To see the integration in action, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch in your local source code repository.

   ```bash
   cd myapp
   git checkout -b patch-1
   ```

2. Make changes to your application on the local branch.
3. Commit the changes. For example:

   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "Update my app"
   ```

4. Push your commit to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   Pushing the commit triggers the following actions:

   - The commit triggers a preview deployment in Vercel, as would occur without the Neon integration.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_deployments.png)
   - The integration creates a branch in Neon. This branch is an isolated copy-on-write clone of your primary branch, with its own dedicated compute endpoint. The branch is created with the same name as your `git` branch.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_app_update.png)
   - The integration sets Vercel preview environment variables to connect the preview deployment to the new branch.
     ![Vercel preview settings](/docs/guides/vercel_preview_settings.png)

## Manage branches created by the integration

The Neon Vercel Integration creates a branch for each preview deployment, but it does not remove those branches automatically. To avoid using up your storage allowances or hitting branch limits, you should remove old or obsolete branches regularly.

To remove branches created by the integration:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Branches** tab.
5. Remove individual preview branches by clicking on the delete icon, or select **Delete all** to remove all preview branches.

You can also remove branches from your Neon project using the Console, CLI, or API. See [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch).

<Admonition type="note">
The latest version of the Neon integration displays a message on the **Deployment Details** page in Vercel under **Running checks** if you exceed the branch limit for your Neon project.

![Vercel branch limit](/docs/guides/vercel_branch_limit.png)
</Admonition>

## Manage integration settings

You can manage Vercel environment variables as well as the default database and role used by the integration from the Neon Console.

### Configure environment variables

The Neon Vercel Integration automatically sets the environment variables `DATABASE_URL` (pooled connection) and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (direct connection)  for your Vercel **Production** and **Development** environments. See [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) for more information. When you create a preview deployment, the integration also sets these same variables for the Vercel **Preview**  environment. If you want to define your database connection using different Postgres environment variables, the integration also supports the following:

- `PGHOST` (set to a pooled Neon database connection string)
- `PGHOST_UNPOOLED` (set to a direct Neon database connection string)
- `PGUSER`
- `PGDATABASE`
- `PGPASSWORD`

You can choose the variables you want to use from the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
4. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Settings** tab.
5. Select the environment variables you need. 
6. Click **Save changes**. Your variable selection is saved to your Vercel project and will be applied on your next deployment. Existing variables of the same name in Vercel will be overwritten. Viewing your new variable selection in Vercel may require refreshing your project's **Environment Variables** page. 

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Clicking **Redeploy** in Vercel does not apply variable changes made in Neon to your Vercel project. This only occurs with your next deployment.
- The integration appends the `sslmode=require` option to all Neon connection strings.
</Admonition> 

![Select Vercel variables](/docs/guides/vercel_select_variables.png)

### Change the database and role for preview branches

When you install the integration, you select a database and role for your Neon project. These details are used to define the database connection details in the Vercel environment variables mentioned [above](#configure-environment-variables). From the Vercel integration drawer in the Neon Console, you can choose a different database and role for new preview deployment branches.

To change the database and role for new preview deployment branches:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
3. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Settings** tab.
4. Under **Default database and role**, select a new **Database** and **Role**.

Your change will be reflected in your Vercel **Preview** environment variables on the next preview deployment.

## Disconnect the integration

If you want to disconnect the Neon Vercel Integration from your Vercel project, you can do so from the Neon Console. Disconnecting stops the integration from creating preview branches and setting environment variables for those branches in Vercel. It does not remove the integration from your Vercel project. To fully remove the integration from your Vercel project, you must do so in Vercel. See [Manage the Neon Postgres integration in Vercel](#manage-the-integration-in-vercel) for instructions.

To disconnect the Neon integration from your Vercel project:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select the **Integrations** page.
3. Find the Vercel integration under the **Manage** heading, and click **Manage**.
3. In the **Vercel integration** drawer, select the **Disconnect** tab.
4. Click **Disconnect**.

## Make the integration available to other Vercel projects

If you added the Neon Vercel Integration to a single Vercel project but would like to make it available for use with your other Vercel projects, complete the steps outlined below.

<Admonition type="important">
The Neon Vercel Integration can be used with more than one Vercel project, but it can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project or connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project. The steps below outline how to make the integration available to other Vercel projects to use with their own separate and dedicated Neon project.
</Admonition>

1. Make sure the Neon Vercel Integration that you added previously has access to the Vercel project that you want to use with the Neon Vercel Integration.
   1. On the Vercel Dashboard, select **Integrations**.
   1. Find the Neon Postgres integration, and select **Manage**.
   1. On the Neon Postgres integration page, select **Manage Access**.
   1. On the **Manage Access for Neon Postgres** modal, make sure that the Neon Postgres integration has access to the Vercel project. You can do so by selecting **Specific Projects** and choosing a Vercel project or by granting access to **All Projects**. If you previously granted access to **All Projects**, no change is necessary.
   1. Click **Save**.
1. Navigate to this URL: [https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new).
1. Follow the prompts. When you reach the **Integrate Neon** dialog, select the Vercel project you want to add the integration to. Vercel projects that are already integrated with Neon are identified as `CONNECTED`.
   ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_add_new_project.png)
1. Continue following the prompts to complete the setup. These are the same steps described above, in [Add the Neon integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). When you select a Neon project to connect to, make sure to select one that is not already connected to a Vercel project, as you cannot connect a Vercel project to multiple Neon projects or vice versa.

## Manage the integration in Vercel

To view permissions, manage which Vercel projects your integration has access to, or uninstall the Neon integration from Vercel:

1. On the Vercel dashboard, select **Settings** > **Integrations**.
1. Find the **Neon** integration and select **Configure**.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Removing the Neon Vercel Integration removes the Vercel environment variables set by the integration. It does not remove Neon branches created by the integration. To remove Neon branches, see [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch).
   </Admonition>

## Troubleshoot connection issues

This section describes commonly encountered connection issues for the Neon Vercel Integration.

### Failed to set environment variables

If the environment variables configured by the Neon integration already exist, you may encounter the following error due to an existing integration that sets one or more of the same environment variables.

```text shouldWrap
Failed to set environment variables in Vercel. Please make sure that the following environment variables are not set: PGHOST, PGUSER, PGDATABASE, PGPASSWORD, DATABASE_URL
```

In this case, you can remove or rename the existing environment variables in your Vercel project settings and retry the Neon integration.

1. From the Vercel project page, select **Settings**.
2. Locate the environment variables required by the Neon integration and remove or rename them.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Alternatively, you can remove the conflicting integration, assuming it is no longer required. This may be a previous Neon integration or another integration. Removing the integration removes the variables set by the integration.
   </Admonition>

3. Try adding the integration again. See [Add the Neon Vercel Integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration).

### DATABASE_URL not set on first preview deployment

In earlier versions of the integration, the preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is not set by the Neon Vercel Integration on the first preview deployment after adding the integration to a Vercel project.

To avoid this issue, you can reinstall the integration to update to the latest version. Alternatively, a workaround is to redeploy your preview deployment in Vercel. The preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is set on the next deployment. For redeploy instructions, see [Managing Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/managing-deployments), in the _Vercel documentation_.

This guide describes how to manually connect a Vercel project to a Neon database.

<Admonition type="note">
For other Vercel integration options, refer to the [Neon and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Neon project. If you do not have one, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A project deployed to Vercel. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.

## Gather your Neon connection details

You can these details from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

The connection string includes the role name, hostname, and database name. For example:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- <role>      |- <hostname>                                   |- <database>
```

- role name: `alex`
- hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
- database name: `dbname`

## Configure project environment variables in Vercel

The environment variables required to connect your application to Neon depend on your application. Some applications use a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with a database connection string:

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Other applications may use `PG*` environment variables to define database connection details:

```text
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.
</Admonition>

To configure the environment variables required by your application:

<Admonition type="note">
Vercel environment variables can also be configured when you first deploy an application to Vercel.
</Admonition>

1. Navigate to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/).
1. Select your Vercel project.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Environment variables**.
1. Enter the environment variable name in the **Key** field and add the value.
1. Click **Add another** if you need to add more variables.
1. Select the Vercel environments to which the variable(s) will apply (**Production**, **Preview**, **Development**).
1. Click **Save**.

![Add Vercel environment variable settings](/docs/guides/vercel_env_settings.png)

You must redeploy your application in Vercel for the environment variable settings to take effect.

title: Neon OAuth integration
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-20T13:35:56.478Z'

You can integrate your application or service with Neon using OAuth. The Neon OAuth integration enables your application to interact with Neon user accounts, carrying out permitted actions on their behalf. Our integration does not require direct access to user login credentials and is conducted with their approval, ensuring data privacy and security.

To set up the integration and create a Neon OAuth application, you can apply on our [Partners page](https://neon.tech/partners). You will need to provide the following information:

1. Details about your application, including the application name, what it does, and a link to the website.
2. Callback URL(s), which are used to redirect users after completing the authorization flow. For example `https://yourapplication.com/api/oauth/callback`, `http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback`
3. Scopes, defining the type of access you require. Currently, we provide access to the following scopes:
   - Create Projects
   - Read Projects
   - Modify Projects
   - Delete Projects
4. Whether or not you will make API calls from a backend.
5. A logo to be displayed on Neon's OAuth consent dialog when users authorize your application to access their Neon account.

After your application is reviewed, we will get in touch with you and provide you with two credentials: a client ID and a client secret. These credentials are sensitive and should be stored securely.

## How the OAuth integration works

Here is a high-level overview of how Neon's OAuth implementation works:

![OAuth flow diagram](/docs/oauth/flow.png)

1. The user initiates the OAuth flow in your application by clicking a button or link.
2. An authorization URL is generated, and the user is redirected to Neonâs OAuth consent screen to authorize the application and grant the necessary permissions.
3. The application receives an access token to manage Neon resources on the userâs behalf.

## About the Neon OAuth server

The Neon OAuth server implements the OpenID Connect protocol and supports [OpenID Connect Discovery specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). The server metadata is published at the following well-known URL: [https://oauth2.neon.tech/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://oauth2.neon.tech/.well-known/openid-configuration).

Here is an example response:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth",
  "token_endpoint": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/token",

  "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "none"],
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": ["plain", "S256"]
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
You must add `offline` and `offline_access` scopes to your request to receive the `refresh_token`.
</Admonition>

Depending on the OpenID client youâre using, you might not need to explicitly interact with the API endpoints listed below. OAuth 2.0 clients typically handle this interaction automatically. For example, the [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli), written in Typescript, interacts with the API endpoints automatically to retrieve the `refresh_token` and `access_token`. For an example, refer to this part of the Neon CLI [source code](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl/blob/main/src/auth.ts#L54-L71). In this example, the `oauthHost` is `https://oauth2.neon.tech`.

### 1. Initiating the OAuth flow

To initiate the OAuth flow, you need to generate an authorization URL. You can do that by directing your users to `https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth` while passing the following query parameters:

- `client_id`: your OAuth application's ID.
- `redirect_uri`: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
- `scope`: This is a space-separated list of scopes that you want to request access to. For example: `urn:neoncloud:projects:create urn:neoncloud:projects:read urn:neoncloud:projects:update urn:neoncloud:projects:delete`
- `response_type`: This should be set to `code` to indicate that you are using the [Authorization Code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).
- `code_challenge`: This is a random string that is used to verify the integrity of the authorization code.
- `state`: This is a random string that is returned to your callback URL. You can use this parameter to verify that the request came from your application and not from a third party.

Here is an example of what the authorization URL might look like:

```text
https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth?client_id=neon-experimental&scope=openid%20offline%20offline_access%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Acreate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aread%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aupdate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Adelete&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fneon&grant_type=authorization_code&state=H58y-rSTebc3QmNbRjNTX9dL73-IyoU2T_WNievO9as&code_challenge=99XcbwOFU6iEsvXr77Xxwsk9I0GL4c4c4Q8yPIVrF_0&code_challenge_method=S256
```

After being redirected to the authorization URL, the user is presented with Neon's consent screen, which is pre-populated with the scopes you requested. From the consent screen, the user is able to review the scopes and authorize the application to connect their Neon account.

![Neon OAuth consent screen](/docs/oauth/consent.png)

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon API provides a [Get current user details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getcurrentuserinfo) endpoint for retrieving information about the currently authorized Neon user.
</Admonition>

### 2. Authorization code is returned to your callback URL

After successfully completing the authorization flow, the user is redirected to the callback URL with the following query parameters appended to the URL:

- `code`: an authorization code that will be exchanged for an access token
- `scope`: the scopes that the user authorized your application to access
- `state`: you can compare the value of this parameter with the original `state` you provided in the previous step to ensure that the request came from your application and not from a third party

### 3. Exchanging the authorization code for an access token

You can now exchange the authorization code returned from the previous step for an access token. To do that, you need to send a `POST` request to `https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/token` with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: your OAuth application's ID.
- `redirect_uri`: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
- `client_secret`: your OAuth application's secret
- `grant_type`: set this to `authorization_code` to indicate that you are using the [Authorization Code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
- `code`: the authorization code returned from the previous step

The response object includes an `access_token` value, required for making requests to the Neon API on your users' behalf. This value must be supplied in the Authorization header of the HTTP request when sending requests to the Neon API.

## Example OAuth applications

The [Visualizing Neon Database Branches](https://neon-experimental.vercel.app) application leverages the Neon OAuth integration. You can find the example application code on GitHub.

# Manage billing with quotas

title: Manage billing with consumption limits
subtitle: Learn how to set usage quotas per project with the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
isDraft: false
updatedOn: '2024-02-22T14:29:54.382Z'
---

When setting up your billing solution with Neon, you may want to impose some hard limits on how much storage or compute resources a given project can consume. For example, you may want to cap how much usage your free tier users can consume versus pro or enterprise users. With the Neon API, you can use the `quota` key to set usage limits for a variety of consumption metrics. These limits act as thresholds after which all active computes for a project are [suspended](#suspending-active-computes).

## Metrics and quotas

By default, Neon tracks a variety of consumption metrics at the project level. If you want to set quotas (max limits) for these metrics, you need to explicitly [configure](#configuring-quotas) them.

### Available metrics

Here are the relevant metrics that you can track in order to understand your users' current consumption levels.

#### Project-level metrics

- `active_time_seconds`
- `compute_time_seconds`
- `written_data_bytes`
- `data_transfer_bytes`

These consumption metrics represent total cumulative usage across all branches and computes in a given project, accrued so far in a given monthly billing period. Metrics are refreshed on the first day of the following month, when the new billing period starts.

#### Branch-level metric

There is an additional value that you also might want to track: `logical_size`, which gives you the current size of a particular branch.

Neon updates all metrics every 15 minutes but it could take up to 1 hour before they are reportable.

To find the current usage level for any of these metrics, see [retrieving details about a project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project). You can read more about these metrics and how they impact billing [here](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics).

### Corresponding quotas

You can set quotas for these consumption metrics per project using the `quote` object in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) or [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) API.

The `quota` object includes an array of parameters used to set threshold limits. Their names generally match their corresponding metric:

- `active_time_seconds` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of time your project's total compute endpoints are allowed to be active during the current billing period. It excludes time when computes are in an `Idle` state due to [auto-suspension](/docs/reference/glossary#autosuspend-compute).
- `compute_time_seconds` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of CPU seconds allowed in total across all of a project's compute endpoints. This includes any endpoints deleted during the current billing period. Note that the larger the compute size per endpoint, the faster the project consumes `compute_time_seconds`. For example, 1 second at .25 vCPU costs .25 compute seconds, while 1 second at 4 vCPU costs 4 compute seconds.
   | vCPUs  | active_time_seconds | compute_time_seconds |
   |--------|-----------------------|------------------------|
   | 0.25   | 1                     | 0.25                   |
   | 4      | 1                     | 4                      |
- `written_data_bytes` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of data in total, measured in bytes, that can be written across all of a project's branches for the month.
- `data_transfer_bytes` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of egress data, measured in bytes, that can be transferred out of Neon from across all of a project's branches using the proxy.

There is one additional `quota` parameter, `logical_size_bytes`, which applies to individual branches, not to the overall project. You can use `logical_size_bytes` to set the maximum size (measured in bytes) that any one individual branch is allowed to reach. Once this threshold is met, the compute for that particular branch (and _only_ that particular branch) is suspended. Note that this limit is _not_ refreshed once per month: it is a strict size limit that applies for the life of the branch.

### Sample quotas

Let's say you want to set limits for an application with two tiers, Trial and Pro, you might set limits like the following:

| Parameter (project)  | Trial (.25 vCPU)                 | Pro (max 4 vCPU)                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| active_time_seconds  | 633,600 (business month 22 days) | 2,592,000 (30 days)                              |
| compute_time_seconds | 158,400 (approx 44 hours)        | 10,368,000 (4 times the active hours for 4 vCPUs) |
| written_data_bytes   | 1,000,000,000 (approx. 1 GiB)    | 50,000,000,000 (approx. 50 GiB)                  |
| data_transfer_bytes  | 500,000,000 (approx. 500 MiB)    | 10,000,000,000 (approx. 10 GiB)                  |

| Parameter (branch) | Trial                         | Pro                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| logical_size_bytes | 100,000,000 (approx. 100 MiB) | 10,000,000,000 (approx. 10 GiB) |

### Guidelines

Generally, the most effective quotas for controlling spend per project are those controlling maximum compute (`active_time_seconds` and `compute_time_seconds`) and maximum written storage (`written_data_bytes`). In practice, it is possible that `data_transfer_bytes` could introduce unintended logical constraints against your usage. For example, let's say you want to run a cleanup operation to reduce your storage. If part of this cleanup operation involves moving data across the network (for instance, to create an offsite backup before deletion), the `data_transfer_bytes` limit could prevent you from completing the operation &#8212; an undesirable situation where two measures meant to control cost interfere with one another.

### Neon Default Limits

In addition to the configurable limits that you can set, Neon also sets certain branch size limits by default. You might notice these limits in a [Get Project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project) response:

- `branch_logical_size_limit` (MiB)
- `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes`(Bytes)

These limits are not directly configurable. They act as "failsafe" limits to prevent runaway branch size growth due to possible issues with your application. If you need larger limits here, contact Neon Support.

For Neon Free Tier users, the logical data size limit is approximately 3 GiB per branch:
- `branch_logical_size_limit`: 3072
- `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes:` 3221225472

For Neon Pro Tier users, the limit is approximately 200 GiB per branch:

- `branch_logical_size_limit`: 204800
- `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes`: 214748364800

## Suspending active computes

_**What happens when the quota is met?**_

When any configured metric reaches its quota limit, all active computes for that project are automatically suspended. It is important to understand, this suspension is persistent. It works differently than the inactivity-based [autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide), where computes restart at the next interaction: this suspend will _not_ restart at the next API call or incoming connection. If you don't take explicit action otherwise, the suspension remains in place until the end of the current billing period starts (`consumption_period_end`).

See [Querying metrics and quotas](#querying-metrics-and-quotas) to find your reset date, billing period, and other values related to the project's consumption.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon tracks these consumption metrics on a monthly cycle. If you want to track metrics on a different cycle, you need to take snapshots of your metrics at the desired interval and store the data externally. You can also use the Preview [Consumption API](#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) to collect metrics from across a range of billing periods.
</Admonition>

## Configuring quotas

You can set quotas using the Neon API either in a `POST` when you create a project or a `PATCH` to update an existing project:

- [Set quotas when you create the project](#set-quotas-when-you-create-the-project)
- [Update an existing project](#update-an-existing-project)

### Set quotas when you create the project

For performance reasons, you might want to configure these quotas at the same time that you create a new project for your user using the [Create a project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API, reducing the number of API calls you need to make.

Here is a sample `POST` in `curl` that creates a new project called `UserNew` and sets the `active_time_seconds` quota to a total allowed time of 10 hours (36,000 seconds) for the month, and a total allowed `compute_time_seconds` set to 2.5 hours (9,000 seconds) for the month. This 4:1 ratio between active and compute time is suitable for a fixed compute size of 0.25 vCPU.

```bash {11,12}
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "quota": {
        "active_time_seconds": 36000,
        "compute_time_seconds": 9000
      }
    },
    "pg_version": 15,
    "name": "UserProject"
  }
}
' | jq
```

### Update an existing project

If you need to change the quota limits for an existing project &#8212; for example, if a user switches their plan to a higher usage tier &#8212; you can reset those limits via `PATCH` request. See [Update a project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) in the Neon API.

Here is a sample `PATCH` that updates both the `active_time_seconds` and `compute_time_seconds` quotas to 30 hours (108,000):

```bash {11,12}
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/[project_ID]\
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "quota": {
        "active_time_seconds": 108000,
        "compute_time_seconds": 108000
      }
    }
  }
}
' | jq

You can get metrics and quota details for a single project or a list of metrics for all projects at once:

- [Per project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project)
- [All projects](#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects)

### Retrieving details about a project

Using a `GET` request from the Neon API (see [Get project details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getproject)), you can find the following consumption details for a given project:

- Current consumption metrics accumulated for the billing period
- Start and end dates for the billing period
- Current usage quotas (max limits) configured for the project

Using these details, you can set up the logic for when to send notification warnings, when to reset a quota, and other possible actions related to the pending or current suspension of a project's active computes.

Here is an example a `GET` request for an individual project.

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/[project_ID] \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

And here is what the response might look like. The key fields are highlighted.

Looking at this response, here are some conclusions we can draw:

- **This project is _1 hour away_ from being suspended.**

  With current `compute_time_seconds` at _68,400_ (19 hours) and the quota for that metric set at _72,000_ (20 hours), the project is only _1 hour_ of compute time away from being suspended.

- **This project is _1 day away_ from a quota refresh.**

  If today's date is _October 31st, 2023_, and the `consumption_period_end` parameter is _2023-11-01T00:00:00Z_ (November 1st, 2023), then the project has _1 day_ left before all quota parameters (except for `logical_byte_size`) are refreshed.

### Retrieving metrics for all projects

Instead of retrieving metrics for a single project per request, you can use the [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption) to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. You can specify a date range to get metrics from across multiple billing periods and control pagination for large result sets.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Preview API">
This functionality is part of the preview API and is subject to change in the future.
</Admonition>

Here is the URL in the Neon API where you can get details for all projects in your account:

```bash
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption/projects
```

This API endpoint accepts the following query parameters: `from`,`to`, `limit`, and `cursor`.

#### Set a date range across multiple billing periods

You can set `from` and `to` query parameters to define a time range that can span across multiple billing periods.

- `from` â Sets the start date and time of the time period for which you are seeking metrics.
- `to` â Sets the end date and time for the the interval for which you desire metrics.

The response is organized by project and billing period: one object per project, per active billing period within the range. For example, if you choose a 6-month time range you will get up to 6 objects for every project active within those months. The response includes any projects deleted within that time range.

If you do not include these parameters, the query defaults to the current consumption period.

Here is an example query that returns metrics from September 1st and December 1st, 2023. Time values must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/).

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption/projects?limit=10&from=2023-09-01T00%3A00%3A00Z&to=2023-12-01T00%3A00%3A00Z' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

Key details:

- The `period_id` key and `previous_period_id` are unique values used to identify and connect periods across the time range.
- The `period_start` and `period_end` keys show the dates for that particular billing period. A `null` value indicates that the object is for the current billing period.
- The `cursor` object under `pagination` shows the last project Id in the response. See more about pagination in the next section.

#### Control pagination for large result sets

To control pagination (number of results per response), you can include these query parameters:

- `limit` &#8212; sets the number of project objects to be included in the response
- `cursor` &#8212; by default, the response uses the project `id` from the last project in the list as the `cursor` value (included in the `pagination` object at the end of the response). Generally, it is up to the application to collect and use this cursor value when setting up the next request.

Here is an example `GET` request asking for the next 100 projects, starting with project id `divine-tree-77657175`:

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption/projects?cursor=divine-tree-77657175&limit=100\
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \

## Resetting a project after suspend

Projects remain suspended until the next billing period. It is good practice to notify your users when they are close to reaching a limit; if the user is then suspended and loses access to their database, it will not be unexpected. If you have configured no further actions, the user will have to wait until the next billing period starts to resume usage.

Alternatively, you can actively reset a suspended compute by changing the impacted quota to `0`: this effectively removes the limit entirely. You will need to reset this quota at some point if you want to maintain limits.

### Using quotas to actively suspend a user

If you want to suspend a user for any reason &#8212; for example, suspicious activity or payment issues &#8212; you can use these quotas to actively suspend a given user. For example, setting `active_time_limit` to a very low threshold (e.g., `1`) will force a suspension if the user has 1 second of active compute for that month. To remove this suspension, you can set the threshold temporarily to `0` (infinite) or some value larger than their currently consumed usage.

## Other consumption related settings

In addition to setting quota limits against the project as a whole, there are other sizing-related settings you might want to use to control the amount of resources any particular endpoint is able to consume:

- `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` &#8212; Sets the minimium compute size for the endpoint. The default minimum is .25 vCPU but can be increased if your user's project could benefit from a larger compute start size.
- `autoscaling_limit_max_cu` &#8212; Sets a hard limit on how much compute an endpoint can consume in response to increased demand. For more info on min and max cpu limits, see [Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).
- `suspend_timeout_seconds` &#8212; Sets how long an endpoint's allotted compute will remain active with no current demand. After the timeout period, the endpoint is suspended until demand picks up. For more info, see [Autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

There are several ways you can set these endpoint settings using the Neon API: you can set project-level defaults that apply for any new computes created in the project, you can define the endpoint settings when creating a new branch, or you can adjust these settings when creating or updating an endpoint for an existing branch.

See these sample CURL requests for each method.

<Tabs labels={["Project", "Branch","Endpoint"]}>

<TabItem>
In this sample, we are setting defaults for all new endpoints created in the project as a whole. The minimum compute size is at **1 vCPU**, the max size at **3 vCPU**, and a 10 minute (**600 seconds**) inactivty period before the endpoint is suspended.

These default values are set in the
`default_endpoint_settings` object.

```bash {9-12}
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \

Vector databases enable efficient storage and retrieval of vector data, which is an essential component in building AI applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI.

Neon supports the `pgvector` open-source extension, which enables Postgres as a vector database for storing and querying vector embeddings. By enabling Postgres as a vector database, you can keep your data in the open source database that you know and trust. There's no need for data migration or a proprietary vector storage solution.

To get started, see [The pgvector extension](/docs/extensions/pgvector).

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T10:43:33.357Z'

Embeddings are an essential component in building AI applications. Ths topic describes embeddings and how they are used in building AI and LLM applications.

## What are embeddings?

When working with unstructured data, a common objective is to transform it into a more structured format that is easier to analyze and retrieve. This transformation can be achieved through the use of 'embeddings', which are vectors containing an array of floating-point numbers that represent the features or dimensions of the data. For example, a sentence like "The cow jumped over the moon" could be represented by an embedding that looks like this: [0.5, 0.3, 0.1].

The advantage of embeddings is that they allow us to measure the similarity between different pieces of text. By calculating the distance between two embeddings, we can assess their relatedness - the smaller the distance, the greater the similarity, and vice versa. This quality is particularly useful as it enables embeddings to capture the underlying meaning of the text.

Take the following three sentences, for example:

- Sentence 1: "The cow jumped over the moon."
- Sentence 2: "The bovine leapt above the celestial body."
- Sentence 3: "I enjoy eating pancakes."

You can determine the most similar sentences by following these steps:

1. Generate embeddings for each sentence. For illustrative purposes, assume these values represent actual embeddings:

    - Embedding for sentence 1 â [0.5, 0.3, 0.1]
    - Embedding for sentence 2 â [0.6, 0.29, 0.12]
    - Embedding for sentence 3 â [0.1, -0.2, 0.4]

2. Compute the distance between all pairs of embeddings (1 & 2, 2 & 3, and 1 & 3).

3. Identify the pair of embeddings with the shortest distance between them.

When we apply this process, it is likely that sentences 1 and 2, both of which involve bounding cattle, would emerge as the most related according to a distance calculation.

## Vector similarity search

The method of transforming data into embeddings and computing similarities between one or more items is referred to as vector search or similarity search. This process has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

- **Information retrieval:** By representing user queries as vectors, we can perform more accurate searches based on the meaning behind the queries, allowing us to retrieve more relevant information.
- **Natural language processing:** Embeddings capture the essence of the text, making them excellent tools for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Recommendation systems:** Using vector similarity, we can recommend items that are similar to a given item, whether they be movies, products, books, or otherwise. This technique allows us to create more personalized and relevant recommendations.
- **Anomaly detection:** By determining the similarity between items within a dataset, we can identify outliers or anomaliesâitems that don't quite fit the pattern. This can be crucial in many fields, from cybersecurity to quality control.

### Distance metrics

Vector similarity search computes similarities (the distance) between data points. Calculating how 'far apart' data points are helps us understand the relationship between them. Distance can be computed in different ways using different metrics. Some popular distance metrics include:

- Euclidean (L2): Often referred to as the "ordinary" distance you'd measure with a ruler.
- Manhattan (L1): Also known as "taxicab" or "city block" distance.
- Cosine: This calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

Different distance metrics can be more appropriate for different tasks, depending on the nature of the data and the specific relationships you're interested in. For instance, cosine similarity is often used in text analysis.

## Generating embeddings

A common approach to generate embeddings is to use OpenAIâs Embeddings API. This API allows you to input a text string into an API endpoint, which then returns the corresponding embedding. The "cow jumped over the moon" example above is a simplistic example with 3 dimensions. Most embedding models generate a much larger number of embeddings. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model, for example, generates 1536 embeddings.

Here's an example of how to use OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate an embedding:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "text-embedding-ada-002"
  }'
```

<Admonition type="note">
Running the command above requires an OpenAI API key, which must be obtained from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
</Admonition>

Upon successful execution, you'll receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "index": 0,
      "embedding": [
        -0.007009038,
        -0.0053659794,
        ...
        -0.00010458116,
        -0.024071306
      ]
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-ada-002-v2",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 5,
    "total_tokens": 5
  }
}
```

To learn more about OpenAI's embeddings, see [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## Storing vector embeddings in Postgres

Neon supports the [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) and [pg_embedding](/docs/extensions/pg_embedding) Postgres extensions, which enable storing and retrieving vector embeddings directly within your Postgres database. When building AI and LLM applications, installing either of these extensions eliminates the need to build out your architecture to include a separate vector store.

After installing an extension, you can create a table to store your embeddings. For example, if you install the `pgvector` extension, you might define a table similar to the following to store your embeddings:

```sql
CREATE TABLE items(id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, embedding VECTOR(1536));
```

To add embeddings to the table, you would insert the data as shown:

```sql
INSERT INTO items(embedding) VALUES ('[
    -0.006929283495992422,
    -0.005336422007530928,
    ...
    -4.547132266452536e-05,
    -0.024047505110502243
]');
```

## Building AI apps with embeddings

The concepts described above provide an introduction to the basic building blocks for developing an AI application with embeddings. You can see how they fit with the general process, which involves these steps:

1. Generate embeddings from your data
2. Store the embeddings in your database
3. Build an interface that prompts for user for input
4. Generate an embedding for the provided user input
5. Perform a similarity search that compares the embedding generated for the provided input against the embeddings stored in your database
6. Return the most similar data to the user

For example applications built based on this general process, see the following:

Neon offers the following features enabling you to build scalable AI and LLM applications that meet workload demand while managing costs.

## Autoscaling

With Neon, you do not have to pick a size for your database upfront. Neon can automatically allocate compute resources to meet demand. This is made possible by Neonâs architecture, which separates storage and compute, allowing compute resources to be managed independently.

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature automatically scales up compute on demand in response to application workload and down to zero on inactivity, and you are only charged for the compute resources you use.

For example, if your AI application experiences heavy load during certain hours of the day or at different times throughout the week, month, or calendar year, Neon automatically scales compute resources without manual intervention according to the compute size boundaries that you configure. This enables you to handle peak demand while avoiding paying for compute resources during periods of low activity.

To learn more about Neon's Autoscaling feature and how to enable it, refer to our [Autoscaling guide](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Read replicas

Neon supports regional read replicas, which are independent read-only compute instances designed to perform read operations on the same data as your read-write computes. Read replicas do not replicate data across database instances. Instead, read requests are directed to a single source. This architecture enables read replicas to be created instantly, and because data is read from a single source, there are additional storage costs.

Since vector similarity search is a read-only workload, you can leverage read replicas to offload reads from your read-write compute instance to a dedicated read-only compute when deploying AI and LLM applications. After you create a read replica, you can simply swap out your current Neon database connecting string for the read replica connection string, which makes deploying a read replica for your AI application very simple.

To learn more about the Neon read replica feature, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) and refer to our [Working with Neon read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) guide.

## The Neon serverless driver

Neon supports a low-latency serverless Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript applications that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP.

The driver is a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), the popular `npm pg` package you may already be familiar with.

With the Neon serverless driver, you can reduce query latencies for your AI applications, making it possible to achieve sub-10ms Postgres queries when querying from Edge functions.

See [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to learn more.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.
You can use Google Colab to run python code through the browser.

This guide shows how to create a notebook in Colab, connect to a Neon database, install the `pgvector` extension to enabled Neon as a vector store, and run a vector search query.

## Prerequisites

To perform the steps in this guide, you require a Neon database for storing vectors. You can use the ready-to-use `neondb` database or create your own. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Retrieve your database connection string

In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

## Create a notebook

In your browser, navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and click **New notebook**.

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

## Connect to your database

1. In your Colab notebook, create a code block to define your database connection and create a cursor object. Replace `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]` with the database connection string you retrieved in the previous step.

    ```python shouldWrap
    import os
    import psycopg2

    # Provide your Neon connection string
    connection_string = "postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]"

    # Connect using the connection string
    connection = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)

    # Create a new cursor object
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    ```

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

3. Add a code block for testing the database connection.

    ```python
    # Execute this query to test the database connection
    cursor.execute("SELECT 1;")
    result = cursor.fetchone()

    # Check the query result
    if result == (1,):
        print("Your database connection was successful!")
    else:
        print("Your connection failed.")
    ```

4. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Install the pgvector extension

1. Create a codeblock to install the `pgvector` extension to enable your Neon database as a vector store:

    ```python
    # Execute this query to install the pgvector extension
    cursor.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;")
    ```

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Create a table and add vector data

1. Add a code block to create a table and insert data:

    ```python shouldWrap
    create_table_sql = '''
    CREATE TABLE items (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding VECTOR(3)
    );
    '''

    # Insert data
    insert_data_sql = '''
    INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]'), ('[7,8,9]');
    '''

    # Execute the SQL statements
    cursor.execute(create_table_sql)
    cursor.execute(insert_data_sql)

    # Commit the changes
    connection.commit()
    ```

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Query your data

1. Add a codeblock to perform a vector similarity search.

    ```python shouldWrap
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 3;")
    all_data = cursor.fetchall()
    print(all_data)
    ```

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

title: Postgres Array Data Type
subtitle: Manage collections of elements using arrays
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-03T13:30:12.163Z'
---

In Postgres, the `ARRAY` data type is used to store and manipulate collections of elements in a single column. An array can have variable length and one or more dimensions, but must hold elements of the same data type. Postgres provides a variety of functions and operators for working with arrays.

Arrays are particularly useful when dealing with multiple values that are logically related. For instance, they can store a list of phone numbers for a contact, product categories for an e-commerce item, or even multi-dimensional data for scientific or analytical computations.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

Arrays in Postgres are declared by specifying the element type followed by square brackets. For example,
- `INTEGER[]` defines an array of integers.
- `TEXT[][]` defines a two-dimensional array of text values.
- `NUMERIC[3]` defines an array of three numeric values. However, note that Postgres doesn't enforce the specified size of an array.

Array literals in Postgres are written within curly braces `{}` and separated by commas. For instance,
- An array of integers might look like `{1, 2, 3}`.
- Multidimensional arrays use nested curly braces, like `{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}`.

The `ARRAY` constructor syntax can also be used to create arrays. For example,
- `ARRAY[1, 2, 3]` creates an array of integers.
- `ARRAY[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` creates a two-dimensional array.

## Example usage

Consider the case of maintaining a product catalog for an online store. The same product may belong to multiple categories. For example,  an iPad could be tagged as 'Electronics', 'Computer', or 'Mobile'. In this case, we can use an array to store the categories for each product.

First, let's create a `products` table with some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    categories TEXT[],
    units_sold INTEGER[][]
);

INSERT INTO products (name, categories, units_sold)
VALUES
    ('Laptop', '{"Electronics","Computer","Office"}', '{{3200, 3300, 3400, 3500}, {3600, 3700, 3800, 3900}}'),
    ('Headphones', '{"Electronics","Audio"}', '{{2400, 2500, 2600, 2700}, {2800, 2900, 3000, 3100}}'),
    ('Table', '{"Furniture","Office"}', '{{900, 950, 1000, 1050}, {1100, 1150, 1200, 1250}}'),
    ('Keyboard', '{"Electronics","Accessories"}', '{{4100, 4200, 4300, 4400}, {4500, 4600, 4700, 4800}}');
```

The `units_sold` column is a two-dimensional array that stores the number of units sold for each product. The first dimension represents the year, and the second dimension represents the quarter.

Now, we can access the values in the array column `categories`, and use it in our queries. For example, the query below finds products belonging to the `Electronics` category.

```sql
SELECT name, categories
FROM products
WHERE 'Electronics' = ANY (categories);
```

Note that the `ANY` operator checks if the value specified exists in the array.
This query returns the following result:

```text
| id | name       | categories                      |
|----|------------|---------------------------------|
| 1  | Laptop     | {Electronics, Computer, Office} |
| 2  | Headphones | {Electronics, Audio}            |
| 4  | Keyboard   | {Electronics, Accessories}      |
```

## Other examples

### Indexing arrays

Elements in an array can be accessed by their index. Postgres arrays are 1-based, meaning indexing starts at 1.

For example, to get the first category of each product:

```sql
SELECT name, categories[1] AS first_category
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| name       | first_category |
|------------|----------------|
| Laptop     | Electronics    |
| Headphones | Electronics    |
| Table      | Furniture      |
| Keyboard   | Electronics    |
```

Multiple elements can be accessed using the `SLICE` operator. For example, to get the first three categories of each product:

```sql
SELECT name, categories[1:3] AS first_three_categories
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| name       | first_three_categories          |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| Laptop     | {Electronics, Computer, Office} |
| Headphones | {Electronics, Audio}            |
| Table      | {Furniture, Office}             |
| Keyboard   | {Electronics, Accessories}      |
```

Multidimensional arrays can be accessed using multiple indices. For example, to get the number of units sold in the last quarter of the first year for each product, we can use the query:

```sql
SELECT name, units_sold[1][4] AS units_sold_last_quarter
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| name       | units_sold_last_quarter |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Laptop     | 3500                    |
| Headphones | 2700                    |
| Table      | 1050                    |
| Keyboard   | 4400                    |
```

### Modifying arrays

Array values can be modified using functions or by directly indexing into the array. You can change specific elements of an array, add or remove elements, or even replace the entire array.

For example, the query below replaces the `Audio` category across all products with `Sound`.

```sql
UPDATE products
SET categories = array_replace(categories, 'Audio', 'Sound')
WHERE 'Audio' = ANY (categories)
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| id | name       | categories            | units_sold                                   |
|----|------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 2  | Headphones | {Electronics,Sound}   | {{2400,2500,2600,2700},{2800,2900,3000,3100}} |
```

### Array functions and operators

Postgres provides a variety of functions and operators for working with arrays. You can find the full list of functions and operators in the [Postgres documentation](#resources).

We'll look at some commonly used functions below.

**Length of an array**

We can query the number of categories each product has been tagged with:

```sql
SELECT name, array_length(categories, 1) as category_count
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| name       | category_count |
|------------|----------------|
| Laptop     | 3              |
| Headphones | 3              |
| Table      | 2              |
| Keyboard   | 2              |
```

The `array_length` function returns the length of the array in the specified dimension. In this case, we specified the first dimension, which is the number of categories for each product.

**Expanding an array into rows**

We can use the `unnest` function to expand an array into rows. For example, to get the number of laptops sold in each quarter, we can use the query:

```sql
SELECT name, unnest(units_sold) AS units_sold
FROM products
WHERE name = 'Laptop';
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| name   | units_sold |
|--------|------------|
| Laptop | 3200       |
| Laptop | 3300       |
| Laptop | 3400       |
| Laptop | 3500       |
| Laptop | 3600       |
| Laptop | 3700       |
| Laptop | 3800       |
| Laptop | 3900       |
```

We could use the output of `unnest` to calculate the total number of units sold for each product; for example:

```sql
WITH table_units AS (
  SELECT name, unnest(units_sold) AS total_units_sold
  FROM products
)
SELECT name, sum(total_units_sold)
FROM table_units
GROUP BY name;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| name       | sum   |
|------------|-------|
| Keyboard   | 35600 |
| Table      | 8600  |
| Laptop     | 28400 |
| Headphones | 22000 |
```

**Concatenating arrays**

We can concatenate two arrays using the `||` operator. For example, the query below produces a list of all categories across all products.

```sql
SELECT ARRAY[1,2,3] || ARRAY[4,5] as concatenated_array;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| concatenated_array |
|--------------------|
| {1,2,3,4,5}        |
```

**Aggregating values into an array**

We can use the `array_agg` function to produce an array from a set of rows. For example, to get a list of all products that are in the `Electronics` category, we can use the query:

```sql
SELECT array_agg(name) AS product_names
FROM products
WHERE 'Electronics' = ANY (categories);
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| product_names                |
|------------------------------|
| {Laptop,Headphones,Keyboard} |
```

## Additional considerations

- **Performance and UX**: While arrays provide flexibility, they can be less performant than normalized data structures for large datasets. Compared to a set of rows, arrays can also be more tedious to work with for complex queries. 

- **Indexing**: Postgres lets you create indexes on array elements for faster searches. Specifically, an inverted index like `GIN` creates an entry for each element in the array. This allows for fast lookups but can be expensive to maintain for large arrays.

- **No type enforcement**: Postgres supports defining the size of an array or the number of dimensions in the schema. However, Postgres does not enforce these definitions. For example, the query below works successfully:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE test_size (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      arr1 INTEGER[3]
    );
    INSERT INTO test_size (arr1)
    VALUES (ARRAY[1,2,3]), (ARRAY[1,2]);
    ```

    It is therefore up to the application to ensure data integrity.

# Boolean

---
title: Postgres Boolean data type
subtitle: Representing truth values in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.383Z'
---

In Postgres, the Boolean datatype is designed to store truth values. A Boolean column can hold one of three states: `true`, `false`, or `NULL` representing unknown or missing values. 

For instance, Boolean values can be used in a dataset to represent the status of an order, whether a user is active, or whether a product is in stock. A Boolean value could also be produced as a result of comparisons or logical operations.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

In SQL statements, Boolean values are represented by the keywords `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL`. Postgres is flexible and allows for various textual representations of these values:

- `TRUE` can also be represented as `t`, `true`, `y`, `yes`, `on`, `1`.
- `FALSE` can also be represented as `f`, `false`, `n`, `no`, `off`, `0`.

A boolean value is stored as a single byte. 

## Example usage

Consider a table of users for a web application. We can add a Boolean column to represent whether a user is active or not. 

The query below creates a `users` table and inserts some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN,
    has_paid_subscription BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO users (username, is_active, has_paid_subscription)
VALUES 
    ('alice', TRUE, TRUE),
    ('bob', TRUE, FALSE),
    ('charlie', FALSE, TRUE),
    ('david', NULL, NULL),
    ('eve', FALSE, FALSE);
```

Say we want to find all the users currently active on the website. The `WHERE` clause accepts a Boolean expression, so we can filter down to the rows where the `is_active` column is `TRUE`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | username | is_active | has_paid_subscription |
|----|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| 1  | alice    | t         | t                     |
| 2  | bob      | t         | f                     |
```

## Other examples

### Conditional logic

Boolean data types are commonly used in conditional statements like `WHERE`, `IF`, and `CASE`. For example, the `CASE` statement is a control flow structure that allows you to perform `IF-THEN-ELSE` logic in SQL. 

In the query below, we categorize users based on their activity and account type. 

```sql
SELECT username,
    CASE
        WHEN is_active = TRUE AND has_paid_subscription = TRUE THEN 'Active Paid'
        WHEN is_active = TRUE AND has_paid_subscription = FALSE THEN 'Active Free'
        WHEN is_active = FALSE AND has_paid_subscription = TRUE THEN 'Inactive Paid'
        WHEN is_active = FALSE AND has_paid_subscription = FALSE THEN 'Inactive Free'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS user_status
FROM users;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| username | user_status   |
|----------|---------------|
| alice    | Active Paid   |
| bob      | Active Free   |
| charlie  | Inactive Paid |
| david    | Unknown       |
| eve      | Inactive Free |
```

### Boolean expressions

Boolean expressions combine multiple boolean values using operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. These expressions return boolean values and are crucial in complex SQL queries. 

For example, we can use a Boolean expression to find all the users who are active but don't have a paid subscription yet.

```sql
SELECT id, username
FROM users
WHERE is_active = TRUE AND has_paid_subscription = FALSE;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | username |
|----|----------|
| 2  | bob      |
```

### Boolean aggregations

Postgres also supports aggregating over a set of Boolean values, using functions like `bool_and()` and `bool_or()`. 

For example, we can query to check that no inactive users have a paid subscription. 

```sql
SELECT bool_or(has_paid_subscription) AS inactive_paid_users
FROM users
WHERE is_active = FALSE;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| inactive_paid_users |
|---------------------|
| t                   |
```

This indicates there is at least one inactive user with an ongoing subscription. We should probably email them a reminder to log in. 

### Boolean in join conditions

Booleans can be effectively used in the `JOIN` clause to match rows across tables. 

In the query below, we join the `users` table with the table containing contact information to send a promotional email to all active users. 

```sql
WITH contacts (user_id, email) AS (
    VALUES
    (1, 'alice@email.com'),
    (2, 'bob@email.com'),
    (3, 'charlie@email.com'),
    (4, 'david@email.com'),
    (5, 'eve@email.com')
)
SELECT u.id, u.username, c.email
FROM users u
JOIN contacts c ON u.id = c.user_id AND u.is_active = TRUE;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | username | email           |
|----|----------|-----------------|
| 1  | alice    | alice@email.com |
| 2  | bob      | bob@email.com   |
```

## Additional considerations

- **NULL**: `NULL` in boolean terms indicates an unknown state, which is neither `TRUE` nor `FALSE`. In conditional statements, `NULL` values will not equate to `FALSE`.
- **Type Casting**: Be mindful when converting Booleans to other data types. For instance, casting a Boolean to an integer results in `1` for `TRUE` and `0` for `FALSE`. This behavior is useful in aggregations or mathematical operations.
- **Indexing**: Using Booleans in indexing might not always be efficient, especially if the distribution of true and false values is uneven.

# Date and time

---
title: Postgres Date and Time Data Types
subtitle: Work with date and time values in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-04T17:39:41.493Z'
---

Postgres offers a rich set of native data types for storing date and time values. Both moment-in-time and interval data can be stored, and Postgres provides a variety of functions to query and manipulate them. 

Modeling date and time enables precise timestamping, duration calculations, and is essential in various use cases related to finance, logistics, events logging, and so on. 

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

There are 5 primary date/time types in Postgres:

- `DATE` - represents a date value, stored as 4 bytes. Resolution is 1 day.
- `TIME` - represents a time-of-day value, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond.
- `TIMESTAMP` - represents a combined date and time value, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond.
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` - represents a combined date and time value, along with time zone information, stored as 8 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond. It is stored internally as a UTC value, but is displayed in the timezone set by the client.
- `INTERVAL` - represents a duration of time, stored as 16 bytes. Resolution is 1 microsecond. Optionally, you can restrict the set of values stored to a larger unit of time (e.g., `INTERVAL MONTH`). 

Date/time values are specified as string literals. Postgres accepts most of the standard datetime formats. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
    '2024-01-01'::DATE AS date_value,
    '09:00:00'::TIME AS time_value,
    '2024-01-01 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP AS timestamp_value,
    '2024-01-01 09:00:00-05'::TIMESTAMPTZ AS timestamptz_value,
    '1 month'::INTERVAL AS interval_value;
```

There are also some special date/time literals that can be used in queries. Some of them are:

- `epoch` - represents the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
- `infinity` - represents an infinite timestamp, greater than all other timestamps
- `-infinity` - represents an infinite timestamp, smaller than all other timestamps
- `now` - represents the current timestamp

## Example usage

Consider a conference event management system that tracks schedules for planned sessions. 

The query below creates a table to store all the sessions and inserts some sample data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE conference_sessions (
    session_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_date DATE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    planned_duration INTERVAL NOT NULL,
    finish_time TIMESTAMPTZ
);

INSERT INTO conference_sessions (session_title, session_date, start_time, planned_duration, finish_time)
VALUES 
    ('Keynote Speech', '2024-05-15', '2024-05-15 09:00:00+00', '2 hours', '2024-05-15 11:30:00+00'),
    ('Data Science Workshop', '2024-05-16', '2024-05-16 11:00:00+00', '3 hours', '2024-05-16 14:00:00+00'),
    ('AI Panel Discussion', '2024-05-17', '2024-05-17 14:00:00+00', '1.5 hours', '2024-05-17 15:20:00+00');
```

**Filtering on date/time values**

You can find all sessions scheduled for a specific date using a query like this:

```sql
SELECT session_title, start_time
FROM conference_sessions
WHERE session_date = '2024-05-16';
```

The query returns the following values:

```text
      session_title    |       start_time
-----------------------+------------------------
 Data Science Workshop | 2024-05-16 11:00:00+00
```

**Arithmetic operations with date/time**

You can write a query like this to find sessions that went over the planned duration:

```sql
SELECT session_title, planned_duration, finish_time - start_time AS actual_duration
FROM conference_sessions
WHERE finish_time - start_time > planned_duration;
``` 

The query returns the following values:

```text
 session_title  | planned_duration | actual_duration
----------------+------------------+-----------------
 Keynote Speech | 02:00:00         | 02:30:00
```

**Aggregating date/time values**

You can write a query like this to find the average duration of all sessions:

```sql
SELECT AVG(finish_time - start_time) AS avg_duration
FROM conference_sessions;
```

The query returns the following value:

```text
 avg_duration
--------------
 02:16:40
```

## Other examples

### Date and time functions

Postgres offers a variety of functions for manipulating date and time values, such as `EXTRACT`, `AGE`, `OVERLAPS`, and more.

For example, you can run this query to see if the times for any two sessions overlapped: 

```sql
SELECT 
    a.session_title AS session_a,
    b.session_title AS session_b,
    a.start_time as session_a_start,
    b.start_time as session_b_start
FROM conference_sessions a, conference_sessions b
WHERE a.session_id < b.session_id
AND (a.start_time, a.planned_duration) OVERLAPS (b.start_time, b.planned_duration);
```

This query returns no rows, indicating that there are no overlapping sessions.

### Handling time zones

Postgres supports adding time zone information to both time-of-day (`TIME WITH TIME ZONE`) and moment-in-time (`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` / `TIMESTAMPTZ`) values. 

- If you use a time zone unaware type (e.g., `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP`), Postgres ignores any time zone information provided in the input string. 
- If you use a time-zone-aware type (e.g., `TIMETZ` or `TIMESTAMPTZ`), Postgres converts the input string to UTC and stores it internally. It then displays the value in the `current time zone` set for the session. 

To illustrate this, you can create a table with both time-zone aware and unaware columns, and insert a sample row: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_example (
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    tstz_utc TIMESTAMPTZ,
    tstz_pst TIMESTAMPTZ
);

INSERT INTO time_example (ts, tstz_utc, tstz_pst)
VALUES 
    ('2024-01-01 09:00:00-08', '2024-01-01 09:00:00+00', '2024-01-01 09:00:00-08');
```

You can then check the current timezone set for the session:

```sql
SHOW timezone;
-- Returns 'GMT' (same as UTC)
```

Now, if you query the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM time_example;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
         ts          |        tstz_utc        |        tstz_pst
---------------------+------------------------+------------------------
 2024-01-01 09:00:00 | 2024-01-01 09:00:00+00 | 2024-01-01 17:00:00+00
```

Postgres ignores the timezone information for the first column and returns the second and third columns in the UTC timezone.

## Additional considerations

- **Indexing**: Date/time values often involve range queries and sorting. Indexing date/time columns can thus significantly improve query performance. 
- **Daylight Saving Time**: Working with time zones can be tricky, especially when dealing with daylight savings time. For additional details, refer to the [PostgreSQL Date/Time Types documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html).

# Character

---
title: Postgres Character Data Types
subtitle: Work with text data in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-04T14:22:44.186Z'
---

In Postgres, character data types are used to store strings. There are three primary character types: `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, and `TEXT`. `CHAR(n)` and `VARCHAR(n)` types are suitable for strings with known or limited length; for example, usernames and email addresses. Whereas `TEXT` is ideal for storing large variable-length strings, such as blog posts or product descriptions. 

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

- `VARCHAR(n)` allows storing any string up to `n` characters. 
- `CHAR(n)` stores strings in a fixed length. If a string is shorter than `n`, it is padded with spaces. 
- `TEXT` has no length limit, making it ideal for large texts. 

Storing strings requires one or a few bytes of overhead over the actual string length. `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` columns need an extra check at input time to ensure the string length is within the specified limit. Most Postgres string functions take and return `TEXT` values. 

String values are represented as literals in single quotes. For example, `'hello'` is a string literal.

## Example usage

Consider a database tracking data for a library. We have books with titles and optional descriptions. Titles are usually of a similar length, so they can be modeled with a `CHAR` type. However, descriptions can vary significantly in length, so they are assigned the `TEXT` type. 

The query below creates a `books` table and inserts some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title CHAR(50),
    description TEXT
);

INSERT INTO books (title, description)
VALUES 
    ('Postgres Guide', 'A comprehensive guide to PostgreSQL.'),
    ('Data Modeling Essentials', NULL),
    ('SQL for Professionals', 'An in-depth look at advanced SQL techniques.');
```

To find books with descriptions, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE description IS NOT NULL;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
                       title
----------------------------------------------------
 Postgres Guide
 SQL for Professionals
```

## Other examples

### String functions and operators

Postgres provides various functions and operators for manipulating character data. For instance, the `||` operator concatenates strings.

The query below joins the title and description columns together:

```sql
SELECT title || ' - ' || description AS full_description
FROM books;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
                           full_description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Postgres Guide - A comprehensive guide to PostgreSQL.

 SQL for Professionals - An in-depth look at advanced SQL techniques.
```

For more string functions and operators, see [PostgreSQL String Functions and Operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html).

### Pattern matching

With `VARCHAR` and `TEXT`, you can use pattern matching to find specific text. The `LIKE` operator is commonly used for this purpose.

```sql
SELECT id, title
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE 'Data%';
```

This returns books whose titles start with "Data". 

```text
 id |                       title
----+----------------------------------------------------
  2 | Data Modeling Essentials
```

## Additional considerations

- **Performance**: There are no significant performance differences between any of the types. Using fixed/limited length types, `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` can be useful for data validation. 
- **Function Support**: All character types support a wide range of functions and operators for string manipulation and pattern matching.

# JSON

---
title: Postgres JSON Data Types
subtitle: Modeling JSON data in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-04T13:56:31.612Z'
---

Postgres supports JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data types, providing a flexible way to store and manipulate semi-structured data. The two types are `JSON` and `JSONB`. The functions work similarly, but there are trade-offs related to data ingestion and querying performance. 

`JSON` and `JSONB` are ideal for storing data that doesn't fit neatly into a traditional relational model, since new fields can be added without altering the database schema. Additionally, they can also be used to model document-like data typically stored in NoSQL databases. 

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

### JSON

- The `JSON` data type stores `JSON` data in text format.
- It preserves an exact copy of the original `JSON` input, including whitespace and ordering of object keys.
- An advantage over storing `JSON` data in a `TEXT` column is that Postgres validates the `JSON` data at ingestion time, ensuring it is well-formed. 

### JSONB

- The `JSONB` (JSON Binary) data type stores `JSON` data in a decomposed binary format.
- Unlike `JSON`, `JSONB` does not preserve whitespace or the order of object keys. For duplicate keys, only the last value is stored. 
- `JSONB` is more efficient for querying, as it doesn't require re-parsing the `JSON` data every time it is accessed. 

`JSON` values can be created from string literals by casting. For example:

```sql
SELECT
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'::JSON as col_json,
    '[1, 2, "foo", null]'::JSONB as col_jsonb;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
           col_json           |      col_jsonb
------------------------------+---------------------
 {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} | [1, 2, "foo", null]
```

## Example usage

Consider the case of managing user profiles for a social media application. Profile data is semi-structured, with a set of fields common to all users, while other fields are optional and may vary across users. `JSONB` is a good fit for this use case. 

Using the query below, we can create a table to store user profiles:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    profile JSONB NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO user_profiles (profile)
VALUES
    ('{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "interests": ["music", "travel"], "settings": {"privacy": "public", "notifications": true, "theme": "light"}}'),
    ('{"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "interests": ["photography", "cooking"], "settings": {"privacy": "private", "notifications": false}, "city": "NYC"}'),
    ('{"name": "Charlie", "interests": ["music", "cooking"], "settings": {"privacy": "private", "notifications": true, "language": "English"}}');
```

With `JSONB`, we can directly query and manipulate elements within the `JSON` structure. For example, to find all the users interested in music, we can run the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    profile -> 'name' as name, 
    profile -> 'interests' as interests
FROM user_profiles
WHERE profile @> '{"interests":["music"]}'::JSONB;
```

The `@>` operator checks if the left `JSONB` operand contains the right `JSONB` operand as a subset. While the `->` operator extracts the value of a `JSON` key as a `JSON` value.

This query returns the following:

```text
 id |   name    |      interests
----+-----------+----------------------
  1 | "Alice"   | ["music", "travel"]
  3 | "Charlie" | ["music", "cooking"]
```

Note that the `name` values returned are still in `JSON` format. To extract the value as text, we can use the `->>` operator instead:

```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    profile ->> 'name' as name
FROM user_profiles;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
 id |  name
----+---------
  1 | Alice
  2 | Bob
  3 | Charlie
```

## JSON functions and operators

Postgres implements several functions and operators for querying and manipulating `JSON` data, including these functions described in the Neon documentation:

- [json_array_elements](/docs/functions/json_array_elements)
- [jsonb_array_elements](/docs/functions/jsonb_array_elements)
- [json_build_object](/docs/functions/json_build_object)
- [json_each](/docs/functions/json_each)
- [json_extract_path](/docs/functions/json_extract_path)
- [json_extract_path_text](/docs/functions/json_extract_path_text)
- [json_object](/docs/functions/json_object)
- [json_populate_record](/docs/functions/json_populate_record)
- [json_to_record](/docs/functions/json_to_record)

For additional `JSON` operators and functions, refer to the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)

### Nested data 

Postgres supports storing nested `JSON` values. For example, in the user profile table, the `settings` field is a `JSON` object itself. The nested values can be extracted by chaining the `->` operator. 

For example, to access the `privacy` setting for all users, you can run the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    profile -> 'name' as name, 
    profile -> 'settings' ->> 'privacy' as privacy
FROM user_profiles;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
 id |   name    | privacy
----+-----------+---------
  1 | "Alice"   | public
  2 | "Bob"     | private
  3 | "Charlie" | private
```

### Modifying JSONB data

The `JSONB` type supports updating individual fields. For example, the query below sets the `privacy` setting for all public users to `friends-only`:

```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET profile = jsonb_set(profile, '{settings, privacy}', '"friends-only"')
WHERE profile -> 'settings' ->> 'privacy' = 'public';
```

`jsonb_set` is a Postgres function that takes a `JSONB` value, a path to the field to update, and the new value. The path is specified as an array of keys.

Field updates are not supported for the `JSON` type.

### Indexing JSONB data

Postgres supports GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes for `JSONB` data, which can improve query performance significantly.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idxgin ON user_profiles USING GIN (profile);
```

This makes evaluation of `key-exists (?)` and `containment (@>)` operators efficient. For example, the query to fetch all users who have music as an interest can leverage this index. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM user_profiles
WHERE profile @> '{"interests":["music"]}';
```

## Additional considerations

### JSON vs JSONB

`JSONB` is the recommended data type for storing `JSON` data in Postgres for a few reasons.

- **Indexing**: `JSONB` allows for the creation of GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes, which makes searching within `JSONB` columns faster.
- **Performance**: `JSONB` binary format is more efficient for querying and manipulating, as it doesn't require re-parsing the `JSON` data for each access. It also supports in-place updates to individual fields.
- **Data integrity**: `JSONB` ensures that keys in an object are unique. 

There might be some legacy use cases where preserving the exact format of the `JSON` data is important. In such cases, the `JSON` data type can be used.

# Decimal

---
title: Postgres Decimal data types
subtitle: Work with exact numerical values in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-03T16:07:31.864Z'
---

In Postgres, decimal data types are used to represent numbers with arbitrarily high precision. They are crucial in financial applications and scientific computation, where exact precision is required for numerical calculations.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

Postgres provides a single decimal/numeric type referred to as `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC`. It offers user-defined precision and can represent numbers exactly up to a certain number of digits.

The syntax for defining a decimal column is `DECIMAL(precision, scale)` or `NUMERIC(precision, scale)`, where:
- `precision` is the total count of significant digits in the number (both to the left and right of the decimal point).
- `scale` is the count of decimal digits in the fractional part.

Declaring a column as `NUMERIC` without specifying precision and scale, stores numbers of any precision exactly (up to the implementation limit).

We illustrate the behavior of `NUMERIC` with the following example:

```sql
SELECT 1234.56::NUMERIC(10, 4) AS num_A,
       1234.56::NUMERIC(10, 1) AS num_B,
       1234.56789::NUMERIC AS num_C;
```

This query yields the following output:

```text
num_a     | num_b  |   num_c
----------+--------+------------
1234.5600 | 1234.6 | 1234.56789
```

The number `1234.56` is represented exactly in all three cases. However, the `NUMERIC(10, 4)` type rounds the number to 4 decimal places, while `NUMERIC(10, 1)` rounds to 1 decimal place. When no precision and scale are specified, the number is stored exactly.

## Example usage

Consider a financial application managing user portfolios. Here, `DECIMAL` is ideal for storing currency values to avoid rounding errors. For example, representing the price of a stock or the total value of a portfolio.

The following SQL creates a `portfolios` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE portfolios (
    portfolio_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    stock_symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    shares_owned DECIMAL(10, 4),
    price_per_share DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO portfolios (user_id, stock_symbol, shares_owned, price_per_share)
VALUES
    (101, 'AAPL', 150.1234, 145.67),
    (102, 'MSFT', 200.000, 214.53);
```

## Other examples

### Arithmetic operations

Postgres allows various arithmetic operations on decimal types. These operations maintain precision and are critical in contexts where rounding errors could be costly.

For example, the following query calculates the total value of each stock holding:

```sql
SELECT price_per_share * shares_owned AS total_value
FROM portfolios;
```

This query yields the following output:
```text
total_value
--------------
21868.475678
42906.000000
```

This query calculates the total value of each stock holding with precise decimal representation.

## Differences from floating-point

It's important to differentiate `DECIMAL`/`NUMERIC` from floating-point types (`REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`):

- **Precision**: `DECIMAL`/`NUMERIC` types maintain exact precision, while floating-point types are approximate and can introduce rounding errors.
- **Performance**: Operations on `DECIMAL`/`NUMERIC` types are generally slower than floating-point types due to the precision and complexity of calculations.


## Additional considerations

- **Range and Precision**: Always define `DECIMAL`/`NUMERIC` with an appropriate range and precision based on the application's requirements. Overestimating precision can lead to unnecessary storage and performance overhead.

# Floating point

---
title: Postgres Floating-point data types
subtitle: Working with float values in PostgreSQL
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-03T16:07:31.867Z'
---

In Postgres, floating point data types are used to represent numbers that might have a fractional part. These types are essential for situations where precision is key, such as scientific calculations, financial computations, and more.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

Postgres supports two primary floating-point types:

1. `REAL`: Also known as "single precision," `REAL` occupies 4 bytes of storage. It offers a precision of at least 6 decimal digits.
2. `DOUBLE PRECISION`: Known as "double precision," this type uses 8 bytes of storage and provides a precision of at least 15 decimal digits.

Both types are approximate numeric types, meaning they may have rounding errors and are not recommended for storing exact decimal values, like monetary data.

## Example usage

For a weather data application, `REAL` might be used for storing temperature readings, where extreme precision isn't critical, as in the following example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    reading_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature REAL NOT NULL,
    humidity REAL NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO weather_data (temperature, humidity)
VALUES
    (23.5, 60.2),
    (20.1, 65.3),
    (22.8, 58.1);
```

For more complex scientific calculations involving extensive decimal data, `DOUBLE PRECISION` would be more appropriate, as in this example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scientific_data (
    measurement_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    precise_temperature DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    co2_levels DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    measurement_time TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO scientific_data (precise_temperature, co2_levels, measurement_time)
VALUES
    (23.456789, 415.123456789, '2024-02-03 10:00:00'),
    (20.123456, 417.123789012, '2024-02-03 11:00:00'),
    (22.789012, 418.456123789, '2024-02-03 12:00:00');
```

## Other examples

### Arithmetic operations

Floating-point types support the standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. However, operations like division might lead to potential rounding errors and precision loss.

```sql
SELECT 10.0 / 3.0;
```

This query yields `3.3333333333333333`, which does not represent the quantity `10 / 3` exactly, but rather rounded to the nearest representable value. When performing a series of operations, these rounding errors can accumulate and lead to significant precision loss.

### Special Floating-point values

Postgres floating-point types can represent special values like `'infinity'`, `'-infinity'`, and `'NaN'` (not a number). These values can be useful in certain mathematical or scientific computations.

Consider a table named `calculations`, which might store the results of various scientific computations, including temperature changes, pressure levels, and calculation errors that could potentially result in `'infinity'`, `'-infinity'`, or `'NaN'` values:

```sql
CREATE TABLE calculations (
    calculation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature_change DOUBLE PRECISION,
    pressure_level DOUBLE PRECISION,
    error_margin DOUBLE PRECISION
);

-- Inserting special floating-point values
INSERT INTO calculations (temperature_change, pressure_level, error_margin)
VALUES
    ('infinity', 101.325, 0.001), -- An example where temperature change is beyond measurable scale
    ('-infinity', 0.0, 0.0001),   -- An example with a negative infinite value
    ('NaN', 101.325, 'NaN');      -- Examples of undefined results or unmeasurable quantities
```

Notice that you must use single quotes to wrap these values as shown above.

## Additional considerations

- **Accuracy and rounding**: Be aware of rounding errors. For applications requiring exact decimal representation (like financial calculations), consider using `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` types instead.
- **Performance**: While `DOUBLE PRECISION` offers more precision, it might not be as performant due to the larger storage size.

# Integer

---
title: Postgres Integer data types
subtitle: Work with integers in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-03T16:07:31.867Z'
---

In Postgres, integer data types are used for storing numerical values without a fractional component. They are useful as identifiers, counters, and many other common data modeling tasks. Postgres offers multiple integer types, catering to different ranges of values and storage sizes.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

Postgres supports three primary integer types. Choosing the appropriate integer type depends on the range of data expected.

1. `SMALLINT`: A small-range integer, occupying 2 bytes of storage. It's useful for columns with a small range of values.
2. `INTEGER`: The standard integer type, using 4 bytes of storage. It's the most commonly used since it balances storage/performance efficiency and range capacity.
3. `BIGINT`: A large-range integer, taking up 8 bytes. It's used when the range of `INTEGER` is insufficient.

Note that Postgres doesn't support unsigned integers. All integer types can store both positive and negative values.

## Example usage

Consider a database for a small online bookstore. Here, `SMALLINT` could be used for storing the number of copies of a book in stock, while `INTEGER` would be appropriate for a unique identifier for each book.

The query below creates a `books` table with these columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    copies_in_stock SMALLINT
);

INSERT INTO books (book_id, title, copies_in_stock)
VALUES
    (1, 'War and Peach', 50),
    (2, 'The Great Gatsby', 20),
    (3, 'The Catcher in the Rye', 100);
```

## Other examples

### Integer operations

Postgres supports various arithmetic operations on integer types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Note that the division of integers does not yield a fractional result; it truncates the result to an integer.

```sql
SELECT 10 / 4; -- Yields 2, not 2.5
```

## Sequences and auto-Increment

Postgres also provides `SERIAL`, which is a pseudo-type for creating auto-incrementing integers, often used for primary keys. It's effectively an `INTEGER` that automatically increments with each new row insertion.

There is also `BIGSERIAL` and `SMALLSERIAL` for auto-incrementing `BIGINT` and `SMALLINT` columns, respectively.

For example, we can create an `orders` table with an auto-incrementing `order_id` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_details TEXT
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_details)
VALUES ('Order 1'), ('Order 2'), ('Order 3');
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
 order_id | order_details
----------+---------------
        1 | Order 1
        2 | Order 2
        3 | Order 3
```

The `order_id` column gets a unique integer value for each new order.

## Additional considerations

- **Data integrity**: Integer types strictly store numerical values. Attempting to insert non-numeric data, or a value outside the range of that particular type will result in an error.
- **Performance**: Choosing the correct integer type (`SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`) based on the expected value range can optimize storage efficiency and performance.

# UUID

---
title: Postgres UUID data type
subtitle: Working with UUIDs in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.385Z'
---

`UUID` stands for `Universally Unique Identifier`. A `UUID` is a 128-bit value used to ensure global uniqueness across tables and databases. 

In Postgres, the UUID data type is ideal for assigning unique identifiers to entities such as users, orders, or products. They are particularly useful in distributed scenarios, where the system is spread across different databases or services, and unique keys need to be generated independently.

<CTA />

## Storage and syntax

UUIDs are stored as 128-bit values, represented as a sequence of hexadecimal digits. They are typically formatted in five groups, of sizes 8, 4, 4, 4 and 12, separated by hyphens. For example:

- `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`, or
- `a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11`

Postgres accepts UUID values in the above format, while also allowing uppercase letters and missing hyphen separators. You can also generate them using functions like `gen_random_uuid()` which is available natively in Postgres, or the `uuid_generate_v4()` function which requires the `uuid-ossp` extension. 

## Example usage

Consider a scenario where we track user sessions in a web application. UUIDs are commonly used to identify sessions due to their uniqueness. 

The query below creates a table and inserts some sample session data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id INT,
    activity TEXT
);

INSERT INTO sessions (user_id, activity)
VALUES 
    (1, 'login'),
    (2, 'view'),
    (1, 'view'),
    (1, 'logout'),
    (3, 'write')
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| session_id                             | user_id | activity |
|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| b148aab2-5a03-4d96-a119-c32fc8a4bfaa   | 1       | login    |
| 72be2042-0072-4858-b090-cb27c31e44b1   | 2       | view     |
| e817b187-aba3-4b0d-a34e-a1d82319627c   | 1       | view     |
| a940a06a-a8d4-4e90-a90c-d8fa096e620f   | 1       | logout   |
| df56fbf8-1fcd-408a-a1c6-4e18e35b8349   | 3       | write    |
```

To retrieve a specific session, we can query by its UUID:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sessions
WHERE session_id = 'e817b187-aba3-4b0d-a34e-a1d82319627c';
```

This query returns the following:

|----------------------------------------|---------|----------|

```

## Other examples

### Using UUID column as primary key

Using UUIDs as primary keys is common since the likelihood of the same UUID value being generated twice is very small. This is helpful in distributed systems or when merging data from different sources. 

For example, we can create a table to store products and use a UUID column as the primary key. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES 
    ('Apple', 1.99),
    ('Banana', 2.99),
    ('Orange', 3.99)
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| product_id                             | name   | price |
|----------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| ce3b39d8-1bae-4ed3-b4db-2a74658f0d85   | Apple  | 1.99  |
| 14c18af1-a352-45e6-976e-3c194bdc6ee8   | Banana | 2.99  |
| f303866d-d08a-48a7-81c3-c30486149d87   | Orange | 3.99  |
```

### Avoiding data leakage 

In systems where data security is a concern, using non-sequential IDs like UUIDs can help obscure the total number of records, preventing potential information leaks. This is in contrast to the sequential IDs provided by the `SERIAL` data type, which can inadvertently reveal information about the number of users, orders, etc. 

For example, the query below creates a table that tracks users of an API with some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE api_users (
    serial_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    uuid_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO api_users (username)
VALUES 
    ('user1'),
    ('user2'),
    ('user3')
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| serial_id | uuid_id                              | username |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| 1         | e5836695-f2d0-47f4-86e8-d0dbaae4031a | user1    |
| 2         | d22ec671-806a-4db2-8c60-f0f8754f9b7b | user2    |
| 3         | 108eb93a-071e-4407-8b78-a73aabd9e803 | user3    |
```

Notice that the `serial_id` column hints at the number of rows already present in the table. 

## Additional considerations

- **Randomness and uniqueness**: UUIDs are designed to be globally unique, but there's an extremely small probability of generating a duplicate UUID. If you're automatically generating UUIDs at insertion, and a duplicate UUID is generated, the insertion will fail. In the rare event that a collision occurs, applications that generate UUIDs should implement a retry mechanism.
- **Performance and indexing**: UUIDs are larger than traditional integer IDs, requiring more storage space. Index structures on UUID columns therefore consume more storage as well. However, in terms of performance for read-heavy workloads, leveraging indexed UUID columns for filtering or sorting can significantly improve query performance. In this context, you have to evaluate the tradeoff between storage efficiency and query performance.
- **Readability**: UUIDs are not human-readable, which can make debugging or manual inspection of data more challenging.

## Install an extension

Unless otherwise noted, supported extensions can be installed using [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createextension.html) syntax.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name>
```

You can install extensions from the Neon SQL Editor or from a client such as `psql` that permits running SQL queries. For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Update an extension version

Neon updates supported extensions as new versions become available. Version updates are communicated in the [Changelog](/docs/changelog). To check the current version of extensions you have installed, query the `pg_extension` table:

```bash
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

You can update an extension to the latest version using `ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO <new_version>` syntax. For example:

  ```sql
  ALTER EXTENSION postgis_topology UPDATE TO '3.3.2';
  ```

<Admonition type="important">
When Neon releases a new extension or new extension version, a compute restart is required to make the new extension or extension version available for installation or update. A compute restart may occur on its own due to Neon's default [Autosuspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) behavior. However, if your compute never restarts because you disabled Autosuspend or because your compute is constantly active, you may need to force a restart. To force a restart, users on paid plans can temporarily set a compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second (the default is 5 minutes). See [Autosuspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions. Alternatively, all Neon users can issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint temporarily interrupts any connections currently using the compute.
</Admonition>

## Extension support notes

- Neon supports the `uuid-ossp` extension for generating UUIDs instead of the `uuid` extension.
- The `sslinfo` extension is not supported. Neon handles connections via a proxy that checks SSL.
- The `pg_cron` extension is not supported. Neon scales to zero when it is not being used, which means that a scheduler that runs inside the database cannot be implemented. Consider using an scheduler that runs externally instead.
- The `file_fdw` extension is not supported. Files would not remain accessible when Neon scales to zero.

## Request extension support

To request support for a Postgres extension, paid plan users can [open a support ticket](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=support). Free plan users can submit a request via the **feedback** channel on our [Discord Server](https://neon.tech/discord).

### Custom-built extensions

On [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) and [Enterprise](/docs/introduction/plans#enterprise) plans, Neon supports custom-built Postgres extensions for exclusive use with your Neon account. If you developed your own Postgres extension and want to use it with Neon, please reach out to us as described above. Please include the following information in your request:

- A repository link or archive file containing the source code for your extension
- A description of what the extension does, instructions for compiling it, and any prerequisites
- Whether an NDA or licensing agreement is necessary for Neon to provide support for your extension

Please keep in mind that certain restrictions may apply with respect to Postgres privileges and local file system access. Additionally, Neon features such as _Autoscaling_ and _Autosuspend_ may limit the types of extensions we can support.

Depending on the nature of your extension, Neon may also request a liability waiver.

# citext

title: The citext Extension
subtitle: Use the citext extension to handle case-insensitive data in PostgreSQL
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.386Z'
---

The `citext` extension in PostgreSQL provides a case-insensitive data type for text. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the case of text data should not affect queries, such as usernames or email addresses, or any form of textual data where case-insensitivity is desired. 

<CTA />

This guide covers the `citext` extension â its setup, usage, and practical examples in PostgreSQL. For datasets where consistent text formatting isn't guaranteed, case-insensitive queries can streamline operations.

<Admonition type="note">
The `citext` extension is an open-source module for PostgreSQL. It can be easily installed and used in any PostgreSQL database. This guide provides steps for installation and usage, with further details available in the [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://postgresql.org/docs/current/citext.html).
</Admonition>

## Enable the `citext` extension

You can enable `citext` by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Example usage

**Creating a table with citext**

Consider a user registration system where the user's email should be unique, regardless of case. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    email CITEXT UNIQUE
);
```

In this table, the `email` field is of type `citext`, ensuring that email addresses are treated case-insensitively.

**Inserting data**

Insert data as you would normally. The `citext` type automatically handles case-insensitivity. 

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email)
VALUES 
  ('johnsmith', 'JohnSmith@email.com'),
  ('AliceSmith', 'ALICE@example.com'),
  ('BobJohnson', 'Bob@example.com'),
  ('EveAnderson', 'eve@example.com');
```

**Case-insensitive querying**

Queries against `citext` columns are inherently case-insensitive. Effectively, it calls the `lower()` function on both strings when comparing two values. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'johnsmith@email.com';
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| id | username   | email                  |
|----|------------|------------------------|
| 1  | johnsmith  | JohnSmith@email.com    |
```

The email address matched even though the case was different. 

## More examples

**Using citext with regex functions**

The `citext` extension can be used with regular expressions and other string-matching functions, which perform string matching in a case-insensitive manner. 

For example, the query below finds users whose email addresses start with 'AL'.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE regexp_match(email, '^AL', 'i') IS NOT NULL;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| id | username    | email              |
|----|-------------|--------------------|
| 1  | AliceSmith  | ALICE@example.com  |
```

**Using citext data as TEXT**

If you do want case-sensitive behavior, you can cast `citext` data to `text` and use it as shown here: 

Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email::text LIKE '%EVE%';
```

This query will only return results if it finds a user with an email address containing 'EVE'.

## Benefits of Using citext

- **Query simplicity**: No need for functions like `lower()` or `upper()` to perform case-insensitive comparisons.
- **Data integrity**: Helps maintain data consistency, especially in user input scenarios.

## Performance considerations

### Indexing with citext

Indexing `citext` fields is similar to indexing regular text fields. However, it's important to note that the index will be case-insensitive. 

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users USING btree(email);
```

This index will improve the performance of queries involving the `email` field. Depending on whether the more frequent use case is case-sensitive or case-insensitive, you can choose to index the `citext` field or cast it to `text` and index that. 

### Comparison with `lower()` function

`Citext` internally does an operation similar to `lower()` on both sides of the comparison, so there is not a big performance jump. However, using `citext` ensures consistent case-insensitive behavior across queries without the need for repeatedly applying the `lower()` function, which makes errors less likely. 

## Conclusion

The `citext` extension helps manage case-insensitivity in text data within PostgreSQL. It simplifies queries and ensures consistency in data handling. This guide provides an overview of using `citext`, including creating and querying case-insensitive fields.

# hstore

title: The hstore extension
subtitle: Manage key-value pairs in Postgres using hstore
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.387Z'
---

The `hstore` extension is a flexible way to store and manipulate sets of key-value pairs within a single Postgres value. It is particularly useful for semi-structured data or data that does not have a rigid schema. 

<CTA />

This guide covers the basics of the `hstore` extension - how to enable it, how to store and query key-value pairs, and perform operations on hstore data with examples. `hstore` is valuable in scenarios where schema-less data needs to be stored efficiently, such as in configurations, application settings, or any situation where the data structure may evolve over time. 

<Admonition type="note">
    `hstore` is an open-source extension for Postgres that can be installed on any compatible Postgres instance. Detailed installation instructions and compatibility information can be found at [PostgreSQL Extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html).
</Admonition>

**Version availability**

Please refer to the [list of all extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg-extensions) available in Neon for up-to-date information. 

Currently, Neon uses version `1.8` of the `hstore` extension for all Postgres versions.

## Enable the `hstore` extension

Enable the extension by running the following SQL statement in your Postgres client:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Example usage

**Creating a table with hstore column**

Consider a table that stores the product catalog for an electronics shop. Each product has a name and a set of attributes that describe it. The attributes for each product are not fixed and may change over time. This makes `hstore` a good choice for storing this data. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE product (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   attributes HSTORE
);
```

**Inserting data**

Inserting data into an `hstore` column is done by providing a string containing key-value pairs into the column. 

```sql
INSERT INTO product (name, attributes)
VALUES
    ('Desktop', 'brand => HP, price => 900, processor => "Intel Core i5", storage => "1TB HDD"'),
    ('Tablet', 'brand => Apple, price => 500, os => iOS, screen_size => 10.5'),
    ('Smartwatch', 'brand => Garmin, price => 250, water_resistant => true, battery_life => "7 days"'),
    ('Camera', 'brand => Nikon, price => 1200, megapixels => 24, video_resolution => "4K"'),
    ('Laptop', 'brand => Dell, price => 1200, screen_size => 15.6'),
    ('Smartphone', 'brand => Samsung, price => 800, os => Android'),
    ('Headphones', 'brand => Sony, price => 150, wireless => true, color => "Black"');
```

`hstore` stores both keys and values for each record as strings (values can be nulls). For numeric attributes like price and megapixels, they are cast to strings when inserted into the table.

**Querying `hstore` data**

`hstore` columns can be referenced as regular columns in a query. To access the attributes in an `hstore` column, we use the `->` operator. 

For example, to retrieve the name and brand for all products with price less than 1000, we can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT name, attributes->'brand' AS brand
FROM product
WHERE (attributes->'price')::INT < 1000;
```

Since the `price` attribute is stored as a string, we need to cast it to an integer before comparing it to 1000. This query returns the following:

```text
| name       | brand   |
|------------|---------|
| Desktop    | HP      |
| Tablet     | Apple   |
| Smartwatch | Garmin  |
| Smartphone | Samsung |
| Headphones | Sony    |
```

## Operators for `hstore` data

`hstore` offers a variety of operators for manipulating and querying key-value pairs. We go over some examples below.

**Check if a key exists**

The `?` operator is used to check if an `hstore` contains a specific key.

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM product
WHERE attributes ? 'os';
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name       |
|----|------------|
| 2  | Tablet     |
| 6  | Smartphone |
```

**Check if an hstore contains another hstore**

The `@>` operator is used to check if the `hstore` on the left contains the right operand. For example, the query below looks for products that have a `brand` attribute of `Apple`. 

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM product
WHERE attributes @> 'brand => "Apple"';
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 2  | Tablet |
```

**Concatenating two hstore values**

The `||` operator is used to concatenate two `hstore` values. For example, the query below updates the attributes for the product with name `Laptop`. 

```sql
UPDATE product
SET attributes = attributes || 'weight => 2.5'
WHERE name = 'Laptop' AND attributes -> 'brand' = 'Dell';
```

To verify, we can run the query below. 
```sql
SELECT id, name, attributes -> 'weight' AS weight
FROM product
WHERE name = 'Laptop' AND attributes -> 'brand' = 'Dell';
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name   | weight |
|----|--------|--------|
|  5 | Laptop | 2.5    |
```

**Check if a hstore contains any of the specified keys**

The `?|` operator is used to check if an `hstore` contains any of the keys specified in the right operand. For example, the query below returns all products that have either a `screen_size` or `megapixels` attribute.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM product
WHERE attributes ?| ARRAY['screen_size', 'megapixels'];
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 2  | Tablet |
| 4  | Camera |
| 5  | Laptop |
```

## `Hstore` functions

The `hstore` extension also adds functions to manipulate the `hstore` data. We go over some examples below. 

**Retrieve all keys**

The `akeys` function returns an array of all the keys in an `hstore` value. For example, the query below returns all the keys for Dell laptop products. 

```sql
SELECT id, name, akeys(attributes) AS keys
FROM product
WHERE name = 'Laptop' AND attributes -> 'brand' = 'Dell';
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name   | keys                             |
|----|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1  | Laptop | {brand,price,weight,screen_size} |
```

**Convert hstore to JSON**

The `hstore_to_json` function converts an `hstore` value to `JSON`. For example, the query below converts the `attributes` column to `JSON` for all products with a `brand` attribute of `Apple`.

```sql
SELECT hstore_to_json(attributes) AS attributes
FROM product
WHERE attributes -> 'brand' = 'Apple';
```

**Extract all keys and values**

The `each` function returns the set of key-value pairs for an `hstore` value. For example, the query below returns each attribute of the Nikon Camera as a separate row.

```sql
SELECT id, (each(attributes)).*
FROM product
WHERE name = 'Camera' AND attributes -> 'brand' = 'Nikon';
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | key              | value |
|----|------------------|-------|
| 1  | brand            | Nikon |
| 2  | price            | 1200  |
| 3  | megapixels       | 24    |
| 4  | video_resolution | 4K    |
```

## Comparing `hstore` with `JSON`

The `hstore` and `JSON` data types can be both used to store semi-structured data. `Hstore` has a flat data model â both keys and values must be strings. This makes it more efficient for simple key-value data.

In constrast, `JSON` supports a variety of data types, and can also store nested data structures. This makes it more flexible, but trades off some performance.

## Indexing and performance

Indexing can improve the performance of queries involving `hstore` data, particularly for large datasets. 

`Hstore` supports the regular `btree` and `hash` indexes. However, this is only useful for equality comparisons of the entire `hstore` value, since these indexes have no knowledge of its substructure.

```sql
CREATE INDEX btree_idx_attributes ON product USING hash (attributes);
```

For queries that involve key-level filtering, like the `@>` or the `?` operators, the `GIN` and `GIST` indexes are more useful. The indexes can be created as shown in this example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX gin_idx_attributes ON product USING gin (attributes);
```

## Conclusion

The `hstore` extension offers a powerful and flexible way to handle semi-structured data in Postgres. This guide provides an overview of using `hstore`, including creating records and querying on its attributes. It also covers some of the common operators and functions available for `hstore` data.

With each Neon project, Neon creates  a "neon" extension, which includes functions and views designed to gather Neon-specific metrics. The metrics are intended for use by the Neon team for the purpose of enhancing our service. The views are owned by a Neon system role (`cloud_admin`), but you are able to view them by connecting to the `postgres` database using `psql` and executing the command `\dv neon.*`, as shown below. At present, the extension includes two views for local file cache metrics. We may incorporate additional views in future releases.

```bash shouldWrap
psql 'postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/postgres?sslmode=require'

# neon_utils

title: The neon_utils extension
subtitle: Monitor how Neon's Autoscaling feature allocates compute resources
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.277Z'
---

The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature allocates vCPU in response to workload. The function returns the current number of allocated vCPUs.

For information about Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Install the `neon_utils` extension

Install the `neon_utils` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon_utils;
```

For information about using the Neon **SQL Editor**, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Use the `num_cpus()` function

In Neon, computing capacity is measured in _Compute Units (CU)_. One CU is 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CU is 2 vCPU and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPU. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 7 CU.

Defining a minimum and maximum compute size for your compute endpoint, as shown below, enables autoscaling.

![Edit compute endpoint dialog showing an autoscaling configuration](/docs/extensions/edit_compute_endpoint.png)

As your workload changes, computing capacity scales dynamically between the minimum and maximum settings defined in your compute endpoint configuration. To retrieve the number of allocated vCPU at any point in time, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT num_cpus();
```

For autoscaling configuration instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply:

- The `num_cpus()` function does not return fractional vCPU sizes. The _Autoscaling_ feature can scale by fractional vCPU, but the `num_cpus()` function reports the next whole number. For example, if the current number of allocated vCPU is `.25` or `.5`, the `num_cpus()` function returns `1`.
- The `num_cpus()` function only works on compute endpoints that have the _Autoscaling_ feature enabled. Running the function on a fixed size compute endpoint does not return a correct value.

## Observe autoscaling with `neon_utils` and `pgbench`

The following instructions demonstrate how you can use the `num_cpus()` function with `pgbench` to observe how Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature responds to workload.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that autoscaling is enabled for your compute endpoint. For instructions, see [Compute size and autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration). The following example uses a minimum setting of 0.25 Compute Units (CU) and a maximum of 4.
- The [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) utility.

### Run the test

1. Install the `neon_utils` extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS neon_utils;
    ```

2. Create a `test.sql` file with the following queries:

    ```sql
    SELECT LOG(factorial(5000)) / LOG(factorial(2500));
    SELECT txid_current();
    ```

3. To avoid errors when running `pgbench`, initialize your database with the tables used by `pgbench`. This can be done using the `pgbench -i` command, specifying the connection string for your Neon database. You can obtain a connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    pgbench -i postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

4. Run a `pgbench` test with your `test.sql` file, specifying your connection string:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    pgbench -f test.sql -c 15 -T 1000 -P 1 postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    The test produces output similar to the following on a compute endpoint set to scale from 0.25 to 4 CUs.

    ```bash
    pgbench (15.3)

# pgvector

---
title: The pgvector extension
subtitle: Use the pgvector for vector similarity search in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-23T19:40:04.086Z'
---

The `pgvector` extension enables you to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search in Postgres. It is particularly useful for applications involving natural language processing, such as those built on top of OpenAI's GPT models. This topic describes how to enable the `pgvector` extension in Neon and how to create, store, and query vectors.

<CTA />

## Enable the pgvector extension

You can enable the `pgvector` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Create a table to store vectors

To create a table for storing vectors, use the following SQL command, adjusting the dimensions as needed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding VECTOR(3)
);
```

The command generates a table named `items` with an `embedding` column capable of storing vectors with 3 dimensions. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model supports 1536 dimensions for each piece of text, which creates more accurate embeddings for natural language processing tasks. For more information about embeddings, see [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings), in the _OpenAI documentation_.

## Storing vectors and embeddings

After you have generated an embedding using a service like the OpenAI API, you can store the resulting vector in your database. Using a Postgres client library in your preferred programming language, you can execute an `INSERT` statement similar to the following to store embeddings:

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

This command inserts two new rows into the items table with the provided embeddings.

## Querying vectors

To retrieve vectors and calculate similarity, use `SELECT` statements and the built-in vector operators. For instance, you can find the top 5 most similar items to a given embedding using the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

This query computes the Euclidean distance (L2 distance) between the given vector and the vectors stored in the items table, sorts the results by the calculated distance, and returns the top 5 most similar items.

`pgvector` also supports inner product (`<#>`) and cosine distance (`<=>`).

For more information about querying vectors, refer to the [pgvector README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Indexing vectors

Using an index on the vector column can improve query performance with a minor cost in recall.

You can add an index for each distance function you want to use. For example, the following query adds an ivfflat index to the `embedding` column for the L2 distance function:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

This query adds an HNSW index to the `embedding` column for the L2 distance function:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

For additional indexing guidance and examples, see [Indexing](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/tree/8bf360ed84bfdeba9caa19e9f193fd9ad8dd9e73#indexing), in the _pgvector README_.

<Admonition type="note">
If you encounter an error similar to the following while attempting to create an index, you can increase the `maintenance_work_mem` setting to the required amount of memory using a `SET` or `ALTER DATABASE` statement.

```text
ERROR: memory required is 202 MB, maintenance_work_mem is 67 MB
```

The default `maintenance_work_mem` setting depends on your [compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration). The `SET` statement changes the value for the current session. `ALTER DATABASE` updates the session default.

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem TO '205MB';
```

or

```sql
ALTER DATABASE <dbname> SET maintenance_work_mem TO '205MB';
```

Always consider your compute instance's memory resources when adjusting this parameter, as setting it too high could lead to out-of-memory situations or unexpected behavior.

# pg_prewarm

title: The pg_prewarm extension
subtitle: Load data into Postgres shared buffers with the pg_prewarm extension
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-22T00:55:50.952Z'
---

You can use the `pg_prewarm` extension to preload data into the Postgres buffer cache after a restart. Doing so improves query response times by ensuring that your data is readily available in memory. Otherwise, data must be loaded into the buffer cache from disk on-demand, which can result in slower query response times.

<CTA />

In this guide, we'll explore the `pg_prewarm` extension, how to enable it, and how to use it to prewarm your Postgres buffer cache. 

<Admonition type="note">
The `pg_prewarm` extension is open-source and can be installed on any Postgres setup. Detailed information about the extension is available in the [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html).
</Admonition>

**Version availability**

Please refer to the [list of extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg-extensions) available in Neon for information about the version of `pg_prewarm` that Neon supports. 

## Enable the `pg_prewarm` extension

Enable the `pg_prewarm` extension by running the `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in your Postgres client:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_prewarm;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Basic usage

To prewarm a specific table, simply use the `pg_prewarm` function with the name of the table you want to cache.

```sql
SELECT pg_prewarm('table_name');
```

Replace `table_name` with the actual name of your table.

The output of `SELECT pg_prewarm()` is the number of blocks from the specified table that was loaded into the Postgres buffer cache. The default block size in Postgres is 8192 bytes (8KB).

The `pg_prewarm` function does not support specifying multiple table names in a single command. It's designed to work with a single table at a time. If you want to prewarm multiple tables, you would need to call `pg_prewarm` separately for each.

## Running pg_prewarm on indexes

Running `pg_prewarm` on frequently-used indexes can help improve query performance after a Postgres restart. You might also run `pg_prewarm` on indexes that are not frequently used but will be involved in upcoming heavy read operations.

Running `pg_prewarm` on an index is similar to running it on a table, but you specify the index's fully qualified name (schema name plus index name) or OID (Object Identifier) instead. 

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `pg_prewarm` to preload an index into memory:

```sql
SELECT pg_prewarm('schema_name.index_name');
```

Replace `schema_name.index_name` with the actual schema and index name you want to prewarm. If you're not sure about the index name or want to list all indexes for a specific table, you can use the `pg_indexes` view to find out. Here's how you might query for index names:

```sql
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'your_table_name';
```
Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table whose indexes you're interested in. Once you have the index name, you can then use `pg_prewarm` as shown above.

Additionally, if you prefer to use the index's OID, you can find it using the `pg_class` system catalog. Here's how to find an index's OID:

```sql
SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'index_name';
```

Then, you can use the OID with `pg_prewarm` like so:

```sql
SELECT pg_prewarm(your_index_oid);
```

## Check the proportion of a table loaded into cache

In this example, you create a table, check its data size, run `pg_prewarm`, and then check to see how much of the table's data was loaded into memory.

1. First, create a table and populate it with some data:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t_test AS
    SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000000) AS id;
    ```

2. Check the size of the table:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('t_test')) AS table_size_pretty,
        pg_relation_size('t_test') AS table_size_bytes;
    ```

    This command returns the size of the table in both MB and bytes.

    ```sql
     table_size_pretty | table_size_bytes 
    -------------------+------------------
    35 MB              |         36700160
    ```

3. Load the table data into the Postgres buffer cache using `pg_prewarm`:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_prewarm('public.t_test') AS blocks_loaded;
    ```

    This will output the number of blocks that were loaded:

    ```sql
    blocks_loaded 
    ---------------
            4480
    ```

4. To understand the calculation that follows, check the block size of your Postgres instance:

    ```sql
    SHOW block_size;
    ```

    The default block size in Postgres is 8192 bytes (8KB). We'll use this value in the next step.

    ```sql
    block_size 
    ------------
    8192
    ```

5. Calculate the total size of the data loaded into the cache using the block size and the number of blocks loaded:

    ```sql
    -- Assuming 4480 blocks were loaded (replace with your actual number from pg_prewarm output)
    SELECT 4480 * 8192 AS loaded_data_bytes;
    ```

    You can now compare this value with the size of your table.

    ```sql
     loaded_data_bytes 
    -------------------
            36700160
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
    The values for the size of the table and the size of the data loaded into the buffer cache as shown in the example above match exactly, which is an ideal scenario. However, there are cases where these values might not match, indicating that not all the data was loaded into the buffer cache; for example, this can happen if `pg_prewarm` only partially loads the table into the buffer cache due to lack of memory availability. Concurrent data modifications could also cause sizes to differ.

    To understand how much memory is available to your Postgres instance on Neon, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).
    </Admonition>  

## Demonstrating the effect of pg_prewarm

This example shows how preloading data can improve query performance. We'll create two tables with the same data, preload one table, and then run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to compare execution time results.

1. Create two sample tables with the same data for comparison:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE tbl_transactions_1
    (
        tran_id_ SERIAL,
        transaction_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
        transaction_name TEXT
    );

    INSERT INTO tbl_transactions_1
    (transaction_date, transaction_name)
    SELECT x, 'dbrnd' 
    FROM generate_series('2010-01-01 00:00:00'::timestamptz, '2018-02-01 00:00:00'::timestamptz, '1 minutes'::interval) a(x);
    ```

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE tbl_transactions_2
    (
        tran_id_ SERIAL,
        transaction_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
        transaction_name TEXT
    );

    INSERT INTO tbl_transactions_2
    (transaction_date, transaction_name)
    SELECT x, 'dbrnd' 
    FROM generate_series('2010-01-01 00:00:00'::timestamptz, '2018-02-01 00:00:00'::timestamptz, '1 minutes'::interval) a(x);
    ```

2. Restart your Postgres instance to clear the buffer cache. On Neon, you can do this by [restarting your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#restart-a-compute-endpoint).

2. Prewarm the first sample table:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_prewarm('tbl_transactions_1') AS blocks_loaded;
    ```

    This will output the number of blocks that were loaded into the cache:

    ```sql
    blocks_loaded 
    ---------------
            27805
    ```

3. Now, compare the execution plan of the prewarmed table vs. a non-prewarmed table to see the performance improvement.

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl_transactions_1;
    ```

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl_transactions_2;
    ```

    The execution time for the prewarmed table should be significantly lower than for the table that has not been prewarmed, as shown here:

    ```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl_transactions_1;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                           
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Seq Scan on tbl_transactions_1  (cost=0.00..69608.21 rows=4252321 width=18) (actual time=0.017..228.995 rows=4252321 loops=1)
    Planning Time: 1.134 ms
    Execution Time: 344.028 ms
    (3 rows)

    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl_transactions_2;
                                                            QUERY PLAN                                                            
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Seq Scan on tbl_transactions_2  (cost=0.00..69608.21 rows=4252321 width=18) (actual time=2.251..11859.232 rows=4252321 loops=1)
    Planning Time: 0.216 ms
    Execution Time: 11994.066 ms
    (3 rows)
    ```

## Conclusion

Prewarming your table data and indexes can help improve read performance, especially after a database restart or for indexes that are not frequently used but will be involved in upcoming heavy read operations. However, it's important to use this feature cautiously, especially on systems with limited memory, to avoid potential negative impacts on overall performance.

The `pg_stat_statements` extension provides a detailed statistical view of SQL statement execution within a Postgres database. It tracks information such as execution counts, total and average execution times, and more, helping database administrators and developers analyze and optimize SQL query performance.

<CTA />

This guide covers:

- [Enabling pg_stat_statements](#enable-the-pgstatstatements-extension)
- [Usage examples](#usage-examples)
- [Resetting statistics](#reset-statistics)

<Admonition type="note">
`pg_stat_statements` is an open-source extension for Postgres that can be installed on any Neon project using the instructions below.
</Admonition>

###  Version availability

The version of `pg_stat_statements` available on Neon depends on the version of Postgres you select for your Neon project.

- Postgres 14 - `pg_stat_statements` 1.9
- Postgres 15 - `pg_stat_statements` 1.10
- Postgres 16 - `pg_stat_statements` 1.10

## Enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension

You can enable the extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Usage examples

This section provides `pg_stat_statements` usage examples.

### Query the pg_stat_statements view

The main interface is the `pg_stat_statements` view, which contains one row per distinct database query, showing various statistics.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 10;
```

The view contains details like those shown below:

```
| userid | dbid  | queryid               | query                 | calls |
|--------|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| 16391  | 16384 | -9047282044438606287  | SELECT * FROM users;  | 10    |
```

For a complete list of `pg_stat_statements` columns and descriptions, see [The pg_stat_statements View](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-PG-STAT-STATEMENTS).

Let's explore some example usage patterns.

### Find the most frequently executed queries

The most frequently run queries are often critical paths and optimization candidates. 

This query retrieves details about the most frequently executed queries, ordered by the number of calls. Only the top 10 rows are returned (`LIMIT 10`):

```sql
SELECT
  userid,
  query,
  calls,
  (total_exec_time / 1000 / 60) as total_min,
  mean_exec_time as avg_ms
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Monitor slow queries

A high average runtime can indicate an inefficient query.

The query below uses the `query`, `mean_exec_time` (average execution time per call), and `calls` columns. The condition `WHERE mean_exec_time > 1` filters out queries with an average execution time greater than 1 unit (you may adjust this threshold as needed).

```sql
SELECT 
    query, 
    mean_exec_time, 
    calls
FROM 
    pg_stat_statements
WHERE 
    mean_exec_time > 1
ORDER BY 
    mean_exec_time DESC;
```

This query returns the following results:

```
| Query                                         | Mean Time | Calls |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| SELECT p.*, c.name AS category FROM products  | 250.60ms  |  723  |
```

This query retrieves the top 10 queries with the highest average execution time, focusing on queries run more than 500 times, for the current user.

```sql
WITH statements AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM pg_stat_statements pss
    JOIN pg_roles pr ON (pss.userid = pr.oid)
    WHERE pr.rolname = current_user
)
SELECT 
    calls, 
    mean_exec_time, 
    query
FROM statements
WHERE 
    calls > 500
    AND shared_blks_hit > 0
ORDER BY 
    mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query returns the 10 longest-running queries for the current user, focusing on those executed over 500 times and with some cache usage. It orders queries by frequency and cache efficiency to highlight potential areas for optimization.

```sql
WITH statements AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM pg_stat_statements pss
    JOIN pg_roles pr ON (pss.userid = pr.oid)
    WHERE pr.rolname = current_user
)
SELECT 
    calls, 
    shared_blks_hit,
    shared_blks_read,
    shared_blks_hit / (shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read)::NUMERIC * 100 AS hit_cache_ratio,
    query
FROM statements
WHERE 
    calls > 500
    AND shared_blks_hit > 0
ORDER BY 
    calls DESC, 
    hit_cache_ratio ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query retrieves the top 10 longest-running queries (in terms of mean execution time), focusing on queries executed more than 500 times, for the current user.

```sql
WITH statements AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM pg_stat_statements pss
    JOIN pg_roles pr ON (userid = oid)
    WHERE rolname = current_user
)
SELECT 
    calls, 
    min_exec_time,
    max_exec_time, 
    mean_exec_time,
    stddev_exec_time,
    (stddev_exec_time / mean_exec_time) AS coeff_of_variance,
    query
FROM statements
WHERE calls > 500
AND shared_blks_hit > 0
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
```

### Find queries that return many rows

To identify queries that return a lot of rows, you can select the `query` and `rows` columns, representing the SQL statement and the number of rows returned by each statement, respectively.

```sql
SELECT 
    query, 
    rows
FROM 
    pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY 
    rows DESC
LIMIT 
    10;
```

This query returns results similar to the following:

```
| Query                                             | Rows    |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| SELECT * FROM products;                           | 112,394 |
| SELECT * FROM users;                              | 98,723  |
| SELECT p.*, c.name AS category FROM products      | 23,984  |
```

### Find the most time-consuming queries

The following query returns details about the most time-consuming queries, ordered by execution time.


```sql
SELECT
  userid,
  query,
  calls,
  total_exec_time,
  rows
FROM
  pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY
  total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Reset statistics

When executed, the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function resets the accumulated statistical data, such as execution times and counts for SQL statements, to zero. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you want to start fresh with collecting performance statistics.

<Admonition type="note">
In Neon, only [neon_superuser](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) roles have the privilege required to execute this function. The default role created with a Neon project and roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, and API are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role.
</Admonition>

```sql
SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
```

title: The pg_tiktoken extension
subtitle: Efficiently tokenize data in your Postgres database using OpenAI's `tiktoken`
  library
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-23T19:40:04.085Z'
---

The `pg_tiktoken` extension enables fast and efficient tokenization of data in your Postgres database using OpenAI's [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library.

This topic provides guidance on installing the extension, utilizing its features for tokenization and token management, and integrating the extension with ChatGPT models.

<CTA />

## What is a token?

Language models process text in units called tokens. A token can be as short as a single character or as long as a complete word, such as "a" or "apple." In some languages, tokens may comprise less than a single character or even extend beyond a single word.

For example, consider the sentence "Neon is serverless Postgres." It can be divided into seven tokens: ["Ne", "on", "is", "server", "less", "Post", "gres"].

## `pg_tiktoken` functions

The `pg_tiktoken` offers two functions:

- `tiktoken_encode`: Accepts text inputs and returns tokenized output, allowing you to seamlessly tokenize your text data.
- `tiktoken_count`: Counts the number of tokens in a given text. This feature helps you adhere to text length limits, such as those set by OpenAI's language models.

## Install the `pg_tiktoken` extension

You can install the `pg_tiktoken` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_tiktoken
```

For information about using the Neon **SQL Editor**, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Use the `tiktoken_encode` function

The `tiktoken_encode` function tokenizes text input and returns a tokenized output. The function accepts encoding names and OpenAI model names as the first argument and the text you want to tokenize as the second argument, as shown:

```sql
SELECT tiktoken_encode('text-davinci-003', 'The universe is a vast and captivating mystery, waiting to be explored and understood.');

tiktoken_encode 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {464,6881,318,257,5909,290,3144,39438,10715,11,4953,284,307,18782,290,7247,13}
(1 row)
```

The function tokenizes text using the [Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) algorithm.

## Use the `tiktoken_count` function

The `tiktoken_count` function counts the number of tokens in a text. The function accepts encoding names and OpenAI model names as the first argument and text as the second argument, as shown:

```sql
neondb=> SELECT tiktoken_count('text-davinci-003', 'The universe is a vast and captivating mystery, waiting to be explored and understood.');

 tiktoken_count 
----------------
             17
(1 row)
```

## Supported models

The `tiktoken_count` and `tiktoken_encode` functions accept both encoding and OpenAI model names as the first argument:

```text
tiktoken_count(<encoding or model>,<text>)
```

The following models are supported:

| Encoding name      | OpenAI model                                      |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| cl100k_base        | ChatGPT models, text-embedding-ada-002            |
| p50k_base          | Code models, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003    |
| p50k_edit          | Use for edit models like text-davinci-edit-001, code-davinci-edit-001 |
| r50k_base (or gpt2)| GPT-3 models like davinci                         |

## Integrate `pg_tiktoken` with ChatGPT models

The `pg_tiktoken` extension allows you to store chat message history in a Postgres database and retrieve messages that comply with OpenAI's model limitations.

For example, consider the `message` table below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE message (
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- equals to 'system', 'user' or 'assistant'
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  n_tokens INTEGER -- number of content tokens
);
```

The [gpt-3.5-turbo chat model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction) requires specific parameters:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."}
    ]
}
```

The `messages` parameter is an array of message objects, with each object containing two pieces of information: The `role` of the message sender (either `system`, `user`, or `assistant`) and the actual message `content`. Conversations can be brief, with just one message, or span multiple pages as long as the combined message tokens do not exceed the 4096-token limit.

To insert `role`, `content`, and the number of tokens into the database, use the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO message (role, content, n_tokens)
VALUES ('user', 'Hello, how are you?', tiktoken_count('text-davinci-003','Hello, how are you?'));
```

## Manage text tokens

When a conversation contains more tokens than a model can process (e.g., over 4096 tokens for `gpt-3.5-turbo`), you will need to truncate the text to fit within the model's limit.

Additionally, lengthy conversations may result in incomplete replies. For example, if a `gpt-3.5-turbo` conversation spans 4090 tokens, the response will be limited to just six tokens.

The following query retrieves messages up to your desired token limits:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT role, content, created, n_tokens,
         SUM(tokens) OVER (ORDER BY created DESC) AS cumulative_sum
  FROM message
)

SELECT role, content, created, n_tokens, cumulative_sum
FROM cte
WHERE cumulative_sum <= <MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS>;
```

`<MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS>` represents the conversation history you want to keep for chat completion, following this formula:

```text
MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = MODEL_MAX_TOKENS â NUM_SYSTEM_TOKENS â NUM_COMPLETION_TOKENS
```

For example, assume the desired completion length is 100 tokens (`NUM_COMPLETION_TOKENS=90`).

```text
MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = 4096 â 6 â 90 = 4000
```

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", // MODEL_MAX_TOKENS = 4096
  "messages": [
         {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, // NUM_SYSTEM_TOKENS = 6
         {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
         {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
         {"role": ...}
         .
         .
         .
         {"role": "user", "content": "Great! Have a great day."}  // MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = 4000
    ] 
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `pg_tiktoken` extension is a valuable tool for tokenizing text data and managing tokens within Postgres databases. By leveraging OpenAI's tiktoken library, it simplifies the process of tokenization and working with token limits, enabling you to integrate more easily with with OpenAI's language models.

As you explore the capabilities of the `pg_tiktoken extension`, we encourage you to provide feedback and suggest features you'd like to see added in future updates. We look forward to seeing the innovative natural language processing applications you create using `pg_tiktoken`.

# pg_trgm

title: The pg_trgm extension
subtitle: Improve Postgres text searches with the pg_trgm extension
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.387Z'
---

The `pg_trgm` extension enhances Postgres' ability to perform text searches by using trigram matching. Trigrams are groups of three consecutive characters taken from a string. By breaking down text into trigrams, Postgres can perform more efficient and flexible searches, such as similarity and proximity searches. 

This extension is particularly useful for applications requiring fuzzy string matching or searching within large bodies of text.

<CTA />

In this guide, we'll explore the `pg_trgm` extension, covering how to enable it, use it for text searches, and optimize queries. This extension has applications in data retrieval, text analysis, and anywhere robust text search capabilities are needed.

<Admonition type="note">
    The `pg_trgm` extension is open-source and can be installed on any Postgres setup. Detailed information about the extension is available in the [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html).
</Admonition>

**Version availability**

Please refer to the [list of all extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg-extensions) available in Neon for up-to-date information. 

Currently, Neon uses version `1.6` of the `pg_trgm` extension for all Postgres versions.

## Enable the `pg_trgm` extension

Activate `pg_trgm` by running the `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in your Postgres client:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor). 

## Example usage

Let's say you're developing a database of books and you want to find books with similar titles. We first create a test table and insert some sample data, using the query below.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT
);

INSERT INTO books (title)
VALUES 
    ('The Great Gatsby'),
    ('The Grapes of Wrath'),
    ('Great Expectations'),
    ('War and Peace'),
    ('Pride and Prejudice'),
    ('To Kill a Mockingbird'),
    ('1984');
```

**Basic string matching**

The `pg_trgm` extension can help you do fuzzy matches on strings. 

For example, the query below looks for titles that are similar to the misspelled phrase "Grate Expectation". The `%` operator, provided by `pg_trgm`, measures similarity between two strings based on trigrams, and returns results if the similarity is above a certain threshold.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE title % 'Grate Expectation';
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| id | title               |
|----|---------------------|
| 1  | Great Expectations  |
```

The similarity threshold can be adjusted by setting the `pg_trgm.similarity_threshold` parameter (default value is `0.3`). 

## Trigrams

### Counting trigrams

The `pg_trgm` module makes these assumptions about how to count trigrams in a text string:

- Only alphanumeric characters are considered. 
- The string is lowercased before counting trigrams.
- Each word is assumed to be prefixed with two spaces and suffixed with one space. 
- The set of trigrams output is deduplicated.

We can use the `show_trgm` function to see how `pg_trgm` counts trigrams in a string. Here is an example: 

```sql
SELECT show_trgm('War and Peace'); -- {" a"," p"," w"," an"," pe"," wa",ace,and,"ar ","ce ",eac,"nd ",pea,war}
```

### Computing similarity

Given the set of trigrams for two strings `A` and `B`, `pg_trgm` computes the similarity score as the size of the intersection of the two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. 

Here is an example. 
```sql
SELECT show_trgm('War'), show_trgm('Bar'), similarity('War', 'Bar');
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| show_trgm              | show_trgm              | similarity |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| {" w"," wa","ar ",war} | {" b"," ba","ar ",bar} | 0.14285715 |
```

There are 7 distinct trigrams across the two input strings and 1 trigram in common. So the similarity score comes out to be 1/7 (0.14285715). 

## Advanced text searching

`pg_trgm` offers powerful tools for more complex text search requirements. 

**Proximity search**

The `similarity` function provided by `pg_trgm`, returns a number between 0 and 1, representing how similar the two strings are. By filtering on the similarity score, you can search for strings that are within the specified threshold. 

```sql
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE SIMILARITY(title, 'War and') > 0.3;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| title         |
|---------------|
| War and Peace |
```

**Substring matching**

`pg_trgm` also provides functionality to match the input text value against substrings within the target string. The query below illustrates this:

```sql
SELECT 
    word_similarity('apple', 'green apples'),
    strict_word_similarity('apple', 'green apples');
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| word_similarity | strict_word_similarity |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 0.8333333       | 0.625                  |
```

The `word_similarity` function returns the maximum similarity score between the input string and any substring of the target string. The similarity score is still computed using trigrams. In this example, the first string `apple` matches with the substring `apple` in the target. 

In contrast, the `strict_word_similarity` function only considers a subset of substrings from the target, namely only sequences of full words in the target string. That is, the first string `apple` matches the substring `apples` in the target, hence the lower score. 

**Distance scores**

There are operators to calculate the `distance` between two strings, i.e., one minus the similarity score. 

```sql
SELECT similarity('Hello', 'Halo') AS similarity, 'Hello' <-> 'Halo' AS distance;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| similarity | distance  |
|------------|-----------|
| 0.22222222 | 0.7777778 |
```

Similarly, there are operators to compute the distance based on the `word_similarity`  and `strict_word_similarity` functions. 

## Performance considerations

While `pg_trgm` enhances text search capabilities, computing similarity can get expensive when matching against a large set of strings. Here are a couple of tips to improve performance:

- **Indexing**: Using `pg_trgm`, you can create a `GiST` or `GIN` index to speed up similarity search queries. This also helps regular expression-based searches, such as with `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators. 
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX trgm_idx_gist ON books USING GIST (title gist_trgm_ops);
    -- or
    CREATE INDEX trgm_idx_gin ON books USING GIN (title gin_trgm_ops);
    ```

- **Limiting results**: Use `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned for more efficient querying.

## Conclusion

`pg_trgm` offers a versatile set of tools for text processing and searching in Postgres. We went over the basics of the extension, including how to enable it and how to use it for fuzzy string matching and proximity searches.

title: The postgis extension
subtitle: Work with geospatial data in Postgres using PostGIS
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-28T13:46:59.388Z'
---

The `postgis` extension provides support for spatial data - coordinates, maps and polygons, encompassing geographical and location-based information. It introduces new data types, functions, and operators to manage and analyze spatial data effectively. 

<CTA />

This guide introduces you to the `postgis` extension - how to enable it, store and query spatial data, and perform geospatial analysis with real-world examples. Geospatial data is crucial in fields like urban planning, environmental science, and logistics. 

<Admonition type="note">
    PostGIS is an open-source extension for Postgres that can be installed on any Neon Project using the instructions below. Detailed installation instructions and compatibility information can be found at [PostGIS Documentation](https://postgis.net/documentation/).
</Admonition>

**Version availability:**

Please refer to the [list of all extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg-extensions) available in Neon for up-to-date information. 

Currently, Neon uses version `3.3.3` of the `postgis` extension for all Postgres versions.

## Enable the `postgis` extension

You can enable the extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Example usage

**Create a table with spatial data**

Suppose you're managing a city's public transportation system. You can create a table to store the locations of bus stops. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE bus_stops (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    location GEOGRAPHY(Point) 
);
```

Here, the location column is of type `GEOGRAPHY(Point)`, which is a spatial data type provided by the `postgis` extension and used to store points on the Earth's surface. 

**Inserting data**

Data can be inserted into the table using regular `INSERT` statements. 

```sql
INSERT INTO bus_stops (name, location)
VALUES 
    ('Main St & 3rd Ave', ST_Point(-73.935242, 40.730610)),
    ('Elm St & 5th Ave', ST_Point(-73.991070, 40.730824));
```

The `ST_Point` function is used to create a point from the specified latitude and longitude.

**Querying spatial data**

Now, we can perform spatial queries using the built-in functions provided by `PostGIS`. For example, below we try to find points within a certain distance from a reference. 

Query:
```sql
SELECT name FROM bus_stops 
WHERE ST_DWithin(location, ST_Point(-73.95, 40.7305)::GEOGRAPHY, 2000);
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| name               |
|--------------------|
| Main St & 3rd Ave  |
```

The `ST_DWithin` function returns true if the distance between two points is less than or equal to the specified distance (when used with the `GEOGRAPHY` type, the unit is meters). 

## Spatial data types

PostGIS extends Postgres data types to handle spatial data. The primary spatial types are:

- **GEOMETRY**: A flexible type for spatial data, supporting various shapes. It models shapes in the cartesian coordinate plane. Each `GEOMETRY` value is also associated with a spatial reference system (SRS), which defines the coordinate system and units of measurement. 
- **GEOGRAPHY**: Specifically designed for large-scale spatial operations on the Earth's surface, factoring in the Earth's curvature. The coordinates for a `GEOGRAPHY` shape are specified in degrees of latitude and longitude. 

The actual shapes are stored as a set of coordinates. For example, a point is stored as a pair of coordinates, a line as a set of points, and a polygon as a set of lines. 

## Longer example

PostGIS provides a number of other functions for spatial analysis - area, distance, intersection, and more. To illustrate, we'll create dataset representing a small set of landmarks and roads in a fictional city and run spatial queries on it.

**Creating the test dataset**

```sql
CREATE TABLE landmarks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    location GEOMETRY(Point)
);

CREATE TABLE roads (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    path GEOMETRY(LineString)
);

INSERT INTO landmarks (name, location)
VALUES 
    ('Park', ST_Point(100, 200)),
    ('Museum', ST_Point(200, 300)),
    ('Library', ST_Point(300, 200));

INSERT INTO roads (name, path)
VALUES 
    ('Main Street', ST_MakeLine(ST_Point(100, 200), ST_Point(200, 300))),
    ('Second Street', ST_MakeLine(ST_Point(200, 300), ST_Point(300, 200)));
```

**Nearest landmark to a given point**

Finding the nearest places to a given point is a common spatial query. We can use the `ST_Distance` function to find the distance between two points and order the results by distance. 

```sql
SELECT name, ST_Distance(location, ST_GeomFromText('POINT(150 250)')) AS distance
FROM landmarks
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 1;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| name   | distance |
|--------|----------|
| Park   | 70.7107  |
```

**Intersection of Roads**

We can use the `ST_Intersects` function to find if two roads intersect. To ensure we don't get duplicate pairs of roads, we filter out pairs where the first road has a higher `id` than the second road.

```sql
SELECT a.name, b.name
FROM roads a AS name_A, roads b AS name_B
WHERE a.id < b.id AND ST_Intersects(a.path, b.path);
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| name_A         | name_B         |
|----------------|----------------|
| Main Street    | Second Street  |
```

**Buffer zone around a landmark**

Say, the municipal council wants to create a buffer zone of 50 units around landmarks and check which roads intersect these zones. `ST_Buffer` computes an area around the given point with the specified radius. 

```sql
SELECT l.name AS landmark, r.name AS road
FROM landmarks l, roads r
WHERE ST_Intersects(r.path, ST_Buffer(l.location, 50));
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| landmark | road          |
|----------|---------------|
| Park     | Main Street   |
| Museum   | Main Street   |
| Museum   | Second Street |
| Library  | Second Street |
```

**Line of Sight Between Landmarks**

To check if there's a direct line of sight (no roads intersecting) between two landmarks, we can combine two `postgis` functions. 

```sql
SELECT 
    'No direct line of sight' AS info
FROM 
    landmarks l1, landmarks l2, roads r
WHERE 
    l1.name = 'Park' AND l2.name = 'Library' AND 
    ST_Intersects(ST_MakeLine(l1.location, l2.location), r.path)
LIMIT 1;
```

This query returns the following:
```text
| info                     |
|--------------------------|
| No direct line of sight  |
```

This tells us there's no direct line of sight between the Park and the Library. 

## Performance considerations

When working with PostGIS, thinking about performance is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex spatial queries. 

### Indexing

**GIST** (Generalized Search Tree) is the default spatial index in PostGIS. GiST indexes are well-suited for multidimensional data, like points, lines, and polygons. It can significantly improve query performance, especially for spatial search operations and joins. 

```sql
CREATE INDEX spatial_index_name ON landmarks USING GIST(location);
```

### Query optimization

- **Unnecessary Casting**: `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` are the two primary data types in `postgis`, and a lot of functions are overloaded to work with both. However, casting between the two types can be expensive, so it's best to store data in the more frequently used type. 
- **Use Appropriate Precision**: Reducing the precision of coordinates can often improve performance without significantly impacting the results. 

## Conclusion
These examples provide a quick introduction to handling and analyzing spatial data in PostgresQL. We saw how to create tables with spatial data, insert data, and perform spatial queries using the `postgis` extension. It offers a powerful set of tools, with functions for calculating distances, identifying spatial relationships, and aggregating spatial data.

title: The timescaledb extension
subtitle: Work with time-series data in Postgres with the timescaledb extension
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-23T20:32:29.796Z'
---

`timescaledb` enables the efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data. Time-series data is a sequential collection of observations or measurements recorded over time. For example, IoT devices continuously generate data points with timestamps, representing measurements or events. `timescaledb` is designed to handle large volumes of time-stamped data and provides SQL capabilities on top of a time-oriented data model such as IoT data, sensor readings, financial market data, and other time-series datasets.

<CTA />

This guide provides an introduction to the `timescaledb` extension. Youâll learn how to enable the extension in Neon, create hypertables, run simple queries, and analyze data using `timescaledb` functions. Finally, youâll see how to delete data to free up space.

<Admonition type="note">
`timescaledb` is an open-source extension for Postgres that can be installed on any Neon Project using the instructions below.
</Admonition>

**Version availability:**

The version of `timescaledb` available on Neon depends on the version of Postgres you select for your Neon project.

- Postgres 14 - `timescaledb` 2.10.1
- Postgres 15 - `timescaledb` 2.10.1
- Postgres 16 - `timescaledb` 2.13.0

_Only [Apache-2](https://docs.timescale.com/about/latest/timescaledb-editions/) licensed features are supported. Compression is not supported._

## Enable the `timescaledb` extension

You can enable the extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Create a hypertable

`timescaledb` hypertables are a high-level abstraction, extending traditional Postgres tables to manage temporal data more effectively. A hypertable simplifies the organization and retrieval of time-series information by providing built-in partitioning based on time intervals.

To begin with, create a SQL table for temperature data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather_conditions (
 time        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
 device_id   TEXT,
 temperature  NUMERIC,
 humidity     NUMERIC
);
```

Convert it to a hypertable using the [`create_hypertable`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/create_hypertable/) function:

```sql
SELECT create_hypertable('weather_conditions', 'time');
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
|       create_hypertable         |
|---------------------------------|
| (3,public,weather_conditions,t) |
```

It is possible to use both standard SQL commands and `timescaledb` functions (which will be covered later).

To use an SQL query to insert data in the `weather_conditions` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO weather_conditions
VALUES
   (NOW(), 'weather-pro-000002', 72.0, 52.0),
   (NOW(), 'weather-pro-000003', 71.5, 51.5),
   (NOW(), 'weather-pro-000004', 73.0, 53.2);
```

To retrieve the data by time in descending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM weather_conditions ORDER BY time DESC;
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
|             time              |     device_id      | temperature | humidity |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| 2024-01-15 13:30:27.464107+00 | weather-pro-000002 |      72.0   |   52.0   |
| 2024-01-15 13:30:27.464107+00 | weather-pro-000003 |      71.5   |   51.5   |
| 2024-01-15 13:30:27.464107+00 | weather-pro-000004 |      73.0   |   53.2   |
```

## Load weather data

You can use the [sample weather dataset from TimescaleDB](https://assets.timescale.com/docs/downloads/weather_small.tar.gz) and load it into your Neon database using [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

Download the weather data:

```shell
curl https://assets.timescale.com/docs/downloads/weather_small.tar.gz -o weather_small.tar.gz

tar -xvzf weather_small.tar.gz
```

Load the data into Neon database - enter the username, password, host and database name. You can find these details in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

```shell shouldWrap
psql 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database_name>?sslmode=require' -c "\COPY weather_conditions FROM weather_small_conditions.csv CSV"
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
COPY 1000000
```

## Use hyperfunctions to analyze data

You can now start using `timescaledb` functions to analyze the data.

[**first()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/first/)

Get the first temperature reading for each location:

```sql
SELECT
device_id,
first(temperature, time) AS first_temperature
FROM weather_conditions
GROUP BY device_id
LIMIT 10;
```

The aggregate function [`first`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/first/) was used to get the earliest `temperature` value based on `time` within an aggregate group.

You should receive the following output:

```text
|     device_id      | first_temperature  |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| weather-pro-000000 |               39.9 |
| weather-pro-000001 |               32.4 |
| weather-pro-000002 |               39.8 |
| weather-pro-000003 |               36.8 |
| weather-pro-000004 |               71.8 |
| weather-pro-000005 |               71.8 |
| weather-pro-000006 |                 37 |
| weather-pro-000007 |                 72 |
| weather-pro-000008 |               31.3 |
| weather-pro-000009 |               84.4 |
```

[**last()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/last/)

Get the latest temperature reading for each location:

```sql
SELECT
device_id,
last(temperature, time) AS first_temperature
FROM weather_conditions
GROUP BY device_id
LIMIT 10;
```

The aggregate function [`last`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/last/) was used to get the latest `temperature` value based on `time` within an aggregate group.

You should receive the following output:

```text
|     device_id      | first_temperature |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| weather-pro-000000 |                42 |
| weather-pro-000001 |                42 |
| weather-pro-000002 |              72.0 |
| weather-pro-000003 |              71.5 |
| weather-pro-000004 |              73.0 |
| weather-pro-000005 | 70.3              |
| weather-pro-000006 |                42 |
| weather-pro-000007 | 69.9              |
| weather-pro-000008 |                42 |
| weather-pro-000009 |                91 |
```

[**time_bucket()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/time_bucket/)

Calculate the average temperature per hour for a specific device:

```sql
SELECT
time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS bucket_time,
AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature
FROM weather_conditions
WHERE device_id = 'weather-pro-000001'
GROUP BY bucket_time
ORDER BY bucket_time
LIMIT 10;
```

The query uses the [`time_bucket`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/time_bucket/) hyperfunction to group timestamps into one-hour intervals, calculating the average temperature for each interval from the table for a specific device, and then displays the results for the top 10 intervals.

You should receive the following output:

```text
|      bucket_time       |   avg_temperature   |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| 2016-11-15 12:00:00+00 | 32.76               |
| 2016-11-15 13:00:00+00 | 33.60               |
| 2016-11-15 14:00:00+00 | 34.83               |
| 2016-11-15 15:00:00+00 | 36.26               |
| 2016-11-15 16:00:00+00 | 37.19               |
| 2016-11-15 17:00:00+00 | 38.12               |
| 2016-11-15 18:00:00+00 | 39.02               |
| 2016-11-15 19:00:00+00 | 40.03               |
| 2016-11-15 20:00:00+00 | 40.87               |
| 2016-11-15 21:00:00+00 | 41.93               |
```

[**histogram()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/histogram/)

Bucket device humidity data:

```sql
SELECT device_id, histogram(humidity, 40, 60, 5)
FROM weather_conditions
GROUP BY device_id
LIMIT 10;
```

Here, we use the [`histogram`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/histogram/) function to create a distribution of humidity values within specified buckets (`40` to `60` with a size of `5`) for each `device_id`.

You should receive the following output:

```text
|     device_id      |      histogram      |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| weather-pro-000000 | {0,0,0,710,290,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000001 | {0,0,0,805,186,9,0} |
| weather-pro-000002 | {0,0,0,217,784,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000003 | {0,0,0,510,491,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000004 | {0,0,0,1000,1,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000005 | {0,0,0,1000,0,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000006 | {0,0,0,999,1,0,0}  |
| weather-pro-000007 | {0,0,0,1000,0,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000008 | {0,0,0,834,166,0,0} |
| weather-pro-000009 | {0,0,0,0,0,0,1000} |
```

[**approximate_row_count()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/approximate_row_count/)

Use the [`approximate_row_count`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/approximate_row_count/) function to get the approximate number of rows in `weather_conditions` hypertable:

```sql
SELECT approximate_row_count('weather_conditions');
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
| approximate_row_count |
|-----------------------|
|             1000000   |
```

## Working with chunks

Chunks are fundamental storage units within hypertables. Instead of storing the entire time-series dataset as a single monolithic table, `timescaledb` breaks it down into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk represents a distinct time interval, making data retrieval and maintenance more efficient.

[**show_chunks()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/show_chunks/)

The [`show_chunks`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/show_chunks/) function can be used to understand the underlying structure and organization of your time-series data and provides insights into how your hypertable is partitioned.

```sql
SELECT show_chunks('weather_conditions');
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
|               show_chunks               |
|-----------------------------------------|
| _timescaledb_internal._hyper_7_24_chunk |
| _timescaledb_internal._hyper_7_25_chunk |
```

`show_chunks` output indicates the presence of two internal chunks within your hypertable. To show detailed chunks information:

```sql
SELECT * FROM chunks_detailed_size('weather_conditions') ORDER BY chunk_name;
```

You should receive the following output:

```text
|     chunk_schema      |    chunk_name     | table_bytes | index_bytes | toast_bytes | total_bytes | node_name |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| _timescaledb_internal | _hyper_7_24_chunk |        8192 |       16384 |        8192 |       32768 |           |
| _timescaledb_internal | _hyper_7_25_chunk |    82190336 |     8249344 |        8192 |    90447872 |           |
```

[**drop_chunks()**](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/drop_chunks/)

You can use the [`drop_chunks`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/drop_chunks/) function to remove data chunks whose time range falls completely before (or after) a specified time.

```sql
SELECT drop_chunks('temperature_data', INTERVAL '1 days');
```

It returns a list of the chunks that were dropped.

You should receive the following output:

```text
|               drop_chunks               |
|-----------------------------------------|
| _timescaledb_internal._hyper_4_19_chunk |
| _timescaledb_internal._hyper_4_20_chunk |
```

## Data deletion

You may run into space concerns as data accumulates in timescaledb hypertables. While Neon's Postgres service does not support compression, deleting old data is an option if you don't need to hold on to it for long periods of time.

You can use the [`drop_chunks`](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/drop_chunks/#:~:text=drop_chunks(),always%20before%20the%20end%20time.) function outlined above to easily delete outdated chunks from a hypertable. For example, to delete all chunks older than 3 months:

```sql
SELECT drop_chunks('temperature_data', INTERVAL '3 months');
```

The query deletes any chunks that contain only data older than 3 months.

To automatically run this deletion periodically, you can setup a cron task. For example, adding this line to the crontab will run the deletion query every day at 1AM:

```sql
0 1 * * * psql -c "SELECT drop_chunks('temperature_data', INTERVAL '3 months')"
```

<Admonition type="note">
Please be aware that Neon's [Autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide) feature may affect the running of scheduled jobs. It may be necessary to start the compute before running a job.
</Admonition>

This will help ensure the hypertable size is managed by deleting old unneeded data. Tune the interval passed to drop_chunks and the cron schedule based on your data retention needs.

## Conclusion

You were able to configure the timescaledb extension in Neon and create a hypertable to store `weather` data. Then you executed simple queries and analyzed data using a combination of standard SQL and `timescaledb` functions before finally using `drop_chunks()` to delete data.

You can use the `array_to_json` function to convert a Postgres array into its `JSON` representation, transforming an array of values into a `JSON` array. This helps facilitate integration with web services, APIs, and web frameworks that heavily rely on `JSON`.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
array_to_json(anyarray [, pretty_bool])
```

Line feeds will be added between dimension 1 elements if `pretty_bool` is true.

## `array_to_json` example

Let's consider a scenario where an e-commerce platform stores customer preferences as an array of string values in a `customers` table.

**customers**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT NOT NULL,
 preferences TEXT[]
);

INSERT INTO customers (name, preferences)
VALUES ('John Doe', '{clothing, electronics}');

INSERT INTO customers (name, preferences)
VALUES ('Jane Doe', '{books, music, travel}');
```

```
 id  |   name   |      preferences       
----+----------+------------------------
  1 | John Doe | {clothing,electronics}
  2 | Jane Doe | {books,music,travel}
```

You can use the `array_to_json` function as shown to transform the array of string values into a `JSON` array:

```sql
SELECT id, name, array_to_json(preferences) AS json_preferences
FROM customers;
```

This query returns the following result:

```
 id  |   name   |      json_preferences      
----+----------+----------------------------
  1 | John Doe | ["clothing","electronics"]
  2 | Jane Doe | ["books","music","travel"]
```

## Advanced examples

Let's now take a look at a few advanced examples.

### Use `array_to_json` with `array_agg`

Imagine you have an e-commerce website with user's shopping cart items, as shown in the following `cart_items` table:

**cart_items**

```sql
CREATE TABLE cart_items (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
 quantity INTEGER NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO cart_items (user_id, product_id, quantity)
VALUES (1, 123, 1), (1, 456, 2), (1, 789, 3);


INSERT INTO cart_items (user_id, product_id, quantity)
VALUES (2, 123, 2), (2, 456, 3), (2, 789, 4);
```

```
 id  | user_id | product_id | quantity 
----+---------+------------+----------
  1 |       1 |        123 |        1
  2 |       1 |        456 |        2
  3 |       1 |        789 |        3
  4 |       2 |        123 |        2
  5 |       2 |        456 |        3
  6 |       2 |        789 |        4
```

You can utilize `array_to_json` to create a clean and efficient `JSON` representation of the cart contents for a specific user.

In the example below, the `row_to_json` function converts each row of the result set into a `JSON` object.

The `array_agg` function is an aggregate function that aggregates multiple values into an array. It is used here to aggregate the `JSON` objects created by `row_to_json` into a `JSON` array.

```sql
SELECT array_to_json(
 array_agg(row_to_json(t))
) AS items
FROM (
     SELECT product_id, quantity FROM cart_items WHERE user_id = 1
   ) t;
```

This query returns the following result:

```shell
                                               items                                               
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [{"product_id":123,"quantity":1},{"product_id":456,"quantity":2},{"product_id":789,"quantity":3}]
```

And this is the resulting `JSON` structure:


```json
[
   {
       "product_id": 123,
       "quantity": 1
   },
   {
       "product_id": 456,
       "quantity": 2
   },
   {
       "product_id": 789,
       "quantity": 3
   }
]
```

### Handling `NULL` in `array_to_json`

The `array_to_json` function handles `NULL` values gracefully, representing them as `JSON` `null` within the resulting array.

Let's consider a `survey_responses` table representing a survey where each participant can provide multiple responses to different questions. Some participants may not answer all questions, leading to `NULL` values in the data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE survey_responses (
   participant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   participant_name VARCHAR(50),
   responses VARCHAR(50)[]
);

-- Insert sample data with NULL responses
INSERT INTO survey_responses (participant_name, responses) VALUES
   ('Participant A', ARRAY['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe']),
   ('Participant B', ARRAY['Yes', NULL, 'No']),
   ('Participant C', ARRAY[NULL, 'No', 'Yes']),
   ('Participant D', ARRAY['Yes', 'No', NULL]);
```

```
 participant_id  | participant_name |   responses    
----------------+------------------+----------------
              1 | Participant A    | {Yes,No,Maybe}
              2 | Participant B    | {Yes,NULL,No}
              3 | Participant C    | {NULL,No,Yes}
              4 | Participant D    | {Yes,No,NULL}
```

The output correctly represents `NULL` values as `JSON` `null` in the `responses_json` array.

```sql
SELECT
   participant_id,
   participant_name,
   array_to_json(COALESCE(responses, ARRAY[]::VARCHAR[])) AS responses_json
FROM
   survey_responses;
```

This query returns the following result:

```
participant_id | participant_name | responses_json    
---------------+-----------------=+---------------------
             1 | Participant A    | ["Yes","No","Maybe"]
             2 | Participant B    | ["Yes",null,"No"]
             3 | Participant C    | [null,"No","Yes"]
             4 | Participant D    | ["Yes","No",null]
```

## Additional considerations

This section outlines additional considerations when using the `array_to_json` function.

### JSON functions

In scenarios where more control over the `JSON` structure is required, consider using the `json_build_array` and `json_build_object` functions. These functions allow for a more fine-grained construction of `JSON` objects and arrays.

### Formatting `array_to_json` output with `pretty_bool`

The `pretty_bool` parameter, when set to `true`, instructs `array_to_json` to format the output with indentation and line breaks for improved readability.

Execute the earlier query with `pretty_bool` as `true`:

```sql
SELECT array_to_json(
 array_agg(row_to_json(t)), true
) AS items
FROM (
     select product_id, quantity from cart_items WHERE user_id = 1
   ) t;
```

This query returns the following result:

```
               items               
-----------------------------------
 [{"product_id":123,"quantity":1},+
  {"product_id":456,"quantity":2},+
  {"product_id":789,"quantity":3}]
```

The output displayed in `psql` might be truncated or wrap long lines for visual clarity.

title: Postgres dense_rank() function
subtitle: Returns the rank of the current row without gaps
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.245Z'
---

You can use the `dense_rank` function to assign a rank to each distinct row within a result set. It provides a non-gapped ranking of values which is particularly useful when dealing with datasets where ties need to be acknowledged without leaving gaps in the ranking sequence.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
dense_rank() OVER (
   [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
   ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

## `dense_rank` example

Letâs say we have a `student_scores` table of students along with their name and score:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_scores (
   student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   score INT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO student_scores (student_name, score) VALUES
   ('Alice', 85),
   ('Bob', 92),
   ('Charlie', 78),
   ('David', 92),
   ('Eve', 85),
   ('Frank', 78);
```

**student_scores**

```
| student_id | student_name | score |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | Alice        | 85    |
| 2          | Bob          | 92    |
| 3          | Charlie      | 78    |
| 4          | David        | 92    |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    |
| 6          | Frank        | 78    |
```

You can use `dense_rank` to assign a rank to each row in the result set:

```sql
SELECT
   student_id,
   student_name,
   score,
   dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM
   student_scores;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| student_id | student_name | score | rank |
|------------|--------------|-------|------|
| 2          | Bob          | 92    | 1    |
| 4          | David        | 92    | 1    |
| 1          | Alice        | 85    | 2    |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    | 2    |
| 3          | Charlie      | 78    | 3    |
| 6          | Frank        | 78    | 3    |
```

## Advanced examples

This section shows advanced usage examples for the `dense_rank` function. 

### `dense_rank` with `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clause

Let's modify the previous example to include a `class_id` column to represent different classes:

**student_scores_by_class**

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_scores_by_class (
   student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   score INT NOT NULL,
   class_id INT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO student_scores_by_class (student_name, score, class_id) VALUES
   ('Alice', 85, 1),
   ('Bob', 92, 1),
   ('Charlie', 78, 1),
   ('David', 92, 2),
   ('Eve', 85, 2),
   ('Frank', 78, 2);
```

```
| student_id | student_name | score | class_id |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| 1          | Alice        | 85    | 1        |
| 2          | Bob          | 92    | 1        |
| 3          | Charlie      | 78    | 1        |
| 4          | David        | 92    | 2        |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    | 2        |
| 6          | Frank        | 78    | 2        |
```

The `PARTITION BY` clause below is used in conjunction with ranking function to divide the result set into partitions based on one or more columns. Within each partition, the ranking function operates independently.

```sql
SELECT
   student_id,
   student_name,
   score,
   class_id,
   dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY class_id ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank_within_class
FROM
   student_scores_by_class;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| student_id | student_name | score | class_id | rank_within_class |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 2          | Bob          | 92    | 1        | 1                 |
| 1          | Alice        | 85    | 1        | 2                 |
| 3          | Charlie      | 78    | 1        | 3                 |
| 4          | David        | 92    | 2        | 1                 |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    | 2        | 2                 |
| 6          | Frank        | 78    | 2        | 3                 |
```

This partitions the result set into two groups based on the `class_id` column, and the ranking is performed independently within each class. As a result, students are ranked within their respective classes, and the ranking starts fresh for each class.

### Filter `dense_rank` results in `WHERE` clause

To filter on `dense_rank` results in a `WHERE` clause, move the function into a common table expression (CTE).

Let's say you want to find the dense rank for the top two scores within each class:

```sql
WITH RankedScores AS (
   SELECT
       student_id,
       student_name,
       score,
       class_id,
       dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY class_id ORDER BY score DESC) AS dense_rank
   FROM
       student_scores_by_class
)
SELECT
   student_id,
   student_name,
   score,
   class_id,
   dense_rank
FROM
   RankedScores
WHERE
   dense_rank <= 2;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| student_id | student_name | score | class_id | dense_rank |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------|------------|
| 2          | Bob          | 92    | 1        | 1          |
| 1          | Alice        | 85    | 1        | 2          |
| 4          | David        | 92    | 2        | 1          |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    | 2        | 2          |
```

## Additional considerations

This section covers additional considerations for the `dense_rank` function. 

### How is `dense_rank` different from the `rank` function?

The `rank` function assigns a unique rank to each distinct row in the result set and leaves gaps in the ranking sequence when there are ties.
If two or more rows have the same values and are assigned the same rank, the next rank will be skipped.


```sql
SELECT
   student_id,
   student_name,
   score,
   rank() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM
   student_scores;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| student_id | student_name | score | rank |
|------------|--------------|-------|------|
| 2          | Bob          | 92    | 1    |
| 4          | David        | 92    | 1    |
| 1          | Alice        | 85    | 3    |
| 5          | Eve          | 85    | 3    |
| 3          | Charlie      | 78    | 5    |
| 6          | Frank        | 78    | 5    |
```

Alice and Eve, who share the second-highest score, have ranks 3 and 5, and there is a gap in the ranking sequence. When using `dense_rank`, Alice and Eve, who share the second-highest score, both have a rank of 2, and there is no gap in the ranking sequence.

### Aggregations

You can combine `dense_rank` with other functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` for aggregations.

Use with `COUNT`:

```sql
SELECT class_id, dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS student_count_rank, COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM student_scores_by_class
GROUP BY class_id;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| class_id | student_count_rank | student_count   |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
|     2     |          1          |       3       |
|     1     |          1          |       3       |
```

Use with `SUM`:

```sql
SELECT class_id, dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC) AS total_score_rank, SUM(score) AS total_score
FROM student_scores_by_class
GROUP BY class_id;
```

This query ranks the classes based on their total scores, assigning the highest rank to the class with the highest total score.

This query returns the following values:

```
| class_id | total_score_rank   | total_score |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
|     2     |         1         |     255     |
|     1     |         1         |     255     |
```

Use with `AVG`:

```sql
SELECT class_id, dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(score) DESC) AS average_score_rank, AVG(score) AS average_score
FROM student_scores_by_class
GROUP BY class_id;
```

This query ranks the classes based on their average scores, assigning the highest rank to the class with the highest average score.

This query returns the following values:

```
| class_id  | average_score_rank  |    average_score    |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
|     2     |          1          | 85.0000000000000000 |
|     1     |          1          | 85.0000000000000000 |
```

### Indexing

Creating indexes on the columns specified in the `ORDER BY` (sorting) and `PARTITION BY` (partitioning) clauses can significantly improve performance. In this case, queries on the `student_scores` table would benefit from creating indexes on `class_id` and `score` columns.

title: Postgres json_array_elements() function
subtitle: Expand a JSON array into a set of rows
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.246Z'
---

You can use `json_array_elements` function to expand a `JSON` array into a set of rows, each containing one element of the array. It is a simpler option compared to complex looping logic. It is also more efficient than executing the same operation on the application side by reducing data transfer and processing overhead.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_array_elements(json)
```

## `json_array_elements` example

Suppose you have a `developers` table with information about developers:

**developers**

```sql
CREATE TABLE developers (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT,
 skills JSON
);

INSERT INTO developers (id, name, skills) VALUES
 (1, 'Alice', '["Java", "Python", "SQL"]'),
 (2, 'Bob', '["C++", "JavaScript"]'),
 (3, 'Charlie', '["HTML", "CSS", "React"]');
```

```text
| id |  name   |          skills          
|----|---------|---------------------------
| 1  | Alice   | ["Java", "Python", "SQL"]
| 2  | Bob     | ["C++", "JavaScript"]
| 3  | Charlie | ["HTML", "CSS", "React"]
```

Now, let's say you want to extract a row for each skill from the skills `JSON` array. You can use `json_array_elements` to do that:

```sql
SELECT id, name, skill
FROM developers,
    json_array_elements(skills) AS skill;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| id |  name   |    skill     |
|----|---------|--------------|
| 1  | Alice   | "Java"       |
| 1  | Alice   | "Python"     |
| 1  | Alice   | "SQL"        |
| 2  | Bob     | "C++"        |
| 2  | Bob     | "JavaScript" |
| 3  | Charlie | "HTML"       |
| 3  | Charlie | "CSS"        |
| 3  | Charlie | "React"      |
```

## Advanced examples

This section shows advanced `json_array_elements` examples.

### `json_array_elements` with nested data

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `products` table storing information about products. The table schema and data are provided below.

**products**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT,
 details JSON
);

INSERT INTO products (id, name, details) VALUES
 (1, 'T-Shirt', '{"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]}'),
 (2, 'Hoodie', '{"sizes": ["XS", "S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Black", "Gray"]}'),
 (3, 'Dress', '{"sizes": ["S", "M", "L"], "colors": ["Pink", "Purple", "Black"]}'),
 (4, 'Jeans', '{"sizes": ["28", "30", "32", "34"], "colors": ["Blue", "Black"]}'),
 (5, 'Jacket', '{"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Black", "Brown", "Navy"]}');
```

```text
| id |  name   |                                details                                 |                             
|----|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | T-Shirt | {"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]}   | 
| 2  | Hoodie  | {"sizes": ["XS", "S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Black", "Gray"]}    |
| 3  | Dress   | {"sizes": ["S", "M", "L"], "colors": ["Pink", "Purple", "Black"]}      |
| 4  | Jeans   | {"sizes": ["28", "30", "32", "34"], "colors": ["Blue", "Black"]}       |
| 5  | Jacket  | {"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Black", "Brown", "Navy"]} |
```

The `json_array_elements` function can be used to get all the combinations of size and color for a specific product. For example:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 name,
 size,
 color
FROM products AS p,
 json_array_elements(p.details -> 'sizes') AS size,
 json_array_elements(p.details -> 'colors') AS color
WHERE name = 'T-Shirt';
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |  name   | size | color  |
|----|---------|------|--------|
| 1  | T-Shirt | "S"  | "Red"  |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "S"  | "Blue" |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "S"  | "Green"|
| 1  | T-Shirt | "M"  | "Red"  |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "M"  | "Blue" |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "M"  | "Green"|
| 1  | T-Shirt | "L"  | "Red"  |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "L"  | "Blue" |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "L"  | "Green"|
| 1  | T-Shirt | "XL" | "Red"  |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "XL" | "Blue" |
| 1  | T-Shirt | "XL" | "Green"|
```

## Filtering `json_array_elements`

You can use the `json_array_elements` function to extract the sizes from the `JSON` data and then filter the products based on a specific color (or size), as in this example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE 'Blue' IN (
    SELECT json_array_elements_text(details->'colors')
);
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |   name   |                               details                                |
|----|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | T-Shirt  | {"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]} |
|  4 | Jeans    | {"sizes": ["28", "30", "32", "34"], "colors": ["Blue", "Black"]}     |
```

## Handling `NULL` in `json_array_elements`

This example updates the table to insert another product (`Socks`) with one of the values in the `sizes` as `null`:

**products**

```sql
INSERT INTO products (id, name, details) VALUES (6, 'Socks', '{"sizes": ["S", null, "L", "XL"], "colors": ["White", "Black", "Gray"]}');
```

```text
| id |  name   |                                 details                                 |
|----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  6 | Socks   | {"sizes": ["S", null, "L", "XL"], "colors": ["White", "Black", "Gray"]} |
```

Querying for `Socks` shows how `null` values in an array are handled:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 name,
 size
FROM products AS p,
 json_array_elements(p.details -> 'sizes') AS size
WHERE name = 'Socks';
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | name  | size |
|----|-------|------|
|  6 | Socks | "S"  |
|  6 | Socks | null |
|  6 | Socks | "L"  |
|  6 | Socks | "XL" |
```

### Nested arrays in `json_array_elements`

You can also handle nested arrays with `json_array_elements`.

Consider a scenario where each product has multiple variants, and each variant has an array of sizes and an array of colors. This example uses an `elecronics_products` table, shown below.

**electronics_products**

```sql
CREATE TABLE electronics_products (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT,
 details JSON
);

INSERT INTO electronics_products (id, name, details) VALUES
 (1, 'Laptop', '{"variants": [{"model": "A", "sizes": ["13 inch", "15 inch"], "colors": ["Silver", "Black"]}, {"model": "B", "sizes": ["15 inch", "17 inch"], "colors": ["Gray", "White"]}]}'),
 (2, 'Smartphone', '{"variants": [{"model": "X", "sizes": ["5.5 inch", "6 inch"], "colors": ["Black", "Gold"]}, {"model": "Y", "sizes": ["6.2 inch", "6.7 inch"], "colors": ["Blue", "Red"]}]}');
```

```text
| id |    name    |                                                                                   details                                                                                    |
|----|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | Laptop     | {"variants": [{"model": "A", "sizes": ["13 inch", "15 inch"], "colors": ["Silver", "Black"]}, {"model": "B", "sizes": ["15 inch", "17 inch"], "colors": ["Gray", "White"]}]} |
|  2 | Smartphone | {"variants": [{"model": "X", "sizes": ["5.5 inch", "6 inch"], "colors": ["Black", "Gold"]}, {"model": "Y", "sizes": ["6.2 inch", "6.7 inch"], "colors": ["Blue", "Red"]}]}   |
```

To handle the nested arrays and extract information about each variant, you can use the `json_array_elements` function like this:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 name,
 variant->>'model' AS model,
 size,
 color
FROM
 electronics_products,
  json_array_elements(details->'variants') AS variant,
  json_array_elements_text(variant->'sizes') AS t1(size),
  json_array_elements_text(variant->'colors') AS t2(color);
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |    name    | model |   size   | color  |
|----|------------|-------|----------|--------|
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 13 inch  | Silver |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 13 inch  | Black  |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 15 inch  | Silver |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 15 inch  | Black  |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 15 inch  | Gray   |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 15 inch  | White  |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 17 inch  | Gray   |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 17 inch  | White  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 5.5 inch | Black  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 5.5 inch | Gold   |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 6 inch   | Black  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 6 inch   | Gold   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.2 inch | Blue   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.2 inch | Red    |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.7 inch | Blue   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.7 inch | Red    |
```

## Additional considerations

This section outlines additional considerations including alternative functions and `JSON` array order.

### Alternates to `json_array_elements`

- `jsonb_array_elements` - Consider this variant for performance benefits with `jsonb` data. `jsonb_array_elements` only accepts `jsonb` data, while `json_array_elements` works with both `json` and `jsonb`. It is typically faster, especially for larger arrays, due to its optimization for the binary `jsonb` format.
- `json_array_elements_text` - While `json_array_elements` returns each extracted element as a `JSON` value, `json_array_elements_text` returns each extracted element as a plain text _string_.

### Ordering `json_array_elements` output using `WITH ORDINALITY`

If the order of the elements is important, consider using the `WITH ORDINALITY` option:

```sql
SELECT
   id,
   name,
   skill,
   ordinality
FROM
   developers,
   json_array_elements(skills) WITH ORDINALITY AS t(skill, ordinality);
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |  name   |    skill     | ordinality |
|----|---------|--------------|------------|
|  1 | Alice   | "Java"       |          1 |
|  1 | Alice   | "Python"     |          2 |
|  1 | Alice   | "SQL"        |          3 |
|  2 | Bob     | "C++"        |          1 |
|  2 | Bob     | "JavaScript" |          2 |
|  3 | Charlie | "HTML"       |          1 |
|  3 | Charlie | "CSS"        |          2 |
|  3 | Charlie | "React"      |          3 |
```

The `WITH ORDINALITY` option in the query adds an `ordinality` column representing the original order of the skills in the array.

title: Postgres jsonb_array_elements() function
subtitle: Expands a JSONB array into a set of rows
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.249Z'

You can use the `jsonb_array_elements` function to expand a `JSONB` array into a set of rows, each containing one element of the array. It is a simpler option compared to complex looping logic. It is also more efficient than executing the same operation on the application side by reducing data transfer and processing overhead.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
jsonb_array_elements(json)
```

## `jsonb_array_elements` example

Suppose you have a table with information about developers:

**developers**

```sql
CREATE TABLE developers (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT,
 skills JSONB
);

INSERT INTO developers (id, name, skills) VALUES
 (1, 'Alice', '["Java", "Python", "SQL"]'),
 (2, 'Bob', '["C++", "JavaScript"]'),
 (3, 'Charlie', '["HTML", "CSS", "React"]');
```

```
| id |  name   |          skills          
|----|---------|---------------------------
| 1  | Alice   | ["Java", "Python", "SQL"]
| 2  | Bob     | ["C++", "JavaScript"]
| 3  | Charlie | ["HTML", "CSS", "React"]
```

Now, let's say you want to extract each individual skill from the skills `JSON` array. You can use `jsonb_array_elements` for that:

```sql
SELECT id, name, skill
FROM developers,
    jsonb_array_elements(skills) AS skill;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |  name   |    skill    
|----|---------|--------------
| 1  | Alice   | "Java"
| 1  | Alice   | "Python"
| 1  | Alice   | "SQL"
| 2  | Bob     | "C++"
| 2  | Bob     | "JavaScript"
| 3  | Charlie | "HTML"
| 3  | Charlie | "CSS"
| 3  | Charlie | "React"
```

## Advanced examples

This section shows advanced `jsonb_array_elements` examples.

## Filtering `jsonb_array_elements`

You can use the `jsonb_array_elements` function to extract the sizes from the `JSON` data and then filter the products based on a specific color (or size):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE 'Blue' IN (
 SELECT REPLACE(jsonb_array_elements(details->'colors')::text, '"', '')::text
);
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |   name   |                               details                                  |
|----|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | T-Shirt  | {"sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"], "colors": ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]}   |
|  4 | Jeans    | {"sizes": ["28", "30", "32", "34"], "colors": ["Blue", "Black"]}       |
```

## Handling `NULL` in `jsonb_array_elements`

This example updates the table to insert another product (`Socks`) with one of the values in the `sizes` as `null`:

**products**

```text
| id |  name   |                                 details                                 |
|----|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  6 | Socks   | {"sizes": ["S", null, "L", "XL"], "colors": ["White", "Black", "Gray"]} |
```

```sql
INSERT INTO products (id, name, details) VALUES (6, 'Socks', '{"sizes": ["S", null, "L", "XL"], "colors": ["White", "Black", "Gray"]}');
```

Querying for `Socks` shows how null values in an array are handled:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 name,
 size
FROM products AS p,
 jsonb_array_elements(p.details -> 'sizes') AS size
WHERE name = 'Socks';
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| id | name  | size |
|----|-------|------|
|  6 | Socks | "S"  |
|  6 | Socks | null |
|  6 | Socks | "L"  |
|  6 | Socks | "XL" |
```

### Ordering `json_array_elements` output using `WITH ORDINALITY`

Let's consider a scenario where you have a table named `workflow` with a `JSONB` column `steps` representing sequential steps in a workflow:

**workflow**

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   workflow_name TEXT,
   steps JSONB
);

INSERT INTO workflow (workflow_name, steps) VALUES
   ('Employee Onboarding', '{"tasks": ["Submit Resume", "Interview", "Background Check", "Offer", "Orientation"]}'),
   ('Project Development', '{"tasks": ["Requirement Analysis", "Design", "Implementation", "Testing", "Deployment"]}'),
   ('Order Processing', '{"tasks": ["Order Received", "Payment Verification", "Packing", "Shipment", "Delivery"]}');
```

```
| id |    workflow_name    |                                          steps                                          |
|----|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | Employee Onboarding | {"tasks": ["Submit Resume", "Interview", "Background Check", "Offer", "Orientation"]}   |
|  2 | Project Development | {"tasks": ["Requirement Analysis", "Design", "Implementation", "Testing", "Deployment"]}|
|  3 | Order Processing    | {"tasks": ["Order Received", "Payment Verification", "Packing", "Shipment", "Delivery"]}|
```

Each workflow consists of a series of tasks, and you want to extract and display the tasks along with their order in the workflow.

```sql
SELECT
   workflow_name,
   task.value AS task_name,
   task.ordinality AS task_order
FROM
   workflow,
   jsonb_array_elements(steps->'tasks') WITH ORDINALITY AS task;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
|    workflow_name    |       task_name        | task_order |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Employee Onboarding | "Submit Resume"        |          1 |
| Employee Onboarding | "Interview"            |          2 |
| Employee Onboarding | "Background Check"     |          3 |
| Employee Onboarding | "Offer"                |          4 |
| Employee Onboarding | "Orientation"          |          5 |
| Project Development | "Requirement Analysis" |          1 |
| Project Development | "Design"               |          2 |
| Project Development | "Implementation"       |          3 |
| Project Development | "Testing"              |          4 |
| Project Development | "Deployment"           |          5 |
| Order Processing    | "Order Received"       |          1 |
| Order Processing    | "Payment Verification" |          2 |
| Order Processing    | "Packing"              |          3 |
| Order Processing    | "Shipment"             |          4 |
| Order Processing    | "Delivery"             |          5 |
```

### Nested arrays in `jsonb_array_elements`

You can also handle nested arrays with `jsonb_array_elements`.

Consider a scenario where each product in an `electronics_products` table has multiple variants, and each variant has an array of sizes and an array of colors.

**electronics_products**

```sql
CREATE TABLE electronics_products (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT,
 details JSONB
);


INSERT INTO electronics_products (id, name, details) VALUES
 (1, 'Laptop', '{"variants": [{"model": "A", "sizes": ["13 inch", "15 inch"], "colors": ["Silver", "Black"]}, {"model": "B", "sizes": ["15 inch", "17 inch"], "colors": ["Gray", "White"]}]}'),
 (2, 'Smartphone', '{"variants": [{"model": "X", "sizes": ["5.5 inch", "6 inch"], "colors": ["Black", "Gold"]}, {"model": "Y", "sizes": ["6.2 inch", "6.7 inch"], "colors": ["Blue", "Red"]}]}');
```

```text
| id |    name    |                                                                                   details                                                                                   
|----|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  1 | Laptop     | {"variants": [{"model": "A", "sizes": ["13 inch", "15 inch"], "colors": ["Silver", "Black"]}, {"model": "B", "sizes": ["15 inch", "17 inch"], "colors": ["Gray", "White"]}]}
|  2 | Smartphone | {"variants": [{"model": "X", "sizes": ["5.5 inch", "6 inch"], "colors": ["Black", "Gold"]}, {"model": "Y", "sizes": ["6.2 inch", "6.7 inch"], "colors": ["Blue", "Red"]}]}
```

To handle the nested arrays and extract information about each variant, you can run this query using the `jsonb_array_elements` function:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 name,
 variant->>'model' AS model,
 size,
 color
FROM
 electronics_products,
  jsonb_array_elements(details->'variants') AS variant,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(variant->'sizes') AS t1(size),
  jsonb_array_elements_text(variant->'colors') AS t2(color);
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id |    name    | model |   size   | color  |
|----|------------|-------|----------|--------|
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 13 inch  | Silver |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 13 inch  | Black  |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 15 inch  | Silver |
|  1 | Laptop     | A     | 15 inch  | Black  |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 15 inch  | Gray   |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 15 inch  | White  |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 17 inch  | Gray   |
|  1 | Laptop     | B     | 17 inch  | White  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 5.5 inch | Black  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 5.5 inch | Gold   |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 6 inch   | Black  |
|  2 | Smartphone | X     | 6 inch   | Gold   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.2 inch | Blue   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.2 inch | Red    |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.7 inch | Blue   |
|  2 | Smartphone | Y     | 6.7 inch | Red    |
```

### `jsonb_array_elements` with joins

Let's assume you want to retrieve a list of users along with their roles in each organization. The data is stored in an `organizations` table and a `users` table.

**organizations**

```
| id |                           members                            |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | [{"id": 23, "role": "admin"}, {"id": 24, "role": "default"}] |
|  2 | [{"id": 23, "role": "user"}]                                 |
|  3 | [{"id": 24, "role": "admin"}, {"id": 25, "role": "default"}] |
|  4 | [{"id": 25, "role": "user"}]                                 |
```

**users**

```
| id  | name  |      email       |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| 23  | Max   | max@gmail.com    |
| 24  | Joe   | joe@gmail.com    |
| 25  | Alice | alice@gmail.com  |
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   members JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE users (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   name TEXT,
   email TEXT
);

INSERT INTO organizations (members) VALUES
   ('[{ "id": 23, "role": "admin" }, { "id": 24, "role": "default" }]'),
   ('[{ "id": 23, "role": "user" }]'),
   ('[{ "id": 24, "role": "admin" }, { "id": 25, "role": "default" }]'),
   ('[{ "id": 25, "role": "user" }]');

INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES
   (23, 'Max', 'max@gmail.com'),
   (24, 'Joe', 'joe@gmail.com'),
   (25, 'Alice', 'alice@gmail.com');
```

You can use the `jsonb_array_elements` function to extract the `members` from the `JSONB` array in the `organizations` table and then join with the `users` table.

```sql
SELECT
   o.id AS organization_id,
   u.id AS user_id,
   u.name AS user_name,
   u.email AS user_email,
   m->>'role' AS member_role
FROM
   organizations o
JOIN jsonb_array_elements(o.members) AS m ON true
JOIN users u ON m->>'id' = u.id::TEXT;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| organization_id | user_id | user_name |   user_email    | member_role |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
|               2 |      23 | Max       | max@gmail.com   | user        |
|               1 |      23 | Max       | max@gmail.com   | admin       |
|               3 |      24 | Joe       | joe@gmail.com   | admin       |
|               1 |      24 | Joe       | joe@gmail.com   | default     |
|               4 |      25 | Alice     | alice@gmail.com | user        |
|               3 |      25 | Alice     | alice@gmail.com | default     |
```

## Additional considerations

This section outlines additional considerations including alternative functions.

### Alternatives to `jsonb_array_elements`

Use `jsonb_array_elements` when you need to maintain the `JSON` structure of the elements for further `JSON`-related operations or analysis and `jsonb_array_elements_text` if you need to work with the extracted elements as plain text for string operations, text analysis, or integration with text-based functions.

If you want to create a comma-separated list of all skills for each developer in the `developers` table, `jsonb_array_elements_text` can be used along with `string_agg`.

```sql
SELECT name, string_agg(skill, ',') AS skill_list
FROM developers, jsonb_array_elements_text(skills) AS skill
GROUP BY name;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
|  name   |   skill_list    |
|---------|-----------------|
|  Alice  | Java,Python,SQL |
|   Bob   | C++,JavaScript  |
| Charlie | HTML,CSS,React  |
```

Using `jsonb_array_elements` would result in an error because it returns `JSONB` values, which cannot be directly concatenated with the string operator.


```sql
SELECT name, string_agg(skill, ',') AS skill_list
FROM developers, jsonb_array_elements(skills) AS skill
GROUP BY name;
```

**jsonb_path_query**

`jsonb_path_query` uses `JSON` Path expressions for flexible navigation and filtering within `JSONB` structures and returns a `JSONB` array containing matching elements. It supports filtering within the path expression itself, enabling complex conditions and excels at navigating and extracting elements from nested arrays and objects.

If your query involves navigating through multiple levels of nesting, complex filtering conditions, or updates to `JSONB` data, `jsonb_path_query` is often the preferred choice.

Consider a simple example â to extract the first skill of each developer in the `developers` table:

```sql
SELECT jsonb_path_query(skills, '$[0]') AS first_skill
FROM developers;
```

This query returns the following values:

```
| first_skill |
|-------------|
|   "Java"    |
|   "C++"     |
|   "HTML"    |
```

## Function signature

```sql
json_build_object ( VARIADIC "any" ) â json
```

## `json_build_object` example


Let's consider a scenario where we have a table storing information about users:

**users**

```text
| id |   name   | age |   city  
|----|----------|-----|----------
| 1  | John Doe |  30 | New York |
| 2  | Jane Doe |  25 | London   |
```

Create the `users` table and insert some data into it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT NOT NULL,
 age INTEGER,
 city TEXT
);

INSERT INTO users (name, age, city)
VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'New York'),
      ('Jane Doe', 25, 'London');
```

Use `json_build_object` to create a JSON structure with user information:

```sql
SELECT id,
 json_build_object(
   'name', name,
   'age', age,
   'city', city
 ) AS user_data
FROM users;
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| id |                       user_data                       
|----|--------------------------------------------------------
| 1  | {"name" : "John Doe", "age" : 30, "city" : "New York"}
| 2  | {"name" : "Jane Doe", "age" : 25, "city" : "London"}
```

## Advanced examples

### Nested objects with `json_build_object`

Letâs say we have a table of products with an `attributes` column containing JSON data:

**products**

```text
| id |    name    | price |            description            | category |                     attributes                    
|----|------------|-------|-----------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------
| 1  | T-Shirt    | 25.99 | A comfortable cotton T-Shirt      | Clothing | {"size": "Medium", "color": "Blue", "rating": 4.5}
| 2  | Coffee Mug | 12.99 | A ceramic mug with a funny design | Kitchen  | {"size": "Small", "color": "White", "rating": 3.8}
| 3  | Sneakers   | 49.99 | Sporty sneakers for everyday use  | Footwear | {"size": "10", "color": "Black", "rating": 4.2}
```

Create the `products` table and insert some data into it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   name TEXT NOT NULL,
   price DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL,
   description TEXT,
   category TEXT,
   attributes JSON
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price, description, category, attributes)
VALUES
   ('T-Shirt', 25.99, 'A comfortable cotton T-Shirt', 'Clothing', json_build_object(
       'color', 'Blue',
       'size', 'Medium',
       'rating', 4.5
   )),
   ('Coffee Mug', 12.99, 'A ceramic mug with a funny design', 'Kitchen', json_build_object(
       'color', 'White',
       'size', 'Small',
       'rating', 3.8
   )),
   ('Sneakers', 49.99, 'Sporty sneakers for everyday use', 'Footwear', json_build_object(
       'color', 'Black',
       'size', '10',
       'rating', 4.2
   ));
```

Use `json_build_object` to build a nested JSON object that represents the details of individual products:

```sql
SELECT
   id,
   name,
   price,
   json_build_object(
       'category', category,
       'description', description,
       'attributes', json_build_object(
           'color', attributes->>'color',
           'size', attributes->>'size'
       )
   ) AS details
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| id |    name     | price |                                                               details                                                              
|----|-------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1  | T-Shirt     | 25.99 | {"category" : "Clothing", "description" : "A comfortable cotton T-Shirt", "attributes" : {"color" : "Blue", "size" : "Medium"}}
| 2  | Coffee Mug  | 12.99 | {"category" : "Kitchen", "description" : "A ceramic mug with a funny design", "attributes" : {"color" : "White", "size" : "Large"}}
```

### Order `json_build_object` output

Combine `json_build_object` with `ORDER BY` to sort the results based on a specific attribute within the JSON structure.

For example, you can build a `JSON` structure with `json_build_object` from the contents of the above `products` table, and then order the results based on `rating`.

```sql
SELECT
   id,
   name,
   price,
   json_build_object(
       'category', category,
       'description', description,
       'attributes', json_build_object(
           'color', attributes->>'color',
           'size', attributes->>'size',
           'rating', attributes->>'rating'
       )
   ) AS details
FROM products_with_rating
ORDER BY (attributes->>'rating')::NUMERIC DESC;
```

`ORDER BY` was to order the results based on the descending order of rating.

This query returns the following results:

```text
| id |    name    | price |                                                                        details                                                                       
|----|------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1  | T-Shirt    | 25.99 | {"category" : "Clothing", "description" : "A comfortable cotton T-Shirt", "attributes" : {"color" : "Blue", "size" : "Medium", "rating" : "4.5"}}
| 3  | Sneakers   | 49.99 | {"category" : "Footwear", "description" : "Sporty sneakers for everyday use", "attributes" : {"color" : "Black", "size" : "10", "rating" : "4.2"}}
| 2  | Coffee Mug | 12.99 | {"category" : "Kitchen", "description" : "A ceramic mug with a funny design", "attributes" : {"color" : "White", "size" : "Small", "rating" : "3.8"}}
```

### Grouped `json_build_object` output

To create a `JSON` object that groups the total price for each category of products in the products table:

```sql
SELECT
   category,
   json_build_object(
       'total_price', sum(price)
   ) AS category_total_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| category |  category_total_price  
|----------|-------------------------
| Kitchen  | {"total_price" : 12.99}
| Clothing | {"total_price" : 25.99}
```

## Additional considerations

### Performance and indexing

The performance of the `json_build_object` depends on various factors including the number of key-value pairs, nested levels (deeply nested objects can be more expensive to build). Consider using `JSONB` data type with `jsonb_build_object` for better performance.

If your `JSON` objects have nested structures, indexing on specific paths within the nested data can be beneficial for targeted queries.

### Alternative functions

Depending on your requirements, you might want to consider similar functions:

- [json_object](/docs/functions/json_object) - Builds a JSON object out of a text array.
- `json_agg` - Aggregates values, as a JSON array.
- `row_to_json` - Returns a row as a JSON object.
- `json_object_agg` - Aggregates key-value pairs into a JSON object.

# json_each

---
title: Postgres json_each() function
subtitle: Expands JSON into a record per key-value pair
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.247Z'
---

The `json_each` function in Postgres is used to expand a `JSON` object into a set of key-value pairs. 

It is useful when you need to iterate over a `JSON` object's keys and values, such as when you're working with dynamic `JSON` structures where the schema is not fixed. Another important use case is performing data transformations and analytics. 

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_each(json JSON) -> SETOF record(key text, value json)
```

The function returns a set of rows, each containing a key and the corresponding value for each field in the input `JSON` object. The key is of type `text`, while the value is of type `json`.

## Example usage

Consider a `JSON` object representing a user's profile information. The `JSON` data will have multiple attributes and might look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

We can go over all the fields in the profile `JSON` object using `json_each`, and produce a row for each key-value pair.

```sql
SELECT key, value
FROM json_each('{"username": "johndoe", "age": 30, "email": "johndoe@example.com"}');
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| key      | value                 |
|----------|-----------------------|
| username | "johndoe"             |
| age      | 30                    |
| email    | "johndoe@example.com" |
```

## Advanced examples

### `json_each` custom column names

You can use `AS` to specify custom column names for the key and value columns. 

```sql
SELECT attr_name, attr_value
FROM json_each('{"username": "johndoe", "age": 30, "email": "johndoe@example.com"}')
AS user_data(attr_name, attr_value);
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| attr_name | attr_value            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| username  | "johndoe"             |
| age       | 30                    |
| email     | "johndoe@example.com" |
```

### Use `json_each` as a table or row source

Since `json_each` returns a set of rows, you can use it as a table source in a `FROM` clause. This lets us join the expanded `JSON` data in the output with other tables.

Here, we're joining each row in the `user_data` table with the output of `json_each`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_data (
    id INT,
    profile JSON
);
INSERT INTO user_data (id, profile)
VALUES
    (123, '{"username": "johndoe", "age": 30, "email": "johndoe@example.com"}'),
    (140, '{"username": "mikesmith", "age": 40, "email": "mikesmith@example.com"}');

SELECT id, key, value
FROM user_data, json_each(user_data.profile);
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| id  | key      | value                   |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|
| 123 | username | "johndoe"               |
| 123 | age      | 30                      |
| 123 | email    | "johndoe@example.com"   |
| 140 | username | "mikesmith"             |
| 140 | age      | 40                      |
| 140 | email    | "mikesmith@example.com" |
```

## Additional considerations

### Performance implications

When working with large `JSON` objects, `json_each` may lead to performance overhead, as it expands each key-value pair into a separate row.

### Alternative functions

- `json_each_text` - Similar functionality to `json_each` but returns the value as a text type instead of `JSON`. 
- `json_object_keys` - It returns only the set of keys in the `JSON` object, without the values.
- `jsonb_each` - It provides the same functionality as `json_each`, but accepts `JSONB` input instead of `JSON`.

subtitle: Expands JSONB into a record per key-value pair
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T23:28:28.687Z'
---

The `jsonb_each` function in Postgres is used to expand a `JSONB` object into a set of key-value pairs. 

It is useful when you need to iterate over a `JSONB` object's keys and values, such as when you're working with dynamic `JSONB` structures where the schema is not fixed. Another important use case is performing data transformations and analytics. 

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
jsonb_each(json JSON) -> SETOF record(key text, value json)
```

The function returns a set of rows, each containing a key and the corresponding value for each field in the input `JSONB` object. The key is of type `text`, while the value is of type `JSONB`.

## Example usage

Consider a `JSONB` object representing a user's profile information. The `JSONB` data will have multiple attributes and might look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

We can go over all the fields in the profile `JSONB` object using `jsonb_each`, and produce a row for each key-value pair.

```sql
SELECT key, value
FROM jsonb_each('{"username": "johndoe", "age": 30, "email": "johndoe@example.com"}');
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| key      | value                 |
|----------|-----------------------|
| username | "johndoe"             |
| age      | 30                    |
| email    | "johndoe@example.com" |
```

## Advanced examples

### Assign custom names to columns output by `jsonb_each`

You can use `AS` to specify custom column names for the key and value columns. 

```sql
SELECT attr_name, attr_value
FROM jsonb_each('{"username": "johndoe", "age": 30, "email": "johndoe@example.com"}')
AS user_data(attr_name, attr_value);
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| attr_name | attr_value            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| username  | "johndoe"             |
| age       | 30                    |
| email     | "johndoe@example.com" |
```

### Use `jsonb_each` output as a table or row source

Since `jsonb_each` returns a set of rows, you can use it as a table source in a `FROM` clause. This lets us join the expanded `JSONB` data in the output with other tables.

Here, we're joining each row in the `user_data` table with the output of `jsonb_each`:

    (140, '{"username": "mikesmith", "age": 40, "email": "mikesmith@example.com"}');

SELECT id, key, value
FROM user_data, jsonb_each(user_data.profile);
```

This query returns the following results:

```text
| id  | key      | value                   |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|
| 123 | username | "johndoe"               |
| 123 | age      | 30                      |
| 123 | email    | "johndoe@example.com"   |
| 140 | username | "mikesmith"             |

title: Postgres json_extract_path() function
subtitle: Extracts a JSON sub-object at the specified path
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.247Z'
---

You can use the `json_extract_path` function to extract the value at a specified path within a `JSON` document. This approach is performant compared to querying the entire `JSON` payload and processing it on the application side. It is particularly useful when dealing with nested `JSON` structures.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_extract_path(from_json JSON, VARIADIC path_elems TEXT[]) -> JSON
```

## Example usage

To illustrate the `json_extract_path` function in Postgres, let's consider a scenario where we have a table storing information about books. Each book has a `JSON` column containing details such as `title`, `author`, and publication `year`. You can create the `book` table using the SQL statements shown below.

**books**

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
 id INT,
 info JSON
);

INSERT INTO books (id, info) VALUES
 (1, '{"title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "author": "J.D. Salinger", "year": 1951}'),
 (2, '{"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "year": 1960}'),
 (3, '{"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949}');
```

```text
| id | info                                                                         |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | {"title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "author": "J.D. Salinger", "year": 1951} |
| 2  | {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "year": 1960}     |
| 3  | {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949}                   |
```

Now, let's use the `json_extract_path` function to extract the `title` and `author` of each book:

```sql
SELECT id,
      json_extract_path(info, 'title') as title,
      json_extract_path(info, 'author') as author
FROM books;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | title                    | author           |
|----|--------------------------|------------------|
| 1  | "The Catcher in the Rye" | "J.D. Salinger"  |
| 2  | "To Kill a Mockingbird"  | "Harper Lee"     |
| 3  | "1984"                   | "George Orwell"  |
```

## Advanced examples

Consider a `products` table that stores information about products in an e-commerce system. The table schema and data are outlined below.

**products**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
 id INT,
 attributes JSON
);

INSERT INTO products (id, attributes) VALUES
 (1, '{"name": "Laptop", "specs": {"brand": "Dell", "RAM": "16GB", "storage": {"type": "SSD", "capacity": "512GB"}}, "tags": ["pc"]}'),
 (2, '{"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Google", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "256GB"}}, "tags": ["android",
 "pixel"]}'),
 (3, '{"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Apple", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "128GB"}}, "tags": ["ios", "iphone"]}');
```

```text
| id     | attributes                                                                                                                                        |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | {"name": "Laptop", "specs": {"brand": "Dell", "RAM": "16GB", "storage": {"type": "SSD", "capacity": "512GB"}}, "tags": ["pc"]}                    |
| 2      | {"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Google", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "256GB"}}, "tags": ["android", "pixel"]} |
| 3      | {"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Apple", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "128GB"}}, "tags": ["ios", "iphone"]}     |
```

### Extract from nested JSON objects with `json_extract_path`

Let's use `json_extract_path` to retrieve information about the storage type and capacity for each product, demonstrating how to extract values from a nested `JSON` object.

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'type') as storage_type,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'capacity') as storage_capacity
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | storage_type | storage_capacity |
|----|--------------|------------------|
| 1  | "SSD"        | "512GB"          |
| 2  | "UFS"        | "256GB"          |
| 3  | "UFS"        | "128GB"          |
```

### Extract from array with `json_extract_path`

Now, let's use `json_extract_path` to extract information about the associated tags as well, demonstrating how to extract values from a `JSON` array.

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'type') as storage_type,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'capacity') as storage_capacity,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'tags', '0') as first_tag,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'tags', '1') as second_tag
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | storage_type | storage_capacity | first_tag | second_tag |
|----|--------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| 1  | "SSD"        | "512GB"          | "pc"      |  null      |
| 2  | "UFS"        | "256GB"          | "android" | "pixel"    |
| 3  | "UFS"        | "128GB"          | "ios"     | "iphone"   |
```

### Use `json_extract_path` in Joins

Let's say you have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, and the `employees` table has a `JSON` column named `details` that contains information about each employee's department. You want to join these tables based on the department information stored in the `JSON` column. The table schemas and data used in this example are shown below. 

**departments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
   department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   department_name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES
   ('IT'),
   ('HR'),
   ('Marketing');
```

```text
| department_id | department_name  |
|---------------|------------------|
|             1 | IT               |
|             2 | HR               |
|             3 | Marketing        |
```

**employees**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
   employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   employee_name VARCHAR(255),
   details JSON
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, details) VALUES
   ('John Doe', '{"department": "IT"}'),
   ('Jane Smith', '{"department": "HR"}'),
   ('Bob Johnson', '{"department": "Marketing"}');
```

```text
| employee_id | employee_name |           details           |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
|           1 | John Doe      | {"department": "IT"}        |
|           2 | Jane Smith    | {"department": "HR"}        |
|           3 | Bob Johnson   | {"department": "Marketing"} |
```

You can use `JOIN` with `json_extract_path` to retrieve information:

```sql
SELECT
   employees.employee_name,
   departments.department_name
FROM
   employees
JOIN
   departments ON TRIM(BOTH '"' FROM json_extract_path(employees.details, 'department')::TEXT) = departments.department_name;
```

This query returns the following values:

```test
| employee_name | department_name  |
|---------------|------------------|
| John Doe      | IT               |
| Jane Smith    | HR               |
| Bob Johnson   | Marketing        |
```

The `json_extract_path` function extracts the value of the `department` key from the `JSON` column in the `employees` table. The `JOIN` is then performed based on matching department names.

## Additional considerations

### Performance and Indexing

The `json_extract_path` function performs well when extracting data from `JSON` documents, especially compared to extracting data in application code. It allows performing the extraction directly in the database, avoiding transferring entire `JSON` documents to the application.

However, performance can degrade with highly nested `JSON` structures and very long text strings. In those cases, using the binary `JSONB` data type and the `jsonb_extract_path` function will likely offer better performance.

Indexing `JSON` documents can also significantly improve `json_extract_path` query performance when filtering data based on values extracted from `JSON`.

### Alternative functions

- [json_extract_path_text](/docs/functions/json_extract_path_text) - The regular `json_extract_path` function returns the extracted value as a `JSON` object or array, preserving its `JSON` structure, whereas the alternative `json_extract_path_text` function returns the extracted value as a plain text string, casting any `JSON` objects or arrays to their string representations.

    Use the regular `json_extract_path` function when you need to apply `JSON`-specific functions or operators to the extracted value, requiring `JSON` data types. The alternative `json_extract_path_text` function is preferable if you need to work directly with the extracted value as a string, for text processing, concatenation, or comparison.

- `jsonb_extract_path` - The `jsonb_extract_path` function works with the `jsonb` data type, which offers a binary representation of `JSON` data. This alternative function is generally faster than `json_extract_path` for most operations, as it's optimized for the binary `jsonb` format. This difference in performance is often more pronounced with larger `JSON` structures and frequent path extractions.

{/*
This example does not work. It returns empty values.
### Invalid paths

`json_extract_path` handles an invalid path by returning `NULL`, as in the following example:

```sql
SELECT
 id,
 json_extract_path(attributes, 'speks') as storage_type
FROM products;
```

The query above, which specifies an invalid path (`'speks'` instead of `'specs'`), returns `NULL` as shown:

```text
| id | storage_type |
|----|--------------|
|  1 |   (null)     |
|  2 |   (null)     |
|  3 |   (null)     |
```
*/}

title: Postgres jsonb_extract_path() function
subtitle: Extracts a JSONB sub-object at the specified path
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T12:36:51.919Z'

You can use the `jsonb_extract_path` function to extract the value at a specified path within a `JSONB` document. This approach is more performant compared to querying the entire `JSONB` payload and processing it on the application side. It is particularly useful when dealing with nested `JSONB` structures.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
jsonb_extract_path(from_json JSONB, VARIADIC path_elems TEXT[]) -> JSONB
```

## Example usage

To illustrate the `jsonb_extract_path` function in Postgres, let's consider a scenario where we have a table storing information about books. Each book has a `JSONB` column containing details such as `title`, `author`, and publication `year`. You can create the `book` table using the SQL statements shown below.

**books**

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT,
    info JSONB
);

INSERT INTO books (id, info) 
VALUES
    (1, '{"title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "author": "J.D. Salinger", "year": 1951}'),
    (2, '{"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "year": 1960}'),
    (3, '{"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949}');
```

```text
| id | info                                                                         |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | {"title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "author": "J.D. Salinger", "year": 1951} |
| 2  | {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee", "year": 1960}     |
| 3  | {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949}                   |
```

Now, let's use the `jsonb_extract_path` function to extract the `title` and `author` of each book:

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    jsonb_extract_path(info, 'title') as title,
    jsonb_extract_path(info, 'author') as author
FROM books;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | title                    | author           |
|----|--------------------------|------------------|
| 1  | "The Catcher in the Rye" | "J.D. Salinger"  |
| 2  | "To Kill a Mockingbird"  | "Harper Lee"     |
| 3  | "1984"                   | "George Orwell"  |
```

## Advanced examples

Consider a `products` table that stores information about the products in an e-commerce system. The table schema and data are outlined below.

**products**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT,
    attributes JSONB
);

INSERT INTO products (id, attributes) 
VALUES
    (1, '{"name": "Laptop", "specs": {"brand": "Dell", "RAM": "16GB", "storage": {"type": "SSD", "capacity": "512GB"}}, "tags": ["pc"]}'),
    (2, '{"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Google", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "256GB"}}, "tags": ["android",
    "pixel"]}'),
    (3, '{"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Apple", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "128GB"}}, "tags": ["ios", "iphone"]}');
```

```text
| id     | attributes                                                                                                                                        |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | {"name": "Laptop", "specs": {"brand": "Dell", "RAM": "16GB", "storage": {"type": "SSD", "capacity": "512GB"}}, "tags": ["pc"]}                    |
| 2      | {"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Google", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "256GB"}}, "tags": ["android", "pixel"]} |
| 3      | {"name": "Smartphone", "specs": {"brand": "Apple", "RAM": "8GB", "storage": {"type": "UFS", "capacity": "128GB"}}, "tags": ["ios", "iphone"]}     |
```

### Extract value from nested JSONB object with `jsonb_extract_path`

Let's use `jsonb_extract_path` to retrieve information about the storage type and capacity for each product, demonstrating how to extract values from a nested `JSONB` object.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'type') as storage_type,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'capacity') as storage_capacity
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | storage_type | storage_capacity |
|----|--------------|------------------|
| 1  | "SSD"        | "512GB"          |
| 2  | "UFS"        | "256GB"          |
| 3  | "UFS"        | "128GB"          |
```

### Extract values from JSON array with `jsonb_extract_path`

Now, let's use `jsonb_extract_path` to extract information about the associated tags as well, demonstrating how to extract values from a `JSONB` array.

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'type') as storage_type,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'specs', 'storage', 'capacity') as storage_capacity,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'tags', '0') as first_tag,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'tags', '1') as second_tag
FROM products;
```

This query returns the following values:

```text
| id | storage_type | storage_capacity | first_tag | second_tag |
|----|--------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| 1  | "SSD"        | "512GB"          | "pc"      |  null      |
| 2  | "UFS"        | "256GB"          | "android" | "pixel"    |
| 3  | "UFS"        | "128GB"          | "ios"     | "iphone"   |
```

### Joining data with values extracted using `jsonb_extract_path`

Let's say you have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, and the `employees` table has a `JSONB` column named `details` that contains information about each employee's department. You want to join these tables based on the department information stored in the `JSONB` column. 

The table schemas and data used in this example are shown below. 

**departments**

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO departments (department_name) 
VALUES
    ('IT'),
    ('HR'),
    ('Marketing');
```

```text
| department_id | department_name  |
|---------------|------------------|
|             1 | IT               |
|             2 | HR               |
|             3 | Marketing        |
```

**employees**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255),
    details JSONB
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, details) 
VALUES
    ('John Doe', '{"department": "IT"}'),
    ('Jane Smith', '{"department": "HR"}'),
    ('Bob Johnson', '{"department": "Marketing"}');
```

```text
| employee_id | employee_name |           details           |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
|           1 | John Doe      | {"department": "IT"}        |
|           2 | Jane Smith    | {"department": "HR"}        |
|           3 | Bob Johnson   | {"department": "Marketing"} |
```

You can use `JOIN` with `jsonb_extract_path` to retrieve the value to join on:

```sql
SELECT
    employees.employee_name,
    departments.department_name
FROM
    employees
JOIN
    departments ON TRIM(BOTH '"' FROM jsonb_extract_path(employees.details, 'department')::TEXT) = departments.department_name;
```

This query returns the following values:

```test
| employee_name | department_name  |
|---------------|------------------|
| John Doe      | IT               |
| Jane Smith    | HR               |
| Bob Johnson   | Marketing        |
```

The `jsonb_extract_path` function extracts the value of the `department` key from the `JSONB` column in the `employees` table. The `JOIN` is then performed based on matching department names.

### Handling invalid path inputs to `jsonb_extract_path`

`jsonb_extract_path` handles an invalid path by returning `NULL`, as in the following example:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    jsonb_extract_path(attributes, 'speks') as storage_type
FROM products;
```

The query above, which specifies an invalid path (`'speks'` instead of `'specs'`), returns `NULL` as shown:

```text
 id | storage_type
----+--------------
  1 |
  2 |
  3 |
```

## Additional considerations

### Performance and Indexing

The `jsonb_extract_path` function performs well when extracting data from `JSONB` documents, especially compared to extracting data in application code. It allows performing the extraction directly in the database, avoiding transferring entire `JSONB` documents to the application.

Indexing `JSONB` documents can also significantly improve `jsonb_extract_path` query performance when filtering data based on values extracted from `JSON`.

### Alternative functions

* [jsonb_extract_path_text](/docs/functions/jsonb_extract_path_text) - The regular `jsonb_extract_path` function returns the extracted value as a `JSONB` object or array, preserving its `JSON` structure, whereas the alternative `jsonb_extract_path_text` function returns the extracted value as a plain text string, casting any `JSONB` objects or arrays to their string representations.

    Use the regular `jsonb_extract_path` function when you need to apply `JSONB`-specific functions or operators to the extracted value, requiring `JSONB` data types.

title: Postgres json_extract_path_text() Function
subtitle: Extracts a JSON sub-object at the specified path as text
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.247Z'
---

The `json_extract_path_text` function is designed to simplify extracting text from `JSON` data in Postgres. This function is similar to `json_extract_path` â it also produces the value at the specified path from a `JSON` object but casts it to plain text before returning. This makes it more straightforward for text manipulation and comparison operations. 

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_extract_path_text(from_json json, VARIADIC path_elems text[]) -> TEXT
```

The function accepts a `JSON` object and a variadic list of elements that specify the path to the desired value.

## Example usage

Let's consider a `users` table with a `JSON` column named `profile` containing various user details.

Here's how we can create the table and insert some sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT,
    profile JSON
);

INSERT INTO users (id, profile) 
VALUES
    (1, '{"name": "Alice", "contact": {"email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "1234567890"}, "hobbies": ["reading", "cycling", "hiking"]}'),
    (2, '{"name": "Bob", "contact": {"email": "bob@example.com", "phone": "0987654321"}, "hobbies": ["gaming", "cooking"]}');
```

To extract and view the email addresses of all users, we can run the following query: 

```sql
SELECT id, json_extract_path_text(profile, 'contact', 'email') as email
FROM users;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | email              |
|----|--------------------|
| 1  | alice@example.com  |
| 2  | bob@example.com    |
```

## Advanced examples

### Use `json_extract_path_text` in Joins

Let's say we have another table, `hobbies`, that includes additional information such as difficulty level and the average cost to practice each hobby. 

We can create the `hobbies` table with some sample data with the following statements: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE hobbies (
   hobby_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   hobby_name VARCHAR(255),
   difficulty_level VARCHAR(50),
   average_cost VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO hobbies (hobby_name, difficulty_level, average_cost) 
VALUES
    ('Reading', 'Easy', 'Low'),
    ('Cycling', 'Moderate', 'Medium'),
    ('Gaming', 'Variable', 'High'),
    ('Cooking', 'Variable', 'Low');
```

The `users` table we created previously has a `JSON` column named `profile` that contains information about each user's preferred hobbies. A fun exercise could be to find if a user has any hobbies that are easy to get started with. Then we can recommend they engage with it more often. 

To fetch this list, we can run the query below. 

```sql
SELECT
  json_extract_path_text(u.profile, 'name') as user_name,
  h.hobby_name
FROM users u
JOIN hobbies h 
ON json_extract_path_text(u.profile, 'hobbies') LIKE '%' || lower(h.hobby_name) || '%'
WHERE h.difficulty_level = 'Easy';
```

We use `json_extract_path_text` to extract the list of hobbies for each user, and then check if the name of an easy hobby is present in the list. 

This query returns the following:

```text
| user_name | hobby_name |
|-----------|------------|
| Alice     | Reading    |
```

### Extracting values from JSON arrays with `json_extract_path_text`

`json_extract_path_text` can also be used to extract values from `JSON` arrays. 

For instance, to extract the first and second hobbies for everyone, we can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    json_extract_path_text(profile, 'name') as name,
    json_extract_path_text(profile, 'hobbies', '0') as first_hobby,
    json_extract_path_text(profile, 'hobbies', '1') as second_hobby
FROM users;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| name  | first_hobby | second_hobby |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Alice | reading     | cycling      |
| Bob   | gaming      | cooking      |
```

## Additional considerations

### Performance and indexing

Performance considerations for `json_extract_path_text` are similar to those for `json_extract_path`. It is efficient for extracting data but can be impacted by large `JSON` objects or complex queries. Indexing `JSON` fields can improve performance in some cases. 

### Alternative functions

- [json_extract_path](/docs/functions/json_extract_path) - This is a similar function that can extract data from a `JSON` object at the specified path. The difference is that it returns a `JSON` object, while `json_extract_path_text` always returns text. The right function to use depends on what you want to use the output data for. 
- [jsonb_extract_path_text](/docs/functions/jsonb_extract_path_text) - This is a similar function that can extract data from a `JSON` object at the specified path. It is more efficient but works only with data of the type `JSONB`.

## Advanced examples

### Use output of `jsonb_extract_path_text` in a `JOIN` clause

Let's say we have another table, `hobbies`, that includes additional information such as difficulty level and the average cost to practice each hobby. 

We can create the `hobbies` table with some sample data with the following statements: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE hobbies (

FROM users u
JOIN hobbies h 
ON jsonb_extract_path_text(u.profile, 'hobbies') LIKE '%' || lower(h.hobby_name) || '%'
WHERE h.difficulty_level = 'Easy';
```

We use `jsonb_extract_path_text` to extract the list of hobbies for each user, and then check if the name of an easy hobby is present in the list. 

This query returns the following:

```text
| user_name | hobby_name |
|-----------|------------|
| Alice     | Reading    |
```

### Extract values from JSON array with `jsonb_extract_path_text`

`jsonb_extract_path_text` can also be used to extract values from `JSONB` arrays. 

For instance, to extract the first and second hobbies for everyone, we can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    jsonb_extract_path_text(profile, 'name') as name,
    jsonb_extract_path_text(profile, 'hobbies', '0') as first_hobby,

# json_object

---
title: Postgres json_object() function
subtitle: Creates a JSON object from key-value pairs
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.248Z'
---

The `json_object` function in Postgres is used to create a `JSON` object from a set of key-value pairs. It is particularly useful when you need to generate `JSON` data dynamically from existing table data or input parameters.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_object(keys TEXT[], values TEXT[]) -> JSON
-- or --
json_object(keys_values TEXT[]) -> JSON
```

This function takes two text arrays as input: one for keys and one for values. Both arrays must have the same number of elements, as each key is paired with the corresponding value to construct the `JSON` object. 

Alternatively, you can pass a single text array containing both keys and values. In this case, alternate elements in the array are treated as keys and values, respectively. 

## Example usage

Consider a scenario where you run a library and have a table that tracks details for each book. 

The table with some sample data can be set up as shown:

```sql
-- Test database table for a bookstore inventory
CREATE TABLE book_inventory (
    book_id INT,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    price NUMERIC,
    genre TEXT
);

-- Inserting some test data into `book_inventory`
INSERT INTO book_inventory VALUES
(101, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 18.99, 'Classic'),
(102, 'Invisible Man', 'Ralph Ellison', 15.99, 'Novel');
```

When querying this dataset, the frontend client might want to present the data in a different way. Say you want the catalog information just as the list of book names while combining the rest of the fields into a single `metadata` attribute. You can do so as shown here:

```sql
SELECT book_id, title, json_object(
  ARRAY['author', 'genre'], 
  ARRAY[author, genre]
) AS metadata
FROM book_inventory;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| book_id | title            | metadata                                   |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 101     | The Great Gatsby | {"author" : "F. Scott Fitzgerald",         |
|         |                  |  "genre" : "Classic"}                      |
| 102     | Invisible Man    | {"author" : "Ralph Ellison",               |
|         |                  |  "genre" : "Novel"}                        |
```

## Advanced examples

### Creating nested JSON objects with `json_object`

You could use `json_object` to create nested `JSON` objects for representing more complex data. However, since `json_object` only expects text values for each key, we will need to combine it with other `JSON` functions like `json_build_object`. For example:

```sql
SELECT json_build_object(
  'title', title,
  'author', json_object(ARRAY['name', 'genre'], ARRAY[author, genre])
) AS book_info
FROM book_inventory;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| book_info                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {"title" : "The Great Gatsby", "author" : {"name" : "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "genre" : "Classic"}} |
| {"title" : "Invisible Man", "author" : {"name" : "Ralph Ellison", "genre" : "Novel"}}            |
```

## Additional considerations

### Gotchas and footguns

- Ensure both keys and values arrays have the same number of elements. Mismatched arrays will result in an error. Or, if passing in a single key-value array, ensure that the array has an even number of elements. 
- Be aware of data type conversions. Since `json_object` expects text arrays, you may need to explicitly cast non-text data types to text. 

### Alternative functions

- [jsonb_object](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) - Same functionality as `json_object`, but returns a `JSONB` object instead of `JSON`. 
- [row_to_json](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) - It can be used to create a `JSON` object from a table row (or a row of a  composite type) without needing to specify keys and values explicitly. Although, it is less flexible than `json_object` since all fields in the row are included in the `JSON` object. 
- [json_build_object](/docs/functions/json_build_object) - Similar to `json_object`, but allows for more flexibility in constructing the `JSON` object, as it can take a variable number of arguments in the form of key-value pairs. 
- [json_object_agg](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) - It is used to aggregate the key-value pairs from multiple rows into a single `JSON` object. In contrast, `json_object` outputs a `JSON` object for each row.

# jsonb_object

title: Postgres jsonb_object() function
subtitle: Creates a JSONB object from key-value pairs
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T23:28:28.690Z'
---

The `jsonb_object` function in Postgres is used to create a `JSONB` object from a set of key-value pairs. It is particularly useful when you need to generate `JSONB` data dynamically from existing table data or input parameters.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
jsonb_object(keys TEXT[], values TEXT[]) -> JSONB
-- or --
jsonb_object(keys_values TEXT[]) -> JSONB
```

This function takes two text arrays as input: one for keys and one for values. Both arrays must have the same number of elements, as each key is paired with the corresponding value to construct the `JSONB` object. 

Alternatively, you can pass a single text array containing both keys and values. In this case, alternate elements in the array are treated as keys and values, respectively. 

## Example usage

Consider a scenario where you run a library and have a table that tracks details for each book. 

The table with some sample data can be set up as shown:

```sql
-- Test database table for a bookstore inventory
CREATE TABLE book_inventory (
    book_id INT,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    price NUMERIC,
    genre TEXT
);

-- Inserting some test data into `book_inventory`
INSERT INTO book_inventory VALUES
(101, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 18.99, 'Classic'),
(102, 'Invisible Man', 'Ralph Ellison', 15.99, 'Novel');
```

When querying this dataset, the frontend client might want to present the data in a different way. Say you want the catalog information just as the list of book names while combining the rest of the fields into a single `metadata` attribute. You can do so as shown here:

```sql
SELECT book_id, title, jsonb_object(
  ARRAY['author', 'genre'], 
  ARRAY[author, genre]
) AS metadata
FROM book_inventory;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| book_id | title            | metadata                                   |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 101     | The Great Gatsby | {"author" : "F. Scott Fitzgerald",         |
|         |                  |  "genre" : "Classic"}                      |
| 102     | Invisible Man    | {"author" : "Ralph Ellison",               |
|         |                  |  "genre" : "Novel"}                        |

# json_populate_record

---
title: Postgres json_populate_record() function
subtitle: Casts a JSON object to a record
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.248Z'
---

The `json_populate_record` function is used to populate a record type with values from a `JSON` object. It is useful for parsing `JSON` data received from external sources, particularly when merging it into an existing record.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_populate_record(base_record ANYELEMENT, json JSON)
```

This function takes two arguments: a base record of a row type (which can even be a `NULL` record) and a `JSON` object. It returns the record updated with the `JSON` values. 

## Example usage

Consider a database table that tracks employee information. When you receive employee information as `JSON` records, you can use `json_populate_record` to ingest the data into the table. 

Here we create the `employees` table with some sample data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary NUMERIC
);
```

To illustrate, we start with a `NULL` record and cast the input `JSON` payload to the `employees` record type.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
SELECT *
FROM json_populate_record(
    NULL::employees, 
    '{"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering", "salary": "75000"}'
)
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| id | name     | department  | salary |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|
| 123| John Doe | Engineering | 75000  |
```

## Advanced examples

### Handling partial data with `json_populate_record`

For data points where the `JSON` objects have missing keys, `json_populate_record` can still cast them into legible records. 

Say we receive records for a bunch of employees who are known to be in Sales, but the `department` field is missing from the `JSON` payload. We can use `json_populate_record` with the default value specified for a field while the other fields are populated from the `JSON` payload, as in this example:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
SELECT *
FROM json_populate_record(
    (1, 'ABC', 'Sales', 0)::employees,
    '{"id": "124", "name": "Jane Smith", "salary": "68000"}'
)
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following:

```text
| id | name       | department | salary |
|----|------------|------------|--------|
| 124| Jane Smith | Sales      | 68000  |
```

### Working with custom types in `json_populate_record`

The base record doesn't need to have the type of a table row and can be a [custom Postgres type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html) too. For example, here we first define a custom type `address` and use `json_populate_record` to cast a `JSON` object to it:

```sql
CREATE TYPE address AS (
    street TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    zip TEXT
);

SELECT *
FROM json_populate_record(
    NULL::address,
    '{"street": "123 Main St", "city": "San Francisco", "zip": "94105"}'
);
```

This query returns the following result:

```text
| street     | city          | zip   |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 123 Main St| San Francisco | 94105 |
```

## Additional considerations

### Alternative options

- [json_to_record](/docs/functions/json_to_record) - It can be used similarly, with a couple differences. `json_populate_record` can be used with a base record of a pre-defined type, whereas `json_to_record` needs the record type defined inline in the `AS` clause. Further, `json_populate_record` can specify default values for missing fields through the base record, whereas `json_to_record` must assign them NULL values.
- `json_populate_recordset` - It can be used similarly to parse `JSON`, the difference being that it returns a set of records instead of a single record. For example, if you have an array of `JSON` objects, you can use `json_populate_recordset` to convert each object into a new row. 
- [jsonb_populate_record](/docs/functions/jsonb_populate_record) - It has the same functionality to `json_populate_record`, but accepts `JSONB` input instead of `JSON`.

subtitle: Converts a JSON object to a record
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-06T14:40:40.248Z'
---

You can use the `json_to_record` function to convert a top-level `JSON` object into a row, with the type specified by the `AS` clause. 

This function is useful when you need to parse `JSON` data received from external sources, such as APIs or file uploads, and store it in a structured format. By using `json_to_record`, you can easily extract values from `JSON` and map them to the corresponding columns in your database table.

<CTA />

## Function signature

```sql
json_to_record(json JSON) AS (column_name column_type [, ...])
```

The function's definition includes a column definition list, where you specify the name and data type of each column in the resulting record. 

## Example usage

Consider a scenario in which you have `JSON` data representing employee information, and you want to ingest it for easier processing later. The `JSON` data looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": "75000"
}
```

The table you want to insert data into is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary NUMERIC
);
```

Using `json_to_record`, you can insert the input data into the `employees` table as shown:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
SELECT *
FROM json_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering", "salary": "75000"}') AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC);
```

To verify the data was inserted, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This query returns the following result:
```text
| id | name     | department   | salary |
|----|----------|--------------|--------|
| 123| John Doe | Engineering  | 75000  |
```

## Advanced examples

This section provides advanced `json_to_record` examples.

### Handling partial data with `json_to_record`

For datapoints where the `JSON` objects have missing keys, `json_to_record` can still cast them into records, producing `NULL` values for the unmatched columns. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
SELECT *
FROM json_to_record('{
  "id": "124",
  "name": "Jane Smith"
}') AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC)
RETURNING *;
```

This query returns the following result:

```
| id | name       | department   | salary |
|----|------------|--------------|--------|
| 124| Jane Smith |              |        |
```

### Handling nested data with `json_to_record`

`json_to_record` can also be used to handle nested `JSON` input data (i.e., keys with values that are `JSON` objects themselves). You need to first define a [custom Postgres type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html). The newly created type can then be used in the column definition list along with the other columns. 

In the following example, we handle the `address` field by creating an `ADDRESS_TYPE` type first. 

```sql
CREATE TYPE ADDRESS_TYPE AS (
  street TEXT,
  city TEXT
);

SELECT *
FROM json_to_record('{
  "id": "125",
  "name": "Emily Clark",
  "department": "Marketing",
  "salary": "68000",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Elm St",
    "city": "Springfield"
  }
}') AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC, address ADDRESS_TYPE);
```

This query returns the following result:
```text
| id | name        | department | salary | address                     |
|----|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | Emily Clark | Marketing  | 68000  | ("123 Elm St", Springfield) |
```

### Alternative functions

- [json_populate_record](/docs/functions/json_populate_record): This function can also be used to create records using values from a `JSON` object. The difference is that `json_populate_record` requires the record type to be defined beforehand, while `json_to_record` needs the type definition inline. 
- [json_to_recordset](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html): This function can be used similarly to parse `JSON`, the difference being that it returns a set of records instead of a single record. For example, if you have an array of `JSON` objects, you can use `json_to_recordset` to convert each object into a new row. 
- [jsonb_to_record](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html): This function provides the same functionality as `json_to_record`, but accepts `JSONB` input instead of `JSON`. In cases where the input payload type isn't exactly specified, either of the two functions can be used. For example, take this `json_to_record` query: 

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM json_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering"}') 
    AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT);
    ```
    It works just as well as this `JSONB` variant (below) since Postgres casts the literal `JSON` object to `JSON` or `JSONB` depending on the context.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM jsonb_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "Sally", "department": "Engineering"}')
    AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT);
    ```

jsonb_to_record(json JSONB) AS (column_name column_type [, ...])
```

The function's definition includes a column definition list, where you specify the name and data type of each column in the resulting record. 

## Example usage

Consider a scenario in which you have `JSONB` data representing employee information, and you want to ingest it for easier processing later. The `JSONB` data looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": "75000"
}
```

The table you want to insert data into is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary NUMERIC
);
```

Using `jsonb_to_record`, you can insert the input data into the `employees` table as shown:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
SELECT *
FROM jsonb_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering", "salary": "75000"}') AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC);
```

Note that the string representation of the JSON object didn't need to be explicitly cast to `JSONB`. Postgres automatically casts it to `JSONB` when the function is called. 

To verify the data was inserted, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This query returns the following result:
```text
| id | name     | department   | salary |
|----|----------|--------------|--------|
| 123| John Doe | Engineering  | 75000  |
```

| 124| Jane Smith |              |        |
```

### Handling nested data with `jsonb_to_record`

`jsonb_to_record` can also be used to handle nested `JSONB` input data (i.e., keys with values that are `JSONB` objects themselves). You need to first define a [custom Postgres type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html). The newly created type can then be used in the column definition list along with the other columns. 

In the following example, we handle the `address` field by creating an `ADDRESS_TYPE` type first. 

```sql
CREATE TYPE ADDRESS_TYPE AS (
  street TEXT,
  city TEXT
);

SELECT *
FROM jsonb_to_record('{
  "id": "125",
  "name": "Emily Clark",
  "department": "Marketing",
  "salary": "68000",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Elm St",
    "city": "Springfield"
  }
}') AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC, address ADDRESS_TYPE);
```

This query returns the following result:
```text
| id | name        | department | salary | address                     |
|----|-------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | Emily Clark | Marketing  | 68000  | ("123 Elm St", Springfield) |
```

### Alternative functions

- [jsonb_populate_record](/docs/functions/jsonb_populate_record): This function can also be used to create records using values from a `JSONB` object. The difference is that `jsonb_populate_record` requires the record type to be defined beforehand, while `jsonb_to_record` needs the type definition inline. 
- [jsonb_to_recordset](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html): This function can be used similarly to parse `JSONB`, the difference being that it returns a set of records instead of a single record. For example, if you have an array of `JSONB` objects, you can use `jsonb_to_recordset` to convert each object into a new row. 
- [json_to_record](/docs/functions/json_to_record): This function provides the same functionality as `json_to_record`, but accepts `JSON` input instead of `JSONB`. In cases where the input payload type isn't exactly specified, either of the two functions can be used. 

    For example, take this `json_to_record` query: 

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM json_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "department": "Engineering"}') 
    AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT);
    ```
    It works just as well as this `JSONB` variant (below) since Postgres casts the literal `JSON` object to `JSON` or `JSONB` depending on the context.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM jsonb_to_record('{"id": "123", "name": "Sally", "department": "Engineering"}')
    AS x(id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT);
    ```

updatedOn: '2024-02-16T12:00:44.905Z'

**Neon is Postgres**. However, as a managed Postgres service, there are some differences you should be aware of.

## Postgres versions

Neon supports Postgres 14, 15, and 16. You can select the Postgres version you want to use when creating a Neon project. Postgres 16 is selected by default. For information about creating a Neon project, See [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects). Minor Postgres point releases are rolled out by Neon after extensive validation as part of regular platform maintenance.  

## Postgres extensions

Neon supports numerous Postgres extensions, and we regularly add support for more. For the extensions that Neon supports, see [Postgres Extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions). To request support for additional extensions, please reach out to us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/92vNTzKDGp). Please keep in mind that privilege requirements, local file system access, and functionality that is incompatible with Neon features such as Autoscaling and Autosuspend may prevent Neon from being able to offer support for certain extensions.

## Roles and permissions

Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres `superuser` account. In place of the Postgres superuser role, Neon provides a `neon_superuser` role.

Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. For information about the privileges associated with this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

Roles created in Neon with SQL syntax, from a command-line tool like `psql` or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), have the same privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have. For more information, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

Neon roles cannot install Postgres extensions other than those supported by Neon.

<a id="default-parameters/"></a>

## Neon Postgres parameter settings

The following table lists Neon Postgres parameter settings that may differ from the expected default.

| Parameter       | Value   | Note                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fsync           | off     | Neon syncs data to the Neon Storage Engine to store your data safely and reliably |
| max_connections |         | The value depends on compute size.          |
| shared_buffers  |         | The value depends on compute size                                                 |

<Admonition type="note">
You can use connection pooling in Neon to increase the number of supported connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).
</Admonition>

## Postgres server logs

Currently, Postgres server logs can only be accessed Neon Support team. Should you require information from the Postgres server logs for troubleshooting purposes, please contact [Neon Support](/docs/introduction/support).

## Unlogged tables

Unlogged tables are maintained on Neon compute local storage. These tables do not survive compute restarts (including when a Neon compute instance is placed into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity). This is unlike a standalone Postgres installation, where unlogged tables are only truncated in the event of abnormal process termination. Additionally, unlogged tables are limited by compute local storage size.

## Memory

SQL queries and index builds can generate large volumes of data that may not fit in memory. In Neon, the size of your compute determines the amount of memory that is available. For information about compute size and available memory, see [How to size your compute](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

## Temporary tables

Temporary tables, which are stored in compute local storage, are limited by compute local storage size.

## Session context

The Neon cloud service automatically closes idle connections after a period of inactivity, as described in [Compute lifecycle](/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/). When connections are closed, anything that exists within a session context is forgotten and must be recreated before being used again. For example, in-memory statistics, temporary tables, prepared statements, advisory locks, and notifications and listeners defined using [NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-notify.html)/[LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-listen.html) commands only exist for the duration of the current session and are lost when the session ends.

## Statistics collection

Statistics collected by the Postgres [cumulative statistics system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html) are currently not saved when the Neon compute node is placed into an `Idle` state due to inactivity or restarted. For information about the lifecycle of a Neon compute, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/).

## Database encoding

Neon does not currently support changing the database encoding. However, Neon does support [ICU Custom Collations](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html#ICU-CUSTOM-COLLATIONS), which lets you define collation objects using ICU as the collation provider. For example:

```sql
CREATE COLLATION german (provider = icu, locale = 'de');
CREATE TABLE books (id int, title text COLLATE "german");
``` 

or 

```sql
CREATE COLLATION arabic (provider = icu, locale = 'ar');
CREATE TABLE books (id int, title text COLLATE "arabic");
```

## Event triggers

Postgres [event triggers](/docs/current/event-triggers.html), which require Postgres superuser privileges, are currently not supported. Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.

Attempting to create an event trigger will produce errors similar to these:

```sql
ERROR: permission denied to create event trigger "your_trigger_name" (SQLSTATE 42501)

ERROR:  permission denied to create event trigger "your_trigger_name"
HINT:  Must be superuser to create an event trigger.
```

## PostgreSQL documentation

Neon provides a mirror of the official PostgreSQL documentation on the [Neon documentation site](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction) for the convenience of our users. As Neon is built on standard PostgreSQL, most information from the official PostgreSQL documentation applies to our platform. However, there are a few key differences to consider when referencing the official PostgreSQL docs:

- As a managed Postgres service, certain aspects of the official PostgreSQL documentation like installation procedures do not apply to Neon.
- Some features detailed in the official PostgreSQL documentation may not be relevant for Neon, such as those mentioned on this Postgres compatibility page.
- Features requiring the PostgreSQL superuser privilege may not be supported. See [Roles and permissions](#roles-and-permissions) above.
- Neon may not support all of the extensions mentioned in the official PostgreSQL documentation. See [Postgres extensions](#postgres-extensions) above.

This topic describes migrating data from another Postgres database to Neon using the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` command line utilities.

<Admonition type="important">
Avoid using `pg_dump` over a [pooled connection string](/docs/reference/glossary#pooled-connection-string) (see PgBouncer issues [452](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/452) & [976](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/976) for details). Use an [unpooled connection string](/docs/reference/glossary#unpooled-connection-string) instead.
</Admonition>

Repeat the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` process for each database you want to migrate.

## Before you begin

- Neon supports PostgreSQL 14, 15, and 16. We recommend that clients are the same version as source Postgres instance. To check the version of `pg_dump` or `pg_restore`, use the `-V` option. For example: `pg_dump -V`
- Retrieve the connection parameters or connection string for your source Postgres database. The instructions below use a [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING), but you can use the connection format you prefer. If you are logged in to a local Postgres instance, you may only need to provide the database name. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for information about connection parameters.
- Optionally, create a role in Neon to perform the restore operation. The role that performs the restore operation becomes the owner of restored database objects. For example, if you want role `sally` to own database objects, create `role` sally in Neon and perform the restore operation as `sally`.
- If you have assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, read [Database object ownership considerations](#database-object-ownership-considerations). You may want to add the `-O, --no-owner` option to your `pg_restore` command to avoid errors.
- Create the target database in Neon. For example, if you are migrating a database named `pagila`, create a database named `pagila` in Neon. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
- Retrieve the connection string for your Neon database. You can find it in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. It will look something like this:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

- Consider running a test migration first to ensure your actual migration goes smoothly. See [Run a test migration](#run-a-test-migration).
- If your database is small, you can pipe `pg_dump` output directly to `pg_restore` to save time. See [Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore](#pipe-pgdump-to-pgrestore).

## Export data with pg_dump

Export your data from the source database with `pg_dump`:

```bash shouldWrap
pg_dump -Fc -v -d <source_database_connection_string> -f <dump_file_name> 
```

The `pg_dump` command above includes these arguments:

- `-Fc`: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into `pg_restore`.
- `-v`: Runs `pg_dump` in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the dump operation.
- `-d`: Specifies the source database name or [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
- `-f`: The dump file name. It can be any name you choose (`mydumpfile.bak`, for example).

For more command options, see [Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options](#advanced-pgdump-and-pgrestore-options).

## Restore data to Neon with pg_restore

Restore your data to the target database in Neon with `pg_restore`.

<Admonition type="note">
If you assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, consider adding the `-O, --no-owner` option to your `pg_restore` command to avoid errors. See [Database object ownership considerations](#database-object-ownership-considerations).
</Admonition>

```bash shouldWrap
pg_restore -v -d <neon_database_connection_string> <dump_file_name>
```

The example above includes these arguments:

- `-v`: Runs `pg_restore` in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the restore operation.
- `-d`: Specifies the Neon database to connect to. The value is a Neon database connection string. See [Before you begin](#before-you-begin).
- `<dump_file_name>` is the name of the dump file you created with `pg_dump`.

For more command options, see [Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options](#advanced-pgdump-and-pgrestore-options).

## pg_dump and pg_restore example

The following example shows how data from a `pagila` source database is dumped and restored to a `pagila` database in Neon using the commands described in the previous sections. (A database named `pagila` was created in Neon prior to running the restore operation.)

```bash shouldWrap
~$ cd mydump
~/mydump$ pg_dump -Fc -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila -f mydumpfile.bak 

~/mydump$ ls
mydumpfile.bak

~/mydump$ pg_restore -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila mydumpfile.bak
```

## Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore

For small databases, the standard output of `pg_dump` can be piped directly into a `pg_restore` command to minimize migration downtime:

```bash
pg_dump [args] | pg_restore [args]
```

For example:

```bash shouldWrap
pg_dump -Fc -v -d <source_database_connection_string> | pg_restore -v -d <neon-database-connection-string>
```

Piping is not recommended for large databases, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy migration operations.

When piping `pg_dump` output directly to `pg_restore`, the custom output format (`-Fc`) is most efficient. The directory format (`-Fd`) format cannot be piped to `pg_restore`.

## Post-migration steps

After migrating your data, update your applications to connect to your new database in Neon. You will need the database connection string that you used in your `pg_restore` command. If you run into any problems, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app). After connecting your applications, test them thoroughly to ensure they function correctly with your new database.

## Database object ownership considerations

Roles created in the Neon console, including the default role created with your Neon project, are automatically granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role. This role can create roles and databases, select from all tables and views, and insert, update, or delete data in all tables. However, the `neon_superuser` is not a PostgreSQL `superuser`. It cannot run `ALTER OWNER` statements to grant ownership of database objects. As a result, if you granted ownership of database objects in your source database to different roles, your dump file will contain `ALTER OWNER` statements, and those statements will cause non-fatal errors when you restore data to your Neon database.

<Admonition type="note">
Regardless of `ALTER OWNER` statement errors, a restore operation still succeeds because assigning ownership is not necessary for the data itself to be restored. The restore operation will still create tables, import data, and create other objects.
</Admonition>

To avoid the non-fatal errors, you can ignore database object ownership statements when restoring data by specifying the `-O, --no-owner` option in your `pg_restore` command:

```bash shouldWrap
pg_restore -v -O -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila mydumpfile.bak 
```

The Neon role performing the restore operation becomes the owner of all database objects.

## Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options

The `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands provide numerous advanced options, some of which are described below. Full descriptions and more options are found in the PostgreSQL [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) documentation.

### pg_dump options

- `-Z`: Defines the compression level to use when using a compressible format. 0 means no compression, while 9 means maximum compression. In general, we recommend a setting of 1. A higher compression level slows the dump and restore process but also uses less disk space.
- `--lock-wait-timeout=20s`: Error out early in the dump process instead of waiting for an unknown amount of time if there is lock contention.
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump. Instead fail if unable to lock a table within the specified timeout.`
- `-j <njobs>`: Consider this option for large databases to dump tables in parallel. Set `<njobs>` to the number of available CPUs. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only make sense for Neon paid plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU.
- `--no-blobs`: Excludes large objects from your dump. See [Data migration notes](#data-migration-notes).

### pg_restore options

- `-c --if-exists`: Drop database objects before creating them if they already exist. If you had a failed migration, you can use these options to drop objects created by the previous migration to avoid errors when retrying the migration.
- `-j <njobs>`: Consider this option for large databases to run the restore process in parallel. Set `<njobs>` to the number of available vCPUs. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only makes sense for Neon paid plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU. It cannot be used together with `--single-transaction`.
- `--single-transaction`: Forces the operation to run as an atomic transaction, which ensures that no data is left behind when a restore operation fails. Retrying an import operation after a failed attempt that leaves data behind may result in "duplicate key value" errors.
- `--no-tablespaces`: Do not output commands to select tablespaces. See [Data migration notes](#data-migration-notes).
- `-t <table_name>`: Allows you to restore individual tables from a custom-format database dump. Individual tables can also be imported from a CSV file. See [Import from CSV](/docs/import/import-from-csv).

## Run a test migration

It is recommended that you run a test migration before migrating your production database. Make sure you can successfully migrate data to the new database and connect to it. Before starting the actual migration, create a database dump and address any issues that show up. In Neon, you can quickly create a test database, obtain the connection string, and delete the database when you are finished with it. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).

## Other migration options

This section discusses migration options other than `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

### Postgres GUI clients

Some Postgres clients offer backup and restore capabilities. These include [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/backup_and_restore.html) and [phppgadmin](https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/releases), among others. We have not tested migrations using these clients, but if you are uncomfortable using command-line utilities, they may provide an alternative.

### Table-level data migration

Table-level data migration (using CSV files, for example) does not preserve database schemas, constraints, indexes, types, or other database features. You will have to create these separately. Table-level migration is simple but could result in significant downtime depending on the size of your data and the number of tables. For instructions, see [Import data from CSV](/docs/import/import-from-csv).

## Data migration notes

- You can load data using the `psql` utility, but it only supports plain-text SQL dumps, which you should only consider for small datasets or specific use cases. To create a plain-text SQL dump with `pg_dump` utility, leave out the `-F` format option. Plain-text SQL is the default `pg_dump` output format.
- `pg_dumpall` is not supported.
- `pg_dump` with the `-C, --create` option is not supported.
- Some PostgreSQL features, such as tablespaces and large objects, which require access to the local file system are not supported by Neon. To exclude selecting tablespaces, specify the `--no-tablespaces` option with `pg_restore`. To exclude large objects, specify the `--no-blobs` option with `pg_dump`.

# Import from a Neon project

title: Import data from another Neon project
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.292Z'
---

This guide describes how to migrate a database from one Neon project to another by piping data from `pg_dump` to `pg_restore`. Use these instructions to:

- Import a database from a Neon project created in one region to a project created in another region.
- Import a database from a Neon project created with one Postgres version to a Neon project created with another Postgres version.

## Important considerations

- **Upgrading the Postgres version**: When upgrading to a new version of Postgres, always test thoroughly before migrating your production systems or applications. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with the changes in the new version of Postgres, especially those affecting compatibility. For information about those changes, please refer to the official Postgres [Release 15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.0/) or [Release 16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html) documentation.
- **Piping considerations**: Piping is not recommended for large datasets, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy migration operations (see [Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore](/docs/import/import-from-postgres#pipe-pgdump-to-pgrestore) for more information). If your dataset is large, we recommend performing the dump and restore as separate operations. For instructions, see [Import data from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).
- **Neon Free Tier project limit**: The Neon Free Tier has a limit of one project per user, which means a Neon Free Tier user cannot have two projects simultaneously. To move your data from a Neon Free Tier project, dump your database first, delete your Neon project, create a new Neon project with the desired region or Postgres version, and import your data into the new project. For the dump and restore procedure, refer to [Import from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).

## Import data from another project

To import your data from another Neon project:

1. Create a new project with the desired region or Postgres version. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project) for instructions.

2. Create a database with the desired name in your new Neon project. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

3. Retrieve the connection strings for the new and existing Neon databases.

   You can obtain the connection strings from the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**. Connections strings have this format:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

4. Prepare your import command to pipe data to from one Neon project to the other. The command will look similar to this:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   pg_dump -Fc -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname] | pg_restore -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   The command includes these arguments:

   - `-Fc`: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into `pg_restore`.
   - `-v`: Runs commands in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the operation.
   - `-d`: Specifies the database name or connection string.

5. Run the command from your terminal or command window.
6. If you no longer require the old project, you can remove it. See [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project) for instructions.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.292Z'

This topic describes how to import data into a Neon database table from a CSV file.

The instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres. For more information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

The following example uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database that is created with your Neon project, a table named `customer`, and a data file named `customer.csv`. Data is loaded from the `customer.csv` file into the `customer` table.

1. Connect to the `neondb` database using `psql`. For example:

   ```bash shouldWrap
   psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   <Admonition type="note">
   For more information about connecting to Neon with `psql`, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).
   </Admonition>

2. Create the `customer` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE customer (
     id SERIAL,
     first_name VARCHAR(50),
     last_name VARCHAR(50),
     email VARCHAR(255),
     PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   ```

   <Admonition type="tip">
   You can also create tables using the **SQL Editor** in the Neon Console. See [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).
   </Admonition>

3. Prepare a `customer.csv` file with the following data:

   ```text
   First Name,Last Name,Email
   1,Casey,Smith,casey.smith@example.com
   2,Sally,Jones,sally.jones@example.com
   ```

4. From your `psql` prompt, load the data from the `customer.csv` file using the `\copy` option.

   ```bash
   \copy customer FROM '/path/to/customer.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
   ```

   If the command runs successfully, it returns the number of records copied to the database:

   ```bash
   COPY 2
   ```

   For more information about the `\copy` option, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

This guide describes how to import your data from Heroku Postgres to Neon.

The instructions assume that you have installed the Heroku CLI, which is used to transfer data from Heroku. For installation instructions, see [The Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

To migrate your data from Heroku to Neon:

1. [Create a Neon project and copy the connection string](#create-a-neon-project-and-copy-the-connection-string)
2. [Retrieve your Heroku app name and database name](#retrieve-your-heroku-app-name-and-database-name)
3. [Import your data](#import-your-data)
4. [Verify that your data was imported](#verify-that-your-data-was-imported)

## Create a Neon project and copy the connection string

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.
4. After creating a project, you are directed to the Neon **Dashboard**, where a connection string with your password is provided under **Connection Details**. Copy the connection string. It is required to import your data from Heroku.

    The example connection string used the instructions that follow is:

    ```text shouldWrap
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

## Retrieve your Heroku app name and database name

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and select the project you want to import data from.
1. Select **Overview** and copy the name of the Heroku Postgres database, which appears under **Installed add-ons**.
1. Click **Settings** and copy your Heroku **App Name**.

<Admonition type="note">
You can also retrieve the Heroku Postgres database name using the following Heroku CLI command:
</Admonition>

```shell
heroku pg:links --app <app>
```

where `<app>` is the Heroku App Name.

For example:

```shell
$ heroku pg:links --app thawing-wave-57227
=== postgresql-trapezoidal-48645
```

## Import your data

From your terminal, run the following Heroku CLI command:

```shell
heroku pg:pull --app [app] [heroku-pg-database] [neon-connection-string]
```

where:

- `[app]` is the name of the Heroku app
- `[heroku-pg-database]` is the name of the Heroku PostgreSQL database
- `[neon-connection-string]` is the Neon connection string

For example:

```shell shouldWrap
$ heroku pg:pull --app thawing-wave-57227 postgresql-trapezoidal-48645 postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname

# Migrate data with AWS DMS

---
title: Migrate with AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.294Z'
---

This guide outlines the steps for using the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate data to Neon from another hosted database server. AWS DMS supports a variety of database migration sources including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. For a complete list of data migration sources supported by AWS DMS, see [Source endpoints for data migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Introduction.Sources.html#CHAP_Introduction.Sources.DataMigration).

For additional information about particular steps in the migration process, refer to the [official AWS DMS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). If you are not familiar with AWS DMS, we recommend stepping through the [Getting started with AWS Database Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html) tutorial.

If you encounter problems with AWS DMS that are not related to defining Neon as a data migration target endpoint, please contact [AWS Customer Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

This guide uses the [AWS DMS sample Postgres database](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-database-migration-samples/blob/master/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/README.md) for which the schema name is `dms_sample`.

## Before you begin

Complete the following steps before you begin:

- Create a [replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Creating.html) in AWS DMS.
- Configure a [source database endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.html) in AWS DMS.
- Set up a Neon project and a target database. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project), and [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#delete-a-database) for instructions.
- If you are migrating from a database other than Postgres, use the [Schema Conversion Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.SCT.html) or [DMS Schema Conversion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to convert and export the schema from the source database to the target database. Perform this step after creating the target endpoint for the Neon database but before the data migration. If migrating from a Postgres database, schema conversion is not required.

## Create a target endpoint for your Neon database

1. In the AWS Console, select **Database Migration Service**.
2. Select **Endpoints** from the sidebar.
3. Click **Create endpoint**.
4. Select **Target endpoint** as the **Endpoint type**.
5. Provide an **Endpoint identifier** label for your new target endpoint. In this guide, we use `neon` as the identifier.
6. In the **Target engine** drop-down menu, select `PostgreSQL`.
7. Under **Access to endpoint database**, select **Provide access information manually** and enter the information outlined below. You can obtain the connection details from your Neon connection string, which you can find in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Your  connection string will look similar to this: `postgres://daniel:AbC123dEf@ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb"`.

    - **Server name**: Specify your Neon hostname, which is this portion of your connection string: `ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
    - **Port**: `5432`
    - **User name**: Specify the Neon user.
    - **Password**: Specify the password in the following format: `endpoint=[endpoint_id]$[password]`, which looks similar to this when defined:

      ```text
      endpoint=ep-curly-term-54009904$AbC123dEf
      ```

      You can obtain the `endpoint_id` and password from your Neon connection string. The `endpoint_id` appears similar to this: `ep-curly-term-54009904`. For information about why this password format is required, see [Connection errors](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified). AWS DMS requires the [Option D workaround](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#d-specify-the-endpoint-id-in-the-password-field).

    - **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mode**: Select `require`.
    - **Database name**: The name of your Neon database. In this example, we use a database named `neondb`

      When finished, your target endpoint configuration should look similar to this:
      ![Endpoint configuration dialog](/docs/import/endpoint_configuration.png)

9. Under **Test endpoint connection (optional)**, click **Run test** to test the connection. Running the test creates the endpoint and attempts to connect to it. If the connection fails, you can edit the endpoint definition and test the connection again.
10. Select **Create endpoint**.

## Create a database migration task

A database migration task defines the data to be migrated from the source database to the target database.

1. In AWS DMS, select **Database migration tasks** from the sidebar.
2. Select **Create task** to open a **Create database migration task** page.
3. Enter a **Task identifier** to identify the replication task. In this example, we name the identifier `dms-task`.
4. Select the **Replication instance**. In this guide, the replication instance is named `dms_instance`.
5. Select the **Source database endpoint**. In this guide, the replication instance is named `dms_postgresql`.
5. Select the **Target database endpoint**. In this guide, the target database endpoint identifier is `neon`.  
6. Select a **Migration type**. In this example, we use the default `Migrate existing data` type.
![DMS database migration task configuration](/docs/import/dms_task_configuration.png)

### Task settings

Specify the following task settings:

1. For **Editing mode**, select **Wizard**.
2. For Target table preparation mode, select **Do nothing**. This option means that AWS DMS only creates tables in the target database if they do not exist.
3. For the **LOB column** setting, select **Don't include LOB columns**. Neon does not support LOB columns.
4. Optionally, under **Validation**, check **Turn on** to compare the data after the load operation finishes to ensure that data was migrated accurately. For more information about validation, refer to the [AWS data validation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Validating.html).

You can also check **Enable CloudWatch logs** and set **Target Load** to **Debug** or **Detailed debug** to log information during the migration process. This data is useful for troubleshooting migration issues.
![DMS database migration task settings](/docs/import/dms_task_settings.png)

### Table mappings

Configure the table mapping:

1. For **Editing mode**, select **Wizard**.
2. Under **Selection rules**, click **Add new selection rule**.
3. For **Schema**, select **Enter a schema**.
4. For **Source name**, enter the name of your database schema. In this guide, `dms_sample` is specified as the schema name, which is the schema for the sample database. The `dms_sample` schema will be created in your Neon database, and all database objects will be created in the schema.
5. For the **Source table name**, leave the `%` wildcard character to load all tables in the schema.
6. For **Action**, select **Include** to migrate the objects specified by your selection rule.
![DMS database migration task table mappings](/docs/import/dms_task_table_mappings.png)

### Migration task startup configuration

1. Under ***Migration task startup configuration**, select **Automatically on create**.
2. Click **Start migration task** at the bottom of the page. The data migration task is created, and the data migration operation is initiated. You can monitor operation progress on the AWS DMS **Database migrations tasks** page.
![DMS database migration task status](/docs/import/dms_migration_status.png)

## Verify the migration in Neon

To verify that data was migrated to your Neon database:

1. In the Neon Console, select your Neon project.
2. Select **Tables** from the side bar.
3. Select the **Branch**, **Database**, and **Schema** where you imported the data.
![Neon Tables view showing imported data](/docs/import/dms_neon_table_data.png).

## Migration notes

This section contains notes from our experience using AWS DMS to migrate data to Neon from an RDS Postgres database.

- When testing migration steps, the the [Getting started with AWS Database Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html) tutorial was our primary reference. As recommended in the tutorial, we created a VPC and created all resources within the VPC.
- We created all resources in the same region (`us-east-2a`)
- We created an RDS PostgreSQL 15 database called `dms_sample` as the source database. The Neon target database was also Postgres 15.
- We populated the RDS PostgreSQL source database using the [AWS DMS sample Postgres database](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-database-migration-samples/blob/master/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/README.md). To do this, we created an EC2 instance to connect to the database following the steps in this topic: [Create an Amazon EC2 Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.Prerequisites.html#CHAP_GettingStarted.Prerequisites.client).
- The source database was populated using this `psql` command:

  ```bash shouldWrap
  psql -h dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U postgres -d dms_sample -a -f ~/aws-database-migration-samples/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/postgresql.sql
  ```

- To verify that data was loaded in the source database, we connected using the following `psql` command and ran a `SELECT` query:

    ```bash
    psql \
    --host=dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com \
    --port=5432 \
    --username=postgres \
    --password \
    --dbname=dms_sample


    dms_sample=> SELECT * from dms_sample.player LIMIT 100;
    ```

- When creating the source database endpoint for the RDS Postgres 15 database, we set **Secure Socket Layer (SSL) mode** to `require`. Without this setting, we encountered the following error:

    ```text shouldWrap
    Test Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Failed to connect Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.0.1.135", user "postgres", database "dms_sample", no encryption
    ```

- When creating the target database endpoint for the Neon database, we encountered the following error when testing the connection:

    ```text shouldWrap
    Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Cannot connect to ODBC provider Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: timeout expired
    ```

    The replication instance, which was created in the private subnet where the source database resided, could not access the Neon database, which resides outside of the VPC. To allow the replication instance to access the Neon database, we added a NAT Gateway to the public subnet, allocated an Elastic IP address, and modified the **Route Table** associated with the private subnet to add a route via the NAT Gateway.


# Migrate from MySQL to Postgres

---
title: Migrate your MySQL database to Neon Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
isDraft: false
---

This topic describes how to migrate your MySQL database to Neon Postgres using [pgloader](https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).

The `pgloader` utility transforms data to a Postgres-compatible format as it is read from your MySQL database. It uses the `COPY` Postgres protocol to stream the data into your Postgres database.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following:

- A Neon account and a project. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A properly named database. For example, if you are migrating a database named `sakila`, you might want to create a database of the same name in Neon. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.
- Neon's Free Tier supports 500 MiB of data. If your data size is more than 500 MiB, you'll need to upgrade to one of Neon's paid plans. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans) for more information.

Also, a close review of the [Pgloader MySQL to Postgres Guide](https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/mysql.html) guide is recommended before you start. This guide will provide you with a good understanding of `pgloader` capabilities and how to configure your `pgloader` configuration file, if necessary.

## Retrieve Your MySQL database credentials

Before starting the migration process, collect your MySQL database credentials:

1. Log into your MySQL database provider.
2. Identify and record the following details or grab your MySQL database connection string.
   - Hostname or IP address
   - Database name
   - Username
   - Password

Keep your MySQL database connection details handy for later use.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the **Connection Details** section on the **Dashboard** to find your Postgres database connection string. It should look similar to this:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Now, modify the connection string as follows to pass your **endpoint ID** (`ep-cool-darkness-123456` in this example) to Neon with your password using the `endpoint` keyword, as shown here:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456;AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require // [!code word:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456;AbC123dEf]
```

<Admonition type="note">
Passing the `endpoint ID` with your password is a required workaround for some Postgres drivers, including the one used by `pgloader`. For more information about this workaround and why it's required, refer to our [connection workaround](/docs/connect/connection-errors#d-specify-the-endpoint-id-in-the-password-field) documentation. 
</Admonition>

Keep your Neon connection string handy for later use.

### Install pgloader

Here's how you can set up `pgloader` for your database migration:

1. Install the `pgloader` utility using your preferred installation method. Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker methods are supported, as well as Homebrew for macOS (`brew install pgloader`). If your macOS has an ARM processor, use the Homebrew installation method. 

   See [Installing pgloader](https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker installation instructions. 
2. Create a `pgloader` configuration file (e.g., `config.load`). Use your MySQL database credentials to define the connection string for your database source. Use the Neon database connection string you retrieved and modified in the previous step as the destination.

   <Admonition type="note">
   If you need to specify an SSL mode in your connection string, the following format is recommended: `sslmode=require`. Other formats may not work.
   </Admonition>

   Example configuration in `config.load`:
   
   ```plaintext
   load database
     from mysql://user:password@host/source_db?sslmode=require
     into postgres://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require;
   ```

## Run the migration with pgloader

To initiate the migration process, run:

```shell
pgloader config.load
```

The command output will look similar to this:

```bash
LOG report summary reset
             table name     errors       rows      bytes      total time

```

## SSL verify error

If you encounter an `SSL verify error: 20 X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY` error while attempting the instructions described above using `pgloader` from a Docker container, try the solution identified in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader/issues/768#issuecomment-693390290), which involves specifying `sslmode=allow` in the Postgres connection string and using the `--no-ssl-cert-verification` option with `pgloader`. 

The following configuration file and Docker command were verified to work with Docker on Windows but may apply generally when using `pgloader` in a Docker container. In your `pgloader` config file, replace the MySQL and Postgres connection string values with your own. In the Docker command, specify the path to your `pgloader` config file, and replace the container ID value (the long alphanumeric string) with your own.

`pgloader` config.load file: 

```plaintext
load database
  from mysql://user:password@host/source_db?sslmode=require
  into postgresql://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=allow;
``````

Docker command:

```plaintext
docker run -v C:\path\to\config.load:/config.load d183dc100d3af5e703bd867b3b7826c117fa16b7ee2cd360af591dc895b121dc pgloader --no-ssl-cert-verification /config.load
```

This guide describes how to download and install sample data for use with Neon.

## Prerequisites

- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for downloading datasets, unless otherwise instructed. If your system does not support `wget`, you can paste the source file address in your browser's address bar.
- A `psql` client for connecting to your Neon database and loading data. This client is included with a standalone PostgreSQL installation. See [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- A `pg_restore` client if you are loading the [employees](#employees-database) or [postgres_air](#postgres-air-database) database. The `pg_restore` client is included with a standalone PostgreSQL installation. See [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- A Neon database connection string. After creating a database, you can obtain the connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. In the instructions that follow, replace `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]` with your connection string.
- A Neon [Pro](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account if you intend to install a dataset larger than 3 GB.
- Instructions for each dataset require that you create a database. You can do so from a client such as `psql` or from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

## Load sample data with the Neon CLI

You can load data with the Neon CLI by passing the `--psql` option, which calls the `psql` command line utility.

The Neon CLI and `psql` must be installed on your system. For installation instructions, see:

- [Neon CLI â Install and connect](/docs/reference/cli-install)
- [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for `psql`

If you have multiple Neon projects or branches, we recommend setting your Neon CLI project and branch context so that you don't have to specify them explicitly when running a Neon CLI command. See [Neon CLI commands â set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context).

To load sample data:

1. Download one of the data files listed above. For example:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neondatabase/postgres-sample-dbs/main/periodic_table.sql
    ```

    Alternatively, supply your own data file.

2. Load the data using one of the following Neon CLI commands ([projects](/docs/reference/cli-projects), [branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches), or [connection-string](/docs/reference/cli-connection-string)):

    - Create a new Neon project, connect to it with `psql`, and run the `.sql` file.

        ```bash
        neonctl projects create --psql -- -f periodic_table.sql
        ```

    - Create a branch, connect to it with `psql`, and run the an `.sql` file.

        ```bash
        neonctl branches create --psql -- -f periodic_table.sql
        ```

    - Get a connection string, connect with `psql`, and run the `.sql` file.

        ```bash
        neonctl connection-string --psql -- -f periodic_table.sql
        ```

At Neon, security is our highest priority. We are committed to implementing best practices and earning the trust of our users. A key aspect of earning this trust is by ensuring that every touchpoint in our system, from connections, to data storage, to our internal processes, adheres to the highest security standards.

## Secure connections

Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties.

Neon supports the `verify-full` SSL mode for client connections, which is the strictest SSL mode provided by PostgreSQL. When set to `verify-full`, a PostgreSQL client verifies that the server's certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), and that the server host name matches the name stored in the certificate. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. For information about configuring `verify-full` SSL mode for your connections, see [Connect securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).

In addition, Neon requires a 60-bit entropy password for all PostgreSQL roles. This degree of entropy ensures that passwords have a high level of randomness. Assuming a perfect distribution of choices for every bit of entropy, a password with 60 bits of entropy has 2^60 (or about 1.15 quintillion) possible combinations, which makes it computationally infeasible for attackers to guess the password through brute-force methods. For Neon users created via the Neon Console, API, and CLI, passwords are generated with 60-bit entropy. For SQL users created via SQL, user-defined passwords are validated at user-creation time to ensure 60-bit entropy.

## IP allowlist support

Neon's IP Allow feature, available with the [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan, ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). To learn more, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Data-at-rest encryption

Data-at-rest encryption is a method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in [NVMe SSD volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes). The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an `XTS-AES-256` block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.

## Secure data centers

Neonâs infrastructure is hosted and managed within Amazonâs secure data centers backed by [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). Amazon continually manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to ensure compliance with industry standards. For information about AWS data center compliance programs, refer to [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).

## SOC 2 compliance

Neon has successfully completed SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 audits. For more information, see [SOC 2 compliance](soc2-compliance).

You can request access to our SOC 2 report or directly download the public-facing SOC 3 compliance report on our [Neon Trust Center](https://trust.neon.tech/).

## Security reporting

Neon adheres to the [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/) standard for transparent and efficient security reporting. For details on how to report potential vulnerabilities, please visit our [Security reporting](/docs/security/security-reporting) page or refer to our [security.txt](https://neon.tech/security.txt) file.

## Questions about our security measures?

If you have any questions about our security protocols or would like a deeper dive into any aspect, our team is here to help. You can reach us at [security@neon.tech](mailto:security@neon.tech).

| [--analytics](#analytics) | Manage analytics                    | boolean| true                              |
| [-v, --version](#version)   | Show the Neon CLI version number                 | boolean| -                                 |
| [-h, --help](#help)      | Show the Neon CLI help                           | boolean| -                                 |

- <a id="output"></a>`-o, --output`

  Sets the output format. Supported options are `json`, `yaml`, and `table`. The default is `table`. Table output may be limited. The `json` and `yaml` output formats show all data.

  ```bash
  neonctl me --output json
  ```

- <a id="config-dir"></a>`--config-dir`

  Specifies the path to the `neonctl` configuration directory. To view the default configuration directory containing you `credentials.json` file, run `neonctl --help`. The credentials file is created when you authenticate using the `neonctl auth` command. This option is only necessary if you move your `neonctl` configuration file to a location other than the default.

  ```bash
  neonctl projects list --config-dir /home/<user>/.config/neonctl
  ```

- <a id="api-key"></a>`--api-key`

  Specifies your Neon API key. You can authenticate using a Neon API key when running a Neon CLI command instead of using `neonctl auth`. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

  ```bash
  neonctl <command> --api-key <neon_api_key>
  ```

  To avoid including the `--api-key` option with each CLI command, you can export your API key to the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable.

  ```bash
  export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
  ```
  
  <Admonition type="info">
  The authentication flow for the Neon CLI follows this order:

  - If the `--api-key` option is provided, it is used for authentication.
  - If the `--api-key` option is not provided, the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting is used.
  - If there is no `--api-key` option or `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting, the CLI looks for the `credentials.json` file created by the `neonctl auth` command.
  - If the credentials file is not found, the Neon CLI initiates the `neonctl auth` web authentication process.
  </Admonition>
  
- <a id="analytics"></a>`--analytics`

  Analytics are enabled by default to gather information about the CLI commands and options that are used by our customers. This data collection assists in offering support, and allows for a better understanding of typical usage patterns so that we can improve user experience. Neon does not collect user-defined data, such as project IDs or command payloads. To opt-out of analytics data collection, specify `--no-analytics` or `--analytics false`.

- <a id="version"></a>`-v, --version`

  Shows the Neon CLI version number.

  ```bash
  $ neonctl --version
  1.15.0
  ```

- <a id="help"></a>`-h, --help`

  Shows the `neonctl` command-line help. You can view help for `neonctl`, a `neonctl` command, or a `neonctl` subcommand, as shown in the following examples:

  ```bash
  neonctl --help
 
  neonctl branches --help
  
  neonctl branches create --help
  ```

## Connect

The Neon CLI supports connecting via web authentication or API key.

### Web authentication

Run the following command to connect to Neon via web authentication:

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. If you have not authenticated previously, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the web authentication process unless you have specified an API key.

### API key

To authenticate with a Neon API key, you can specify the `--api-key` option when running a Neon CLI command. For example, the following `neonctl projects list` command authenticates to Neon using the `--api-key` option:

```bash
neonctl projects list --api-key <neon_api_key>
```

To avoid including the `--api-key` option with each CLI command, you can export your API key to the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
```

For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

## Configure autocompletion

The Neon CLI supports autocompletion, which you can configure in a few easy steps. See [Neon CLI commands â completion](/docs/reference/cli-completion) for instructions.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T17:27:58.298Z'
---

## Before you begin

Before running the `auth` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).

## The `auth` command

Authenticates the user or caller to Neon.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. After granting permissions to the Neon CLI, your credentials are saved locally to a configuration file named `credentials.json`, enabling you manage your account's projects from the command line.

```text
/home/<home>/.config/neonctl/credentials.json
```

An alternative to authenticating using `neon auth` is to provide an API key when running a CLI command. You can do this using the global `--api-key` option or by setting the `NEON_API_KEY` variable. See [Global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options) for instructions.

<Admonition type="info">
The authentication flow for the Neon CLI follows this order:

## Before you begin

- Before running the `projects` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about projects in Neon, see [Projects](/docs/manage/projects).

## The `projects` command

The `projects` command allows you to list, create, update, delete, and retrieve information about Neon projects.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl projects <subcommand> [options]
```

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List projects    |
| [create](#create)  | Create a project |
| [update](#update)  | Update a project |
| [delete](#delete)  | Delete a project |
| [get](#get)     | Get a project    |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list projects that belong to your Neon account.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl projects list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `projects` subcommand supports this option:

| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |

    <Admonition type="tip">
    The Neon CLI provides a `neonctl connection-string` command you can use to extract a connection uri programmatically. See [Neon CLI commands â connection-string](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).
    </Admonition>

- Create a project with the `--output` format of the command set to `json`. This output format returns all of the project response data, whereas the default `table` output format (shown in the preceding example) is limited in the information it can display.

    ```bash
    neonctl projects create --output json

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-27T14:37:51.436Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `ip-allow` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about Neon's **IP Allow** feature, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## The `ip-allow` command

The `ip-allow` command allows you to perform `list`, `add`, `remove`, and `reset` actions on the IP allowlist for your Neon project. You can define an allowlist with individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation).

### Usage

```bash
neonctl ip-allow <subcommand> [options]
```

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List the IP allowlist    |
| [add](#add)  | Add IP addresses to the IP allowlist |
| [remove](#remove)  | Remove IP addresses from the IP allowlist |
| [reset](#reset)  | Reset the IP allowlist |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list addresses in the IP allowlist.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl ip-allow list [options]

| Option        | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |
| `--project-id`  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |

#### Examples

```bash
neonctl ip-allow list --project-id cold-grass-40154007
```

List the IP allowlist with the `--output` format set to `json`:

```bash
neonctl ip-allow list --project-id cold-grass-40154007 --output json
```

### add

This subcommand allows you to add IP addresses to the IP allowlist for your Neon project.

| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |
| `--project-id`  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| `--primary-branch`  | If true, the list will be applied only to the primary branch. Use `--primary-branch false` to remove this setting. | string | |

#### Example

```bash shouldWrap
neonctl ip-allow add 192.0.2.3 --project-id cold-grass-40154007
```

### remove

This subcommand allows you to remove IP addresses from the IP allowlist for your project.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl ip-allow remove [ips ...] [options]
```

## Before you begin

- Before running the `branches` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## The `branches` command

The `branches` command allows you to list, create, rename, delete, and retrieve information about branches in your Neon project. It also permits setting a branch as the primary branch and adding a compute endpoint to a branch. You can create a [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) by adding a read-only compute endpoint.

## Usage

```bash
neonctl branches <subcommand> [options]
```

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List branches    |
| [create](#create)  | Create a branch |
| [reset](#reset)   | Reset data to parent
| [restore](#restore) | Restore a branch to a selected point in time
| [rename](#rename)   | Rename a branch |
| [set-primary](#set-primary)   | Set a primary branch |
| [add-compute](#add-compute)   | Add replica to a branch |
| [delete](#delete)  | Delete a branch |
| [get](#get)     | Get a branch    |

## list

This subcommand allows you to list branches in a Neon project.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `list` subcommand supports these options:

| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |

    <Admonition type="tip">
    The Neon CLI provides a `neonctl connection-string` command you can use to extract a connection uri programmatically. See [Neon CLI commands â connection-string](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).
    </Admonition>

- Create a branch with the `--output` format of the command set to `json`. This output format returns all of the branch response data, whereas the default `table` output format (shown in the preceding example) is limited in the information it can display.

- Create a branch with a user-defined name:

    ```bash
    neonctl branches create --name mybranch
    ```

- Create a branch with a read-only compute endpoint (a [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas))

    ```bash
    neonctl branches create --name my_read_replica_branch --type read_only
    ```

- Create a branch from a parent branch other than your `main` branch

    ```bash
    neonctl branches create --name my_child_branch --parent mybranch
    ```

- Create a point-in-time restore branch by specifying the `--parent` option with a timestamp:

    ```bash
    neonctl branches create --name data_recovery --parent 2023-07-11T10:00:00Z
    ```

    The timestamp must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). For more information about point-in-time restore, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore (PITR)](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

- Create a branch and connect to it with `psql`.

    ```bash
    neonctl branch create --psql
    ```

- Create a branch, connect to it with `psql`, and run an `.sql` file. 

    ```bash
    neonctl branch create --psql -- -f dump.sql
    ```

- Create a branch, connect to it with `psql`, and run a query.

    ```bash
    neonctl branch create --psql -- -c "SELECT version()"
    ```

## reset

This command resets a child branch to the latest data from its parent.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent
```
`<id|name>` refers to the branch ID or branch name. You can use either one for this operation.

`--parent` specifies the type of reset operation. Currently, Neon only supports reset from parent. This parameter is required for the operation to work. In the future, Neon might add support for other reset types: for example, rewinding a branch to an earlier period in time.

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `reset` subcommand supports these options:

| Option        | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | :-----: |
| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |
| `--project-id`  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project or context is not set|
| `--parent`  | Reset to a parent branch  | boolean |  |
| `--preserve-under-name`  | The name under which to preserve the old branch | string |  |

#### Example

```bash
neonctl branches reset mybranch --parent

## restore

This command restores a branch to a specified point in time in its own or another branch's history.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches restore <target-id|name> <source>[@(timestamp|lsn)]
```

`<target-id|name>` specifies the ID or name of the branch that you want to restore.

`<source>` specifies the source branch you want to restore from. Options are:
- `^self` &#8212; restores the selected branch to an earlier point in its own history. You must select a timestamp or LSN for this option (restoring to head is not an option). You also need to include a name for the backup branch using the parameter `preserve-under-name`.
-  `^parent` &#8212; restores the target branch to its parent. By default the target is restored the latest (head) of its parent. Append `@timestamp` or `@lsn` to restore to an earlier point in the parent's history.
- `source branch ID` or `source branch name` &#8212; restores the target branch to the selected source branch. It restores the latest (head) by default. Append `@timestamp` or `@lsn` to restore to an earlier point in the source branch's history.

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI global options, the `restore` subcommand supports these options:

| Option                | Description                                                                   | Type   | Required |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|:--------:|
| `--context-file`      | Context file path and file name                                               | string |          |
| `--project-id`        | Project ID                                                                    | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project or context is not set |
| `--preserve-under-name` | Name for the backup created during restore.                                   | string |  When restoring to `^self`    |

#### Examples

Examples of the different kinds of restore operations you can do:

- [Restoring a branch to an earlier point in its history](#restoring-a-branch-to-an-earlier-point-in-its-own-history-with-backup)
- [Restoring to another branch's head](#restoring-a-branch-target-to-the-head-of-another-branch-source)
- [Restoring a branch to its parent](#restoring-a-branch-to-its-parent-at-an-earlier-point-in-time)

#### Restoring a branch to an earlier point in its own history (with backup)

This command restores the branch `dev/alex` to an earlier timestamp, saving to a backup branch called `restore_backup_2024-02-20`

```bash shouldWrap
neonctl branches restore dev/alex ^self@2024-02-21T10:00:00.000Z --preserve-under-name restore_backup_2024-02-20
```

Results of the operation:

```bash shouldWrap

## Before you begin

- Before running the `databases` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about databases in Neon, see [Manage databases](/docs/manage/databases).

## The `databases` command

### Usage

The `databases` command allows you to list, create, and delete databases in a Neon project.

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List databases    |
| [create](#create)  | Create a database |
| [delete](#delete)  | Delete a database |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list databases.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl databases list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `list` subcommand supports these options:

| Option        | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |
| `--project-id`  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| `--branch`   | Branch ID or name   | string |  |

If a branch ID or name is not provided, the command lists databases for the primary branch of the project.

#### Example

```bash shouldWrap
neonctl databases list --branch br-autumn-dust-190886
ââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââ

subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-02-08T15:20:54.296Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `connection-string` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## The `connection-string` command

This command gets a Postgres connection string for connecting to a database in your Neon project. You can construct a connection string for any database in any branch. The connection string includes the password for the specified role.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl connection-string [branch] [options]
```

`branch` specifies the branch name or id. If a branch name or ID is ommited, the primary branch is used.

### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `connection-string` command supports these options:

| Option        | Description  | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------ | :------: |
| `--context-file` | [Context file](/docs/reference/cli-set-context#using-a-named-context-file) path and file name | string | |
| `--project-id`  | Project ID   | string |  Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| `--role-name`   | Role name    | string | Only if your branch has more than one role |
| `--database-name` | Database name| string | Only if your branch has more than one database |
| `--pooled` | Construct a pooled connection. The default is `false`. |boolean||
| `--prisma` | Construct a connection string for use with Prisma. The default is `false`. |boolean||
| `--endpoint-type` | The compute endpoint type. The default is `read-write`. The choise are `read_only` and `read_write`` |string||
| `--extended` | Show extended information. The default is `false`. |boolean||
| `--psql` | Connect to a database via psql using connection string. `psql` must be installed to use this option. |boolean||

### Examples

- Get a basic connection string for the current project, branch, and database:

    ```bash shouldWrap
    neonctl connection-string mybranch
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

- Get a pooled connection string for the current project, branch, and database with the `--pooled` option. This option adds a `-pooler` flag to the host name which enables connection pooling for clients that use this connection string.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    neonctl connection-string --pooled
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

- Get a connection string for use with Prisma for the current project, branch, and database. The `--prisma` options adds `connect_timeout=30` option to the connection string to ensure that connections from Prisma Client do not timeout.

    ```bash shouldWrap
    neonctl connection-string --prisma
   postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?connect_timeout=30
    ```

- Get a connection string and connect with `psql`.

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string --psql
    ```

- Get a connection string, connect with `psql`, and run an `.sql` file.

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string --psql -- -f dump.sql
    ```

- Get a connection string, connect with `psql`, and run a query.

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string --psql -- -c "SELECT version()"
    ```

title: Neon CLI commands â set-context
subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2024-01-10T17:27:58.305Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `set-context` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#install-the-neon-cli).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## The `set-context` command

This command sets a background context for your CLI sessions, letting you perform project or branch-specific actions without having to specify the project or branch id in every command. Using the `context-file` parameter, you can save the context to a file of your choice. If you don't specify a file, a default `.neon` file is saved to the current directory. You can switch contexts by providing different files.

The context remains in place until you reset to a new context or remove the `context-file`.

### Usage

#### set-context (hidden file)

```bash
neonctl set-context [option]
```
#### set-context to context-file

```bash
neonctl set-context [option] --context-file <your_context_file>
```

#### set-context during project creation

You can also set context for a new project during project creation.

```bash
neonctl projects create --name <project_name> --set-context <your_context_file>
```

### Options

The `set-context` command requires you set at least one of these options:

| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--project-id` | Project ID    | string | Sets the identified project as the context until you reset or remove context-file |
| `--branch` | Branch ID or name | string | Sets the identified branch as the context until you reset or remove context-file |
| `--context-file` | path and file name | string | Creates a file that holds project-id and branch context 

[Global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options) are also supported.

## Examples of setting and using a context

Here are some examples of setting contexts to specific projects, then using them in an example command.

### Using the default file

Set the context to the default `.neon` file:

```bash
neonctl set-context --project-id patient-frost-50125040
```

List all branches for this project using `branches list`. You do not need to include `--project-id` even though multiple projects exist for this account:

```bash
neonctl branches list
```
The results show details for all branches in the `patient-frost-50125040` project:

### Using a named `context-file`

Set the context to the `context-file` of your choice:

```bash
neonctl set-context --project-id plain-waterfall-84865553 --context-file Documents/MyContext
```

List all branches using the `branches list` command. No need to specify the project since the context-file provides it.

```bash
neonctl branches list --context-file Documents/MyContext

```

<Admonition type="note">
These two `branches list` commands demonstrate the use of different contexts in the same account. The default `.neon` context is set to `patient-frost-50125040` while the named `context-file` is set to `plain-waterfall-84865553`. These contexts operate independently. You can set as many `context-files` as you'd like, using unique names or in different directories, depending on your needs.
</Admonition>

### Setting context when creating a new project

Let's say you want to create a new project called `MyLatest`. You can automatically set the project ID and primary branch ID  context at the same time as you create the project.

```bash
neonctl projects create --name MyLatest --set-context
```

This creates a hidden file with the following context details:

```json
{
  "projectId": "quiet-water-76237589",
  "branchId": "br-still-wind-46531853"
}
```
You can now use any command that would normally require an additional `--project-id` or `branch` parameter and the command will default to this context.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon does not save any confidential information to the context file (for example, auth tokens). You can safely commit this file to your repository or share with others.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-01T22:29:21.618Z'
---

## Before you begin

Before running the `completion` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).

## The `completion` command

This command generates a completion script for the `neonctl` command-line interface (CLI). The completion script, when installed, helps you type `neonctl` commands faster and more accurately. It does this by presenting the possible commands and options when you press the **tab** key after typing or partially typing a command or option.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl completion
```

The command outputs a completion script similar to the one shown below.

<Admonition type="important">
Use the completion script that is output to your terminal or command window, as the script may differ depending on your operating environment.
</Admonition>

```text
###-begin-neonctl-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: neonctl completion >> ~/.bashrc
#    or neonctl completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
#
_neonctl_yargs_completions()
{
    local cur_word args type_list

    cur_word="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
    args=("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")

    # ask yargs to generate completions.
    type_list=$(neonctl --get-yargs-completions "${args[@]}")

    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${type_list}" -- ${cur_word}) )

    # if no match was found, fall back to filename completion
    if [ ${#COMPREPLY[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
      COMPREPLY=()
    fi

    return 0
}
complete -o bashdefault -o default -F _neonctl_yargs_completions neonctl
###-end-neonctl-completions-###
```

Use the commands provided below to add the completion script to your shell configuration file, which is typically found in your `home` directory. Your shell configuration file may differ by platform. For example, on Ubuntu, you should have a `.bashrc` file, and on macOS, you might have `bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file. The `source` command causes the changes to take effect immediately in the current shell session.

Neon provides support for the [@neondatabase/api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) library, which is a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). It provides a convenient way to interact with the Neon API using TypeScript.

## Installation

You can install the library using `npm` or `yarn`.

`npm`:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

`yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @neondatabase/api-client
```

## Get Started

To get started with the `@neondatabase/api-client` library, follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API key from the [Developer Settings](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) page in the Neon Console.

2. Click **Generate new API key**.

3. Enter name for your API key and click **Create**.

4. Save your API key to a secure location that enables you to pass it to your code.

5. Import the library:

   ```typescript
   import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';
   ```

6. Create an instance of the API client by calling the `createApiClient` function:

    ```typescript
    const apiClient = createApiClient({
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    });
    ```

7. Use the `apiClient` instance to make API calls. For example:

    ```typescript
    const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
    console.log(response);
    ```

## Community SDKs

The following is a list of community-created SDKs for interacting with the Neon API.

<Admonition type="note">
Community SDKs are not maintained or officially supported by Neon. Some features may be out of date, so use these SDKs at your own discretion. If you have questions about these SDKs, please contact the the project maintainers.

## Access token

See [Token](#token).

## Active hours

A usage metric that tracks the amount of time a compute is active, rather than idle when suspended due to inactivity. The time that your compute is idle is not counted toward compute usage.

## Activity Monitor

A process that monitors a Neon compute instance for activity. During periods of inactivity, the Activity Monitor gracefully places the compute into an `Idle` state to save energy and resources. The Activity Monitor closes idle connections after 5 minutes of inactivity. When a connection is made to an idle compute, the Activity Monitor reactivates the compute.

## API

See [Neon API](#neon-api).

A unique identifier used to authenticate a user or a calling program to an API. An API key is required to authenticate to the Neon API. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## apply_config

A Neon Control Plane operation that applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating Postgres users and databases initiates this operation. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Autosuspend compute

A feature that suspends a compute endpoint after a specified period of inactivity (5 minutes, by default) to save on compute resources. This feature is also referred to as "scale to zero". When suspended, a compute endpoint is placed into an `Idle` state. Otherwise, the compute endpoint is in an `Active` state. Users on paid plans can configure the _Autosuspend_ feature. For example, you can increase the delay period to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable autosuspend completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. For more information, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

## autoscaler-agent

A control mechanism in the Neon autoscaling system that collects metrics from VMs, makes scaling decisions, and performs checks and requests to implement those decisions.

## Autoscaling

A feature that automatically adjusts the allocation of vCPU and RAM for compute endpoints within specified minimum and maximum compute size boundaries, optimizing for performance and cost-efficiency. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Availability Checker

A periodic load generated by the Control Plane to determine if a compute can start and read and write data. The Availability Checker queries a system database without accessing user data.

## Backpressure

A mechanism that manages the lag between the Pageserver and compute node or the Pageserver and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) service. If the WAL service runs ahead of the Pageserver, the time to serve page requests increases, which could result in increased query times or timeout errors. The backpressure mechanism manages lag using a stop-and-wait backend throttling strategy.

## Branch

A [copy-on-write](#copy-on-write) clone of a Neon project's primary branch or previously created child branch. A branch can be created from the current or past state of the parent branch. A branch created from the current state of the parent branch includes the databases and roles that existed in the parent branch at the time of branch creation. A branch created from a past state of the parent branch includes the databases and roles that existed in the past state. The data in a branch can be modified independently from its originating data. See [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching). Connecting to a database in a branch requires connecting via the branch's compute endpoint. For more information, see [Connect to a branch](/docs/manage/branches#connect-to-a-branch).

## Branching

A Neon feature that allows you to create a copy-on-write clone (a "branch") of your project data. See [Branch](#branch).

## check_availability

A Neon Control Plane operation that checks the availability of data in a branch and that a compute endpoint can start on a branch. Branches without a compute endpoint are not checked. This operation, performed by the availability checker, is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## CI/CD

Continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

## CIDR notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method used to define ranges of IP addresses in network management. It is presented in the format of an IP address, followed by a slash, and then a number (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24). The number after the slash represents the size of the address block, providing a compact way to specify a large range of IP addresses. In Neon's IP Allow feature, CIDR notation allows for efficiently specifying a block of IP addresses, especially useful for larger networks or subnets. This can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network. For related information, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## cgroups

Control groups, a Linux kernel feature that allows the organization, prioritization, and accounting of system resources for groups of processes.

## Compute

A service that provides virtualized computing resources (CPU, memory, and storage) for running applications. A Neon compute instance (also referred to as a [compute endpoint](#compute-endpoint)) runs Postgres. The amount of compute resources available to a Neon project is defined by tier. Neon supports free and paid tiers.

## Compute endpoint

A Neon compute instance. Neon creates a single read-write compute endpoint for the project's primary branch. Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints. You can choose whether or not to create a compute endpoint when creating child branches. The compute endpoint hostname is required to connect to a Neon database from a client or application. A compute endpoint hostname can be found in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or by selecting the branch on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute endpoint hostname starts with an `ep-` prefix, as in this example: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`. A compute endpoint hostname includes an `endpoint_id` (`ep-cool-darkness-123456`), a region slug (`us-east-2`), the cloud platform (`aws`), and Neon domain (`neon.tech`). For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app). For more information about compute endpoints, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints/).

## Connection pooling

A method of creating a pool of connections and caching those connections for reuse. Neon supports `PgBouncer` inÂ `transaction mode` for connection pooling. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

## Connection string

A string containing details for connecting to a Neon database. The details include a user name (role), compute endpoint hostname, and database name; for example:

```bash shouldWrap
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

The compute endpoint hostname includes an `endpoint_id` (`ep-cool-darkness-123456`), a region slug (`us-east-2`), the cloud platform (`aws`), and Neon domain (`neon.tech`).

Connection strings for a Neon databases can be obtained from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Compute size

The number of Compute Units (CU) assigned to a Neon compute. One CU is defined as having 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute.

## Compute Unit (CU)

A unit that measures the processing power of a Neon compute. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs.

## Compute hour

A usage metric for tracking compute usage. 1 compute hour is equal to one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. If you have a compute with .25 vCPU, as you would on the Neon Free Tier, it would require 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if you have a compute with 4 vCPU, it would only take 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.

To calculate compute hour usage, you would use the following formula:

```
compute hours = active hours x compute size
```

For more information, see [Compute](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#compute).

## Console

See [Neon Console](#neon-console).

## Control Plane

The part of the Neon architecture that manages cloud storage and compute resources.

## Copy-on-write

A technique used to copy data efficiently. Neon uses the copy-on-write technique to copy data when creating a branch.

## create_branch

A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a branch in a Neon project. For related information, see Manage branches. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## create_timeline

A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a project with a primary branch. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Data-at-rest encryption

A method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in [NVMe SSD volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes). The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.

## Data transfer

A usage metric that measures the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (known as "egress") during a given billing period.

## Database

A named collection of database objects. A Neon project has a ready-to-use database named `neondb` which resides in the default `public` schema. A Neon project can contain multiple databases. Users cannot manipulate system databases, such as the `postgres`, `template0`, or `template1` databases.

## Database branching

See [Branching](#branching).

## Database fleet

A collection of database instances, typically managed as a single entity.

## Decoder plugin

Utilized in PostgreSQL replication architecture to decode WAL entries into a format understandable by the subscriber. The `pgoutput` decoder plugin is the default decoder, with alternatives like `wal2json` for specific use cases. Neon supports `pgoutput` and `wal2json`. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## Dedicated resources

Resources including compute and storage dedicated to a single Neon account.

## delete_tenant

A Neon Control Plane operation that deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Egress

The data transferred out of the Neon service to an external destination.

## Enterprise plan

A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Free Tier

See [Neon Free Tier](#neon-free-tier).

## History

The history of data changes for all branches in your Neon project. A history is maintained to support _point-in-time restore_. For more information, see [Storage details](/docs/introduction/usahe-metrics#storage-details).

## IP allowlist

An IP allowlist is a security measure used in network and database management. It specifies a list of IP addresses that are permitted to access a certain resource. Any IP address not on the list is automatically blocked, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can gain access. In Neon, **IP Allow** is a Scale plan feature that can be used to control access to the branch where your database resides. The allowlist can be applied to all branches (the default) or the [primary branch](#primary-branch) only. For more information, see [Configure the IP Allow list](/docs/manage/projects#configure-tip-allow).

## Kubernetes

An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes cluster

A set of interconnected nodes that run containerized applications and services using Kubernetes, an open-source orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The cluster consists of at least one control plane node, which manages the overall state of the cluster, and multiple worker nodes, where the actual application containers are deployed and executed. The worker nodes communicate with the control plane node to ensure the desired state of the applications is maintained.

## Kubernetes node

A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which runs containerized applications.

## Kubernetes scheduler

A component of Kubernetes that assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

## KVM

Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a virtualization infrastructure built into the Linux kernel that allows it to act as a hypervisor for virtual machines.

## Live migration

A feature provided by some hypervisors, such as QEMU, that allows the transfer of a running virtual machine from one host to another with minimal interruption.

## Local File Cache

A layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data from the storage layer in the local memory of the compute instance. This cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the storage layer repeatedly.

### Logical data size

For a Postgres database, it is the size of the database, including all tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures. In Neon, a branch can have multiple databases. The logical data size for a branch is therefore equal to the total logical size of all databases on the branch.

## Logical replication

A method of replicating data between databases or platforms, focusing on replicating transactional changes (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) rather than the entire database, enabling selective replication of specific tables or rows. Neon supports logical replication of data to external destinations. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

## LSN

Log Sequence Number. A byte offset to a location in the [WAL stream](#wal-stream). The Neon branching feature supports creating branches with data up to a specified LSN.

## LRU policy

Least Recently Used policy, an algorithm for cache replacement that evicts the least recently accessed items first.

## Neon

A fully managed serverless Postgres. Neon separates storage and compute to offer modern developer features such as branching, autoscaling, and bottomless storage. For more information, see [What is Neon?](/docs/introduction/about/).

## Neon API

The Neon RESTful Application Programming Interface. Any operation performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API.

## Neon Console

A browser-based graphical interface for managing Neon projects and resources.

## Neon Free Tier

A Neon service tier for which there are no usage charges. For information about the Neon Free Tier and associated limits, see [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier).

## Neon user

The user account that registers and authenticates with Neon using an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account. After authenticating, a Neon user account can create and manage projects, branches, users, databases, and other project resources.

## NeonVM

A QEMU-based tool used by Neon to create and manage VMs within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing for the allocation and deallocation of vCPU and RAM. For more information, refer to the NeonVM source in the [neondatabase/autoscaling](https://github.com/neondatabase/autoscaling/tree/main/neonvm) repository.

## Non-primary branch

Any branch not designated as the [primary branch](#primary-branch) is considered a non-primary branch. For more information, see [Non-primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch).

## Page

An 8KB unit of data, which is the smallest unit that Postgres uses for storing relations and indexes on disk. In Neon, a page is also the smallest unit of data that resides on a Pageserver. For information about Postgres page format, see [Database Page Layout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/storage-page-layout.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

## Paid plan

 A paid Neon service tier. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Pageserver

A Neon architecture component that reads WAL records from Safekeepers to identify modified pages. The Pageserver accumulates and indexes incoming WAL records in memory and writes them to disk in batches. Each batch is written to an immutable file that is never modified after creation. Using these files, the Pageserver can quickly reconstruct any version of a page dating back to the defined history retention period. Neon retains a history for all branches.

The Pageserver uploads immutable files to cloud storage, which is the final, highly durable destination for data. After a file is successfully uploaded to cloud storage, the corresponding WAL records can be removed from the Safekeepers.

## Passwordless authentication

The ability to authenticate without providing a password. Neonâs [Passwordless auth](#passwordless-auth) feature supports passwordless authentication.

## Platform Partnership plan

A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon that includes support for resale. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Point-in-time restore

Restoration of data to a state that existed at an earlier time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records, which allows you to restore data to an earlier time. A point-in-time restore is performed by creating a branch using the **Time** or **LSN** option. By default, Neon retains a history of changes for all branches in a project. The supported limits are 24 hours for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/plans#free-tier) users, 7 days for [Launch](/docs/introduction/plans#launch) plan users, and 30 days for [Scale](/docs/introduction/plans#scale) plan users. For more information about this feature, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

## pooled connection string

A pooled connection string in Neon includes a `-pooler` option, which directs your connection to a pooled connection port at the Neon Proxy. This is an example of a pooled connection:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

A pooled connection can support a high number of concurrent users and is recommended for use with serverless and edge functions. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

You can obtain a pooled connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon Dashboard. Select the **Pooled connection** option to add the `-pooler` option to the connection string. For further instructions, see [Enable connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#enable-connection-pooling).

## PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

## Postgres role

A Postgres role named for the registered Neon account is created with each Neon project. This role and any additional role created in the Neon Console, API, or CLI is assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, sequences. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic [public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the `neon_superuser` role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

Older projects may have a `web-access` system role, used by the [SQL Editor](#sql-editor) and Neonâs [Passwordless auth](#passwordless-auth). The `web-access` role is system-managed. It cannot be modified, removed, or used in other authentication scenarios.

## Primary branch

Each Neon project is created with a root branch called `main`, which is designated as your project's primary branch by default. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch. For more information, see [Primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch).

## Project

A collection of branches, databases, roles, and other project resources and settings. A project contains a compute with a Postgres server and storage for the project data.

## Project sharing

A feature that allows you to share Neon projects with other Neon users. See [Share a project](/docs/manage/projects#share-a-project) for more information.

## Project storage

The total volume of data stored in your Neon project. Also, a billing metric that measures the total volume of data and history, in GiB-hours, stored in your Neon project. See [Storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).

## Proxy

A Neon component that functions as a multitenant service that accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol.

## Publisher

In the context of logical replication, the publisher is the primary data source where changes occur. It's responsible for sending those changes to one or more subscribers. A Neon database can act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

## QEMU

A free and open-source emulator and virtualizer that performs hardware virtualization.

## RAM

Random Access Memory, a type of computer memory used to store data that is being actively processed.

## Region

The geographic location where Neon project resources are located. Neon supports creating projects in several Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions. For information about regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

## Replication slot

On the publisher database in a logical replication setup, replication slots track the progress of replication to ensure no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it, thus preventing data loss or inconsistency. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## Resale

Selling the Neon service as part of another service offering. Neon's Platform Partnership plan offers resale of the Neon service as an option. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans) for more information.

## Root branch

Each Neon project is created with a root branch called `main`, which cannot be deleted. This branch is designated as your project's [primary branch](#primary-branch) by default, but you can change your primary branch. You can change the name of your root branch, but you cannot designate another branch as your root branch. The root branch created with your project always remains your project's root branch.

## Safekeeper

A Neon architecture component responsible for the durability of database changes. Postgres streams WAL records to Safekeepers. A quorum algorithm based on Paxos ensures that when a transaction is committed, it is stored on a majority of Safekeepers and can be recovered if a node is lost. Safekeepers are deployed in different availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.

## Scale-to-zero

Scale-to-zero refers to Neon's Autosuspend feature, which places a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state when it is not being used. Neon suspends a compute after five minutes of inactivity, by default. See [Autosuspend compute](#autosuspend-compute).

## Serverless

A cloud-based development model that enables developing and running applications without having to manage servers.

## SNI

Server Name Indication. A TLS protocol extension that allows a client or browser to indicate which hostname it wants to connect to at the beginning of a TLS handshake.

## SQL Editor

A feature of the Neon Console that enables running queries on a Neon database. The SQL Editor also enables saving queries, viewing query history, and analyzing or explaining queries.

## start_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that starts a compute endpoint when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute endpoint initiates this operation. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## Storage

Where data is recorded and stored. Neon storage consists of Pageservers, which store hot data, and a cloud object store, such as Amazon S3, that stores cold data for cost optimization and durability.

Also, a usage metric that tracks the total volume of data and [history](#history) stored in Neon. For more information, see [Storage](/docs/introduction/usage-metrics#storage).

## Subscriber

The database or platform receiving changes from the publisher in a logical replication setup. It applies changes received from the publisher to its own data set. Currently, a Neon database can only act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

## Subscription

Represents the downstream side of logical replication, establishing a connection to the publisher and subscribing to one or more publications to receive updates. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## suspend_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## Technical Preview

Neon is currently in Technical Preview, meaning that some intended core functionalities are still being developed or perfected. Please refer to the [Neon roadmap](/docs/introduction/roadmap) for more information.

## Token

An encrypted access token that enables you to authenticate with Neon using the Neon API. An access token is generated when creating a Neon API key. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## tmpfs

A temporary file storage system that uses a portion of a system's RAM to store files, improving performance by reducing disk usage.

## unpooled connection string

An unpooled connection string connects to your Neon database directly. It does not use [connection pooling](#connection-pooling), and it looks similar to this:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

You can obtain an unpooled connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon Dashboard. Ensure that the **Pooled connection** option is **not** selected. A direct connection is subject to the `max_connections` limit for your compute. For more information, see [How to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute).

## User

See [Neon user](#neon-user) and [Postgres role](#postgresql-role).

## vm-informant

A program that runs inside the VM alongside Postgres, responsible for requesting more resources from the autoscaler-agent and validating proposed downscaling to ensure sufficient memory.

## vCPU

Virtual CPU, a unit of processing power allocated to a virtual machine or compute instance.

## WAL

See [Write-Ahead Logging](#write-ahead-logging-wal).

## WAL receiver

In logical replication, on the subscriber side, the WAL receiver is a process that receives the replication stream (decoded WAL data) and applies these changes to the subscriber's database. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL sender

In logical replication, the WAL sender is a process on the publisher database that reads the WAL and sends relevant data to the subscriber. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL slice

Write-ahead logs in a specific LSN range.

## WAL stream

The stream of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during transactional processing.

## Working set

A subset of frequently accessed or recently used data and indexes that ideally reside in memory (RAM) for quick access, allowing for better performance. See [how to size your compute](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute) to learn how to set your minimum compute to an adequate size to handle your working set.

## Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

A standard mechanism that ensures the durability of your data. Neon relies on WAL to separate storage and compute, and to support features such as branching and point-in-time restore.

In logical replication, the WAL records all changes to the data, serving as the source for data that needs to be replicated.

## Written data

A usage metric that measures the total volume of data written from compute to storage within a given billing period, measured in gigibytes (GiB). Writing data from compute to storage ensures the durability and integrity of your data.

The Neon documentation file structure reflects the navigation you see on the website. However, the order of the directories under `/content/docs/` is alphabetical.

```text
âââ content
   âââ docs
       âââ ai
       âââ community
       âââ connect
       âââ extensions
       âââ get-started-with-neon
       âââ guides
       âââ introduction
       âââ manage
       âââ reference
       âââ security
       âââ serverless
```

- Every Markdown file in the `/docs` folder becomes a documentation page unless it's defined with an `isDraft: true` property in the page [frontmatter](#markdown-frontmatter).
- Folder and file names should use [kebab-case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case) (hyphens between words).

## Documentation table of contents

This section describes how to modify the documentation table of contents, also referred to as the "sidebar". Adding, removing, or moving a page in the documentation requires updating the sidebar. The sidebar is defined in a `yaml` file, conveniently named `sidebar.yaml`, which you can find at the root of the `/docs` directory.

### Add a new category

To add a new category to the sidebar, add a new item to the top-level array with `title` and `items` key values, as shown below:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
+- title: Category 2
+  items:
+    - title: Page 2
+      slug: page-2
```

### Add a new page

To add new page, add a new item to the `items` array with the `title` and `slug` keys under the category or subcategory.

```diff yaml
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
    - title: Subcategory 1
      items:
        - title: Page 3
          slug: page-3
+       - title: Page 4
+         slug: page-4
    - title: Page 5
      slug: page-5
```

- The `title` in the sidebar may differ from `title` in the Markdown file. For example, your sidebar title might be a shorter version of the title in your Markdown file. This lets you write longer, more informative page titles while keeping the sidebar titles short, readable, and easy to scan. These titles should remain logically related. For example, in our docs we reduce the page title "Use Grafbase Edge Resolvers with Neon" to just "Grafbase" in the sidebar.
- `slug` should always exactly match the page's slug (the last part of the URL after the final backslash "/", in our case the name of the Markdown file).

## Markdown frontmatter

Each Neon documentation Markdown file includes a frontmatter section at the beginning of the file containing file metadata. The frontmatter section is distinguished by three dashes, as shown here:

```yaml
---
tile: Page Title
enableTableOfContents: true
---
```

The only required attribute is `title`, which becomes the page title that appears on the page and the browser tab.

### Frontmatter attributes

Frontmatter attributes include:

Attribute | Description
----- | ---
subtitle |  A secondary title or description that appears on the page, under the main title.
enableTableOfContents | A boolean flag (i.e., true or false) that tells the static site generator whether or not to generate a right-hand table of contents for the page. We recommend adding this option if your page has more than a few sections.
isDraft | Adding this attribute and setting it to `true` prevents the page from becoming a documentation page and being searchable. Include this option to avoid publishing the content before its ready.
redirectFrom | A list of directory paths that should redirect to this file. This is useful if the page has moved and you want old URLs to continue working.
updatedOn | This attribute is added automatically. You do not need to add it.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: Connect a Next.js application to Neon
subtitle: Set up a Neon project and connect from a Next.js application
enableTableOfContents: true
redirectFrom:
  - /docs/content/<old_directory_name>
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T12:25:27.662Z'
---
```

## Heading levels

The page title in the frontmatter is translated into an `h1` element when the page is converted to HTML.

Top-level section headings in the body of your document are defined with two hash characters, which is equivalent to an `h2` heading:

```md
## Section heading
```

To add a subsection heading, equivalent to an `h3`, add another `#` character:

```md
### Subsection heading
```

- Try to avoid heading levels beyond h4 (`####`).
- Do not skip a level, e.g., do not go from `##` to `####`.
- Ensure there's a blank line before and after each heading.

## Common markup

```md
External link markup: [Example.com website](https://www.example.com/)
Neon documentation page link: [Connection from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app)
Neon documentation same page link: [Code blocks](#code-blocks)
Italics markup: _italic_
Bold markup: **strong**
monospace: `backtick`
```

## Code blocks

To insert a code block into your Markdown file, specify three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code. Specify the language identifier to enable code highlighting, as in this example:

````md
```sql
SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id;
```
````

You can add language-specific highlighting to code blocks, as in the example above. See [Supported language highlighting for code blocks](https://shiki.matsu.io/languages).

Code block accepts the following options:

- `showLineNumbers`: Shows the line numbers in the code block
- `shouldWrap`: Enables code wrapping in the code block. This is useful for long commands or connection strings that would otherwise require the reader to scroll.

Example:

````md

```bash shouldWrap
A really long line that scrolls off the page
```

````

## Code tabs

To display code tabs, enclose all pieces of code within `<CodeTabs></CodeTabs>` and specify labels in order, as shown in the following example:

````md
<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js"]}>

  ```shell
  npm install pg
  ```

  ```shell
  npm install postgres
  ```

</CodeTabs>
````

To view this example in the Neon documentation, see [Create a Next.js project and add dependencies](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/nextjs#create-a-nextjs-project-and-add-dependencies).

## Admonitions

The Neon documentation supports the following admonitions:

- Note
- Important
- Tip
- Warning
- Info

To use an admonition, enclose your text with `<Admonition></Admonition>` and specify the admonition type: `note`, `important`, `tip`, `warning`, and `info`. The default is `note`.

```md
<Admonition type="note">
This is an important note
</Admonition>
```

You can specify a title with the `title` property.

```md
<Admonition type="note" title="Very important note">
This is a very important note.
</Admonition>
```

Example output:

<Admonition type="note" title="Very important note">
This is a very important note.
</Admonition>

## Diagrams and screen captures

Neon uses Figma to create diagrams.

If you're interested in updating or adding a diagram, please open a GitHub issue with your suggestions. Please include a draft, if possible. You can use a tool like [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) to create a draft.

If possible, please take screen captures on a high resolution monitor (UHD/4K). Screen captures should be unaltered (no borders or special effects).

Diagrams and images are stored in the `/public/docs` directory in the Neon website repository. The directory location of the diagram or image under `public` mirrors the location of the file that includes the diagram or image, as shown below:

Example file structure:

```md
âââ content
â âââ docs
â   âââ introduction
â     âââ architecture-overview.md


âââ public
â âââ docs
â   âââ introduction
â     âââ neon_architecture.png // put images in the public directory with the same name
```

To add an image to your Markdown file, add an entry that looks like this:

```md
![Neon architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/neon_architecture.png)
```

## Style Guide

This section outlines the stylistic elements that we do our best to follow in the Neon documentation.

### Voice and language

The voice in the documentation should sound like one human being explaining something to another, while striking the right balance between being approachable and professional.

#### Guidelines

1. **Use contractions**:
    - **Do**: Use contractions like "it's", "don't", "you're" to make the tone more conversational.
      - *Example*: "It's essential to save your progress."
    - **Don't**: Overuse contractions, which can compromise clarity.

2. **Simplicity over jargon**:
    - **Do**: Choose simpler words when possible.
      - *Example*: "Use the tool," not "Utilize the instrument."
    - **Don't**: Oversimplify to the point of being inaccurate or leaving out useful context.

3. **Active voice**:
    - **Do**: Prefer active voice.
      - *Example*: "The software converts the file."
    - **Don't**: Over-rely on passive voice.
      - *Example*: "The file is converted by the software."

4. **Brief sentences**:
    - **Do**: Keep sentences concise.
      - *Example*: "Check the settings."

5. **Personalize when relevant**:
    - **Do**: Use "you" to address the reader.
      - *Example*: "You can adjust the setting."
    - **Don't**: Overdo direct addresses. Not every sentence should start with "You".

6. **Consistent terminology**:
    - **Do**: Stick to one term for one concept.
      - *Example*: Always use "dashboard". Don't mix that term with "control panel".
    - **Don't**: Confuse with synonyms.
      - *Example*: Switching between "log-in", "sign-in", and "access point".

7. **Examples for clarity**:
    - **Do**: Provide clear examples.
      - *Example*: "For instance, to upload a file, click on the 'Upload' button."

8. **Use US English**:
    - **Do**: Adhere to US English spelling and grammar rules.

9. **Avoid emojis and exclamations**:
    - **Don't**: Use emojis or exclamation marks in the documentation.

### Link instead of repeating text

Avoid repeating or duplicating information from other topics. Instead, link to the original source of information and explain why it is important.

### Capitalization

Use lowercase wherever possible.

For topic titles, use sentence-style capitalization. For example: "Create your first project"

Product names should align with the official names of the products, protocols, etc., maintaining exact capitalization.

#### UI text

When referencing specific user interface text, such as button labels or menu items, use the same capitalization displayed in the user interface wherever possible.

#### Feature names

Generally, feature names should be lowercase.

#### Other terms

Capitalize names of:

- Neon tiers and plans. For example, "Neon Free Tier".
- Third-party organizations, software, and products. Kubernetes, Git, and Vercel.
- Methods or methodologies. Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, etc.

Follow the capitalization style used by the authoritative source, which may use non-standard case styles. For example: PostgreSQL, GitHub, npm.

### Fake user information

When including user information in connection details, API calls, or UI instructions, don't use real user information or email addresses.

- Use an email address ending in `@example.com` or `domain.com`.
- Use strings like `example_username` or one of the following diverse and non-gendered names: Zhang Kai, Alex Lopez, or Dana Smith.

### Connection strings

Connection strings should be defined as follows:

```text
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

If you need to provide a connection string with realistic values, use one of the user names mentioned above, `AbC123dEf` for the password, and `dbname` for the database name:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

### Commands, parameters, values, filenames

Commands, parameters, values, filenames, error messages, connection strings, and other similar items should be enclosed in backticks. For example:

- "Run the `neonctl projects list` command."

- "Execute `git clone` to clone a Git repository..."

- `git clone` is a command that should be in lowercase, whereas Git is the product and should have a capital G.

- "A connection string has this format: `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]`"
