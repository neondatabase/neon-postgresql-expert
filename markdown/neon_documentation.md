Neon is a fully managed serverless Postgres with a generous free tier.
Neon separates storage and compute and offers modern developer features such as serverless, branching, bottomless storage, and more. Neon is open source and written in Rust.

## Serverless

Neon automatically and transparently scales up compute on demand, in response to application workload. Neon also scales down to zero on inactivity. Since Neon is serverless, it only charges for what you use and can deliver up to a 10x reduction in cost. To learn more, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling), and [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).

## Built for developer productivity

Neon allows you to create a branch of your Postgres database. It's easy to create branches for development, test, and staging environments.

Branching is instant and has close to zero overhead, as it is implemented using the "copy-on-write" technique in Neon storage.
In fact, branches are so cheap that you can create a branch for every code deployment in your CI/CD pipeline. To learn more about our branching feature, see [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching).

## Fully managed

Neon provides high availability without any administrative, maintenance, or scaling burden.

## Bottomless storage

Our engineering team has developed a purpose-built, multi-tenant storage system for the cloud.
Neon storage allows virtually unlimited storage while providing high availability and durability guarantees.

Neon storage integrates storage, backups, and archiving into one system. This reduces operational headaches associated with checkpoints, data backups, and restore.

Neon storage is designed with cloud costs in mind and uses a multi-tier architecture to deliver on latency, throughput, and cost. It integrates a cloud object store, such as S3, to push cold data to the cheapest storage medium, and uses locally attached SSDs for low latency, high-performance data. Neon storage is written in Rust for maximum performance and usability.

## Open source

You can find [neondatabase](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) on GitHub. We develop in public under the Apache 2.0 license. For an overview of Neon's architecture, refer to Neon's [architecture documentation](/docs/introduction/architecture-overview).

## Compatibility

Neon compute is the latest version of Postgres. It is 100% compatible with any application that uses the official release of Postgres. Currently, we support [Postgres 14](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14.html), [Postgres 15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15.html) (the default), and [Postgres 16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html). For details refer to the [Postgres compatibility](/docs/reference/compatibility) page.

The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February, 2022, and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the [Technical Preview](#technical-preview), making Neon available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Neon's [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

On March 15th, 2023, Neon launched paid plans, providing increased limits and added features, including _Project sharing_ and _Autoscaling_. For information about Neon's paid  plans, refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

Support for more regions and additional features will be released in the coming months.

## Technical Preview

Neon sets a high standard for what constitutes a feature-complete product, meaning that all intended core functionality is implemented and operates as expected. While many features may be operational today, there may still be some that are under development or refinement. Neon will remain in Technical Preview while the remaining features are still being developed and perfected.

Neon architecture is based on the separation of compute and storage and is orchestrated by the Neon Control Plane, which manages cloud resources across both storage and compute.

A Neon compute runs Postgres, and storage is a multi-tenant key-value store for Postgres pages that is custom-built for the cloud.

![Neon architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/neon_architecture_3.png)

Neon storage consists of three main components: Safekeepers, Pageservers, and cloud object storage.

Safekeepers are responsible for durability of recent updates.
Postgres streams [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](/docs/reference/glossary#wal) to the Safekeepers, and the Safekeepers store the WAL durably until it has been processed by the Pageservers and uploaded to cloud storage.

Pageservers are responsible for serving read requests. To do that, Pageservers process the incoming WAL stream into a custom storage format that makes all [page](/docs/reference/glossary#page) versions easily accessible. Pageservers also upload data to cloud object storage, and download the data on demand.

Neon uses cloud object storage such as S3 for long-term data storage. Stored data is [encrypted at rest](/docs/reference/glossary#data-at-rest-encryption).

Safekeepers can be thought of as an ultra reliable write buffer that holds the latest data until it is processed and uploaded to cloud storage. Safekeepers implement the Paxos protocol for reliability. Pageservers also function as a read cache for cloud storage, providing fast random access to data pages.

A compute node in Neon is a stateless Postgres process due to the separation of storage and compute. It has two main states: `Active` and `Idle`.

`Active` means that Postgres is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, your compute node is automatically placed into an `Idle` state to save on energy and resources. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can disable this auto-suspension behavior so that a compute always remains active, or they can increase or decrease the amount of time after which a compute is placed into an `Idle` state. Auto-suspension behavior is controlled by an **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting. For information about configuring this setting, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

The _Auto-suspend_ feature is conservative. It treats an "idle-in-transaction" connection as active to avoid breaking application logic that involves long-running transactions. Only connections that are truly inactive are closed after the defined period of inactivity.

When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation can take anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds, meaning that the first connection may have a higher latency than subsequent connections. Cold-start times are fastest in the `US East (Ohio) â aws-us-east-2` region, which hosts the Neon Control Plane. The Neon Control plane will be deployed regionally in future Neon releases, bringing the same millesecond cold-start times to all supported regions.

Also, Postgres shared memory buffers are cold after a compute wakes up from the `Idle` state, which means that initial queries may take longer until the shared memory buffers are warmed.

After a period of time in the `Idle` state, Neon occasionally activates your compute to check for data availability. The time between checks gradually increases if the compute does not receive any client connections over an extended period of time.

You can check if a compute is `Active` or `Idle` and watch as a compute transitions from one state to another in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or on the **Branches** page.

## Compute configuration

Neon only supports modifying session-level configuration parameters. Parameters are reset when the session terminates, such as when the compute suspends due to inactivity.

For information about Neon's Postgres server configuration, see [Neon Postgres parameter settings](/docs/reference/compatibility#neon-postgres-parameter-settings).

For information about Postgres server configuration, see [Server Configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/runtime-config.html), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.


# Features

# Autoscaling

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-09T09:37:25.764Z'

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, available for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users, dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute endpoint in response to the current load, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Autoscaling benefits

Neon's Autoscaling feature offers the following benefits:

- **On-demand scaling:** Autoscaling helps with workloads that experience variations over time, such as applications with regional or time-based changes in demand.
- **Cost effectiveness**: Autoscaling optimizes resource utilization, ensuring that organizations only pay for required resources, rather than over-provisioning to handle peak loads.
- **Resource and cost control**: Autoscaling operates within a user-defined range, ensuring that your compute resources and associated costs do not scale indefinitely.
- **No manual intervention**: After you enable Autoscaling and set scaling limits, no manual intervention is required, allowing you to focus on your applications.

## How to enable Autoscaling

You can enable Autoscaling when creating a Neon project or afterward using a simple compute configuration dialog. For instructions, see:

- [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project)
- [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint)

## How Autoscaling works

A Neon project can have one or more computes, each representing an individual Postgres instance. Storage is decoupled from these computes, meaning that the Postgres servers executing queries are physically separate from the data storage location. This separation offers numerous advantages, including enablement of Neon's Autoscaling feature.

![High-level architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/autoscale-high-level-architecture.webp)

Looking more closely, you can see that each Postgres instance operates within its own virtual machine inside a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-cluster), with multiple VMs hosted on each node of the cluster. Autoscaling is implemented by allocating and deallocating [vCPU](/docs/reference/glossary#vcpu) and [RAM](/docs/reference/glossary#ram) to each VM.

![Autoscaling diagram](/docs/introduction/autoscale-architecture.webp)

### The autoscaler-agent

Each [Kubernetes node](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-node) hosts a single instance of the [autoscaler-agent](/docs/reference/glossary#autoscaler-agent), which serves as the control mechanism for Neon's autoscaling system. The agent collects metrics from the VMs on its node, makes scaling decisions, and performs the necessary checks and requests to implement those decisions.

### The Kubernetes scheduler

A Neon-modified [Kubernetes scheduler](/docs/reference/glossary#kubernetes-scheduler) coordinates with the autoscaler-agent and is the single source of truth for resource allocation. The autoscaler-agent obtains approval for all upscaling from the scheduler. The scheduler maintains a global view of all resource usage changes and approves requests for additional resources from the autoscaler-agent or standard scheduling. In this way, the scheduler assumes responsibility for preventing overcommitting of memory resources. In the rare event that a node exhausts its resources, new pods are not scheduled on the node, and the autoscaler-agent is denied permission to allocate more resources.

### NeonVM

Kubernetes does not natively support the creation or management of VMs. To address this, Neon uses a tool called [NeonVM](/docs/reference/glossary#neonvm). This tool is a custom resource definition and controller for VMs, handling tasks such as adding or removing CPUs and memory. Internally, NeonVM utilizes [QEMU](/docs/reference/glossary#qemu) and [KVM](/docs/reference/glossary#kvm) (where available) to achieve near-native performance.

When an autoscaler-agent needs to modify a VM's resource allocation, it simply updates the corresponding NeonVM object in Kubernetes, and the VM controller then manages the rest of the process.

### Live migration

In cases where a Kubernetes node becomes saturated, NeonVM manages the process of [live migrating](/docs/reference/glossary#live-migration) a VM, transferring the VM from one machine to another with minimal interruptions (typically around 100ms). Live migration transmits the internal state of the original VM to a new one while the former continues to operate, swiftly transitioning to the new VM after most of the data is copied. From within the VM, the only indication that a migration occurred might be a temporary performance reduction. Importantly, the VM retains its IP address, ensuring that connections are preserved and queries remain uninterrupted.

The live migration process allows for the proactive reduction of node load by migrating VMs away before reaching capacity. Although it is still possible for the node to fill up in the interim, Neon's separation of storage and compute means that VMs typically use minimal disk space, resulting in fast migrations.

### Memory scaling

Postgres memory consumption can escalate rapidly in specific scenarios. Fortunately, Neon's Autoscaling system is able to detect memory usage increases without constantly requesting metrics from the VM. This is accomplished by running Postgres within a [cgroups](/docs/reference/glossary#cgroups), which provides notifications when memory usage crosses a specified threshold. Using cgroups in this way requires running our [vm-informant](/docs/reference/glossary#vm-informant) in the VM alongside Postgres to request more resources from the autoscaler-agent when Postgres consumes too much memory. The vm-informant also verifies that downscaling requests from an autoscaler-agent will leave sufficient memory leftover.

### Local file cache

To expedite queries, the Autoscaling system incorporates a Postgres extension that places a cache in front of the storage layer. Many queries benefit from this additional memory, particularly those requiring multiple database scans (such as creating an index). The [local file cache](/docs/reference/glossary#local-file-cache) capitalizes on the additional memory allocated to the VM by dedicating a portion to the cache to itself. The cache is backed by disk and kept at a size intended to fit in the kernel page cache. Due to the storage model, writebacks are not required, resulting in near-instant evictions. The vm-informant adjusts the local file cache size when scaling occurs through the autoscaler-agent, ensuring seamless operation.

# Auto-suspend

enableTableOfContents: true

Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature controls when a Neon compute instance transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity.

By default, a Neon compute instance scales to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, this setting is fixed. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can increase, decrease, or disable the _Auto-suspend_ setting, controlling when or if a compute scales to zero.

Reasons for adjusting the _Auto-suspend_ setting might include:

- **Avoiding cold starts**. Restarting a compute from an `Idle` state can take anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds (see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle)). You can turn off the _Auto-suspend_ feature to avoid cold starts. For compute time cost information, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
- **Reducing the frequency of cold starts**. You can configure _Auto-suspend_ to occur less frequently, keeping your compute active during busier hours while ensuring that it suspends when usage drops off.
- **Suspending a compute more quickly to reduce compute usage**. Compute startup times can be as low as 500 ms, which may be sufficient for your purposes. In this case, you can suspend computes more frequently reduce compute usage.

You can configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting in an existing project by editing a compute endpoint. You can also configure it when you first create a Neon project, which sets the _Auto-suspend_ default for the project. For instructions, refer to [Configuring Auto-suspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

<a id="branches-coming-soon/"></a>

With Neon, you can quickly and cost-effectively branch your data for development, testing, and various other purposes, enabling you to improve developer productivity and optimize continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## What is a branch?

A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data. You can create a branch from a current or past state. For example, you can create a branch that includes all data up to the current time or an earlier time.

A branch is isolated from its originating data, so you are free to play around with it, modify it, or delete it when it's no longer needed. Changes to a branch are independent. A branch and its parent can share the same history (within the defined [point-in-time restore](/docs/reference/glossary#point-in-time-restore) window) but diverge at the point of branch creation. Writes to a branch are saved as a delta.

Creating a branch does not increase load on the parent branch or affect it in any way, which means you can create a branch without impacting the performance of your production system.

Each Neon project is created with a root branch called `main`. The first branch that you create is branched from the project's root branch. Subsequent branches can be branched from the root branch or from a previously created branch.

## Branching workflows

You can use Neon's branching feature in variety workflows.

### Development

You can create a branch of your production database that developers are free to play with and modify. By default, branches are created with all of the data that existed in the parent branch, eliminating the setup time required to deploy and maintain a development database.

![development environment branch](/docs/introduction/branching_dev_env.png)

The following video shows how to create a branch in the Neon Console. For step-by-step instructions, see [Create a branch](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch).

<video autoPlay playsInline muted loop width="800" height="600">
  <source type="video/mp4" src="/docs/introduction/create_branch.mp4"/>
</video>

You can integrate branching into your development workflows and toolchains using the Neon CLI, API, or GitHub Actions. If you use Vercel, you can use the Neon Vercel Integration to create a branch for each preview deployment.

</DetailIconCards>

### Testing

Testers can create branches for testing schema changes, validating new queries, or testing potentially destructive queries before deploying them to production. A branch is isolated from its parent branch but has all of the parent branch's data up to the point of branch creation, which eliminates the effort involved in hydrating a database. Tests can also run on separate branches in parallel, with each branch having dedicated compute resources.

### Data recovery

If you lose data due to an unintended deletion or some other event, you can create a branch from the past to recover the lost data.

Neon retains a history of changes for all branches, enabling point-in-time restore. This feature allows you to restore data to any point within the retention period. You can use the point-in-time restore feature as a database [backup](/docs/manage/backups) strategy, to view the past state of your database, or to recover lost data.

## History retention

The history retention period is 7 days, by default, but is configurable. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users.

You can configure the **History retention** setting in the Neon Console, under **Settings** > **Storage**. For further instructions, see [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).
![History retention configuration](/docs/relnotes/history_retention.png)

Increasing the history retention period affects all branches in your Neon project and increases [project storage](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage). You can scale **History retention** down to zero if reducing storage cost is more important than the ability to restore your data to a past state.

History is retained in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records. As WAL records age out of the retention period, they are evicted from storage and no longer count toward project storage.

A point-in-time restore operation is performed by creating a branch using the **Time** or **LSN** option. Your **History retention** period dictates how far back you can restore your data. To learn how to perform a point-in-time restore operation, refer to [Branching â Point-in-time restore](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

Neon read replicas are independent read-only compute instances designed to perform read operations on the same data as your read-write computes. Neon read replicas do not replicate data across database instances. Instead, read requests are directed to a single source â a capability made possible by Neon's architecture, which separates storage and compute. The following diagram shows how read-write and read-only compute instances send read requests to the same Neon [Pageserver](/docs/reference/glossary#pageserver).

![Read-only compute instances](/docs/introduction/read_replicas.png)

In data replication terms, Neon read replicas are asynchronous, which means they are _eventually consistent_. As updates are made by read-write computes, Safekeepers store the data changes durably until they are processed by Pageservers. At the same time, Safekeepers keep read-only computes up to date with the latest changes to maintain data consistency.

Neon supports creating read replicas in the same region as your database. Cross-region read replicas are currently not supported. You can expect that feature in a future release.

You can instantly create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the amount of vCPU and memory allocated to each. Read replicas also support Neon's Autoscaling and Auto-suspend features, providing you with control over the compute resources used by your read replicas.

</video>

## Use cases

Neon's read replicas have a number of potential applications:

- **Increase throughput**: By distributing read requests among multiple read replicas, you can achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.
- **Workload offloading**: Assign reporting or analytical workloads to a read replica to prevent any impact on the performance of read-write application workloads.
- **Access control**: Provide read-only data access to certain users or applications that do not need write access.
- **Resource customization**: Configure different CPU and memory resources for each read replica to cater to the specific needs of different users and applications.

## Advantages

Advantages of Neon's read replica feature include the following:

1. **Efficient storage**: With read-only compute instances reading from the same source as your read-write computes, no additional storage is required to create a read replica. Data is neither duplicated nor replicated, which means zero additional storage cost.
2. **Data consistency**: Read-write and read-only compute instances read data from a single source, ensuring a high degree of data consistency.
3. **Scalability**: With no data replication required, you can create read replicas almost instantly, providing fast and seamless scalability. You can also scale read replica compute resources the same way you scale read-write compute resources.
4. **Cost effectiveness**: By removing the need for additional storage and data replication, costs associated with storage and data transfer are avoided. Neon's read replicas also benefit from Neon's [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling) and [Auto-suspend](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) features, which enable efficient management of compute resources.
5. **Instant availability**. With an architecture that separates storage and compute, you can allow read-replicas to scale to zero when not in use without introducing lag. When a read replica starts up, it is up to date with your read-write primary almost instantly.

## Get started with read replicas

The first step to leveraging Neon's read replica feature is to sign up for the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). After subscribing, you will be able to create and configure read replicas. To get started, refer to the [Working with read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) guide.

Neon's logical replication feature, available to all Neon users, allows you to stream data from your Neon database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. These destinations might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others.

![Neon logical replication subscribers image](/docs/guides/logical_replication_subscribers.png)

Logical replication in Neon works in the same way as logical replication on a standard Postgres installation, using a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.

Neon's IP Allow feature, available with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan), ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). 

You can configure **IP Allow** in your Neon project's settings. To get started, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

Neon supports project deployment in several regions. We recommended that you select the region closest to your application server to reduce latency between your Neon project and your application.

## Available regions

Neon currently supports the following AWS regions:

- US East (N. Virginia) &mdash; `aws-us-east-1`
- US East (Ohio) &mdash; `aws-us-east-2`
- US West (Oregon) &mdash; `aws-us-west-2`
- Europe (Frankfurt) &mdash; `aws-eu-central-1`
- Asia Pacific (Singapore) &mdash; `aws-ap-southeast-1`
- Israel (Tel Aviv) &mdash; `aws-il-central-1`

## Select a region for your Neon project

You can select the region for your Neon project during project creation. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

All branches and databases created in a Neon project are created in the region selected for the project.

![Select region image](/docs/introduction/project_creation_regions.png)

<Admonition type="note">
After you select a region for a Neon project, it cannot be changed for that project.
</Admonition>

## Move project data to a new region

If you need to move your data to a different region, the following steps are recommended:

1. Create a new project in the desired region. For project creation instructions, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
1. Move your data from the old project to the new project. For instructions, see [Import data from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).

<Admonition type="note">
Neon Free Tier users are limited to a single project. In this case, you can export your data using `pg_dump`, remove your existing project, create a new project in the desired region, and import your data into the new project.
</Admonition>

Moving data to a new Neon project may require downtime if you are moving a production database, as the import procedure may take some time depending on the size of your data. To prevent the loss of data during the import operation, consider disabling writes from your applications before initiating the import operation. You can re-enable writes when the import is completed. Neon does not currently support disabling database writes. Writes must be disabled at the application level.

To request support for additional regions, please visit the [Hosting in other AWS regions](https://community.neon.tech/t/hosting-in-other-aws-regions/81/5) topic in the Neon Community Forum.

**Notes:**

- The Neon Pro Plan has default limits of 20 projects, 200 GiB of storage, and 20 simultaneously active computes to protect against unintended usage. To increase these limits, please [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support). The simultaneously active compute limit does not affect the primary branch compute, which always remains available.
- The Neon Free Tier has an [Active time](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) limit of 100 hours per month, but that limit only affects non-primary branch compute usage. Active time on all computes is counted toward the limit, but when the limit is exceeded, only non-primary branch computes are subject to suspension. **Your primary branch compute always remains available regardless of the limit, ensuring that access to data on your primary branch is never interrupted.** You can monitor _Active time_ on the **Usage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. The _Active time_ limit resets at the beginning of each month. For instance, if you enroll in the Neon Free Tier on January 15th, your _Active time_ limit will reset on February 1st.

- Unlimited Postgres databases
- A shared compute with 1 GB of RAM for each branch.
- 100 hours of _Active time_ per month, affecting non-primary branch compute usage only. Active time on all computes is counted toward the limit, but when the limit is exceeded, only non-primary branch computes are subject to suspension. **Your primary branch compute always remains available regardless of the limit, ensuring that access to data on your primary branch is never interrupted.** You can monitor _Active time_ on the **Usage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. The _Active time_ limit resets at the beginning of each month. For instance, if you enroll in the Neon Free Tier in the middle of the month, say on January 15th, your _Active time_ limit will reset on February 1st, the first day of the following month.
- A point-in-time restore window of 7 days of _reasonable usage_.

For higher limits and access to advanced features like _Autoscaling_, _Unlimited storage_,  _Project sharing_, and _Read replicas_, upgrade to our **Pro** plan. For more information, see [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan), or select **Upgrade to Pro** in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).

<Admonition type="note">
Neon reserves the right to adjust Neon Free Tier limits, and to discontinue or limit compute usage in exceptional cases where misuse is identified, in order to protect the integrity of our platform and ensure a positive experience for all users.

The Neon Pro Plan plan is intended for users who have completed their evaluation of Neon on the Neon Free Tier and are ready to transition to a production-level plan with higher limits and advanced features.

Because the Neon Pro Plan is usage-based, you never have to worry about over-provisioning. You only pay for what you use. Transitioning to the Neon Pro Plan has been designed to be as smooth and hassle-free as possible. However, we understand that the Neon Pro Plan might not be for everyone &mdash; so if it turns out to be more than you need, reverting to the Neon Free Tier is a simple process. There are no fixed contracts or obligations.

## What comes with the Neon Pro Plan?

Upgrading to the Neon Pro Plan gives you higher limits, advanced features, and added support. Let's look at each of these items in more detail.

### Higher limits

- **More projects:** The Neon Pro Plan offers unlimited projects, while the Neon Free Tier offers only one. But what is a Neon project, and why would you need more than one? A project is a top-level container in Neon for your computes, branches, databases, and roles. Projects are a way to organize your resources and usage. If you are a company that develops data-driven applications, it might make sense to create a project for each client or each application. For information about objects that a project contains, see [The Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview).
- **Unlimited storage:** The Neon Pro Plan supports any data size. There's a default limit of 200 GiB to protect your account from unintended use, but if you [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support), we can raise the limit to whatever you require.
- **Unlimited branches:** With the Neon Pro Plan, there is no limit on branches. You can create as many branches as required to support your CI/CD pipeline. You can instantly and cost-effectively create a database branch for every preview deployment, client, or developer.
- **Unlimited databases:** There is no limit on Postgres databases in any Neon plan. You can create as many databases as you need.

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon Pro Plan has default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect against unintended usage. To request an increase this limit, please [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support). The simultaneously active compute limit does not affect the primary branch compute, which always remains available. If you encounter `Console request failed` errors, this may indicate that you have reached the active compute limit.
</Admonition>

### Advanced features

The Neon Pro Plan comes with the following advanced features, and we plan to add more.

- **Autoscaling:** The _Autoscaling_ feature automatically adjusts compute size based on demand. You set a maximum and minimum compute size, and the Autoscaling feature automatically scales compute resources between those boundaries for optimum performance and cost-efficiency. No manual intervention is required to handle sudden usage spikes, and no downtime is required to reconfigure system resources. Neon Pro Plan users can enable and configure Autoscaling in the Neon Console. For instructions, see [Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
- **Larger computes:** The Neon Pro Plan supports computes with up to **7 vCPUs and 28 GB of RAM**, providing the processing power  to handle any workload. By comparison, the Neon Free Tier provides .25 vCPUs and 1GB of RAM, which is great for prototyping and evaluation but less than needed at scale. For configuration instructions, see [Compute size configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
- **Configurable Auto-suspend:** The Neon Free Tier automatically suspends computes after 5 minutes of inactivity. With the Neon Neon Pro Plan, you can increase or decrease this time period, or you can disable the Auto-suspend feature entirely. A shorter delay, such as 60 seconds, can potentially reduce compute costs. A longer delay keeps your compute active for longer intervals, reducing the number of cold starts. To prevent cold starts entirely, in cases where even a few seconds delay is too much, you can disable the Auto-suspend feature entirely so that your compute is always active. The Auto-suspend feature is configured in the Neon Console. For instructions, see [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Project sharing:** The _Project sharing_ feature lets you share your Neon projects with other Neon users. Project sharing is managed on the **Settings** page in the Neon Console. Simply add the email account of the user you want to share your project with. Projects can be shared with any Neon user, including Neon Free Tier users. Usage is applied to the project owner's Neon account. For instructions, see [Share a project](/docs/manage/projects#share-a-project).
- **Read replicas:** Neon's read replica feature enhances scalability and performance by allowing you to create read-only compute instances that operate on the same data as your read-write computes. With this feature, you can offload analytics or reporting queries, efficiently distribute read requests to achieve higher throughput, or provide read-only data access to certain users or applications. For more information, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).
- **IP Allow:** Control access to the branch where your database resides. Any IP address not on the allowlist is automatically blocked, ensuring that only authorized IP addresses can access your data. The allowlist can be applied to all branches (the default) or to your [primary branch](#primary-branch) only. For more information, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

### Added support

In addition to the [community forum](https://community.neon.tech/) and the ability to open support tickets, Neon Pro Plan users have access to Neon Support via video chat. Please [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support) to request a video chat.

## How does billing work?

The Neon Pro Plan bills for usage monthly. Please refer to our [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing) page for information about metrics and rates. To estimate monthly costs, try the [pricing calculator](/calculator) or the [Pro Plan Cost Estimator](/docs/introduction/billing#pro-plan-cost-estimator) in the Neon Console. If you still have questions or need help estimating costs, please reach out to our [Sales](/contact-sales) team. We're ready to help.

## How do I upgrade to Pro?

You can click on **Upgrade to Pro** in the Neon Console or click [here](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?show_enroll_to_pro=true) to sign up.

After upgrading to a Neon Pro Plan account, Neon Free Tier limits are lifted the next time your project's compute endpoint restarts.

<Admonition type="note">
If your compute was active before upgrading, it continues to be bound by Neon Free Tier limits until it restarts, which can result in limit-related errors such as this one if Neon Free Tier limits are exceeded:

```text
ERROR: could not extend file because cluster size limit (3072 MB) has been exceeded
HINT: This limit is defined by neon.max_cluster_size GUC
```

To force a restart of your compute endpoint, you can temporarily set your compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second (the default is 5 minutes). See [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions. Alternatively, you can issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint interrupts any connections currently using the compute endpoint.
</Admonition>

## How do I downgrade?

If you find that the Neon Pro Plan isn't for you, you can downgrade in just a few clicks. Follow the steps described in [Downgrade your plan](/docs/introduction/manage-billing#downgrade-your-plan).

The largest part of your bill typically comes from compute costs &#8212; the size of your compute plus your level of activity. Storage costs make up the next largest part of your bill. The amount of data that you write, either to storage within Neon or data egress outside of Neon, also adds to your cost, though typically a small percentage per month.

## Compute costs
With key features like [autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide), [auto-suspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide), minimum and max [compute sizes](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) enabled, you can get a sense of how your compute costs might accrue in the following graph.

![Compute metrics graph](/docs/introduction/compute-metrics2.png)

You can see how the compute time that you get billed for scales between your minimum and maximum CPU settings: compute time never rises above your max level, and it never drops below your minimum setting. With autosuspend, you are not charged at all during inactive periods. For projects with inconsistent demand, this can save significant compute costs.

For a more detailed breakdown of compute cost metrics, see [compute time](docs/introduction/billing#compute-time).

## Storage costs

Neon storage uses copy-on-write branching to keep storage size as small as possible. This can make it hard to visualize "how big is my database", since branches with a shared history don't immediately add to storage costs. Storage size is a combination of your total data plus the shared change history that is used to enable branching-related features like [point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore), [query testing](/docs/guides/branching-test-queries), and [reset from parent](docs/manage/branches#reset-a-branch-from-parent).

Storage costs are based on the size of your project and how long it is stored.

![Storage calculation](/docs/introduction/storage_calc.jpg)

For a detailed explanation about storage costs, see [Project storage](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

## Data write and transfer costs

The amount of data that you write to storage or transfer out of Neon (for example, to serve data requests from an external application, stream data to another service, or set up an offline database backup) also contributes to your costs. In typical projects, these costs add up to less than 5% per month.

![Data write and transfer](/docs/introduction/neon_boundary.jpg)

For more detail on these metrics, see [Written data](docs/introduction/billing#written-data) and [Data transfer](/docs/introduction/billing#data-transfer).

If you already have a sense of your sizing and usage needs, we recommend that you try out the [Pricing Calculator](#pricing-calculator) on our website or our [Pro Plan Cost Estimator](#pro-plan-cost-estimator) in the Neon Console. These tools let you estimate monthly costs based on the billing metrics above.

## Things to consider before using

With autoscaling as the key to our pay-for-use model, you will ideally have some sense of what kind of usage your application requires before you try out our calculators. A few questions for you to consider:
* _How active are your users_?
* _What level of performance does your applciation require_?
* _How much storage do you require_?

These questions translate into the metrics [active time](/docs/introduction/billing#active-time), [compute size](docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration), and [storage space](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

## Pricing calculator

The [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page on the Neon website provides a [calculator](https://neon.tech/calculator) that allows you to estimate monthly costs based on usage amounts that you provide.

![Pricing page calculator](/docs/introduction/pricing_page_calculator.png)

## Pro Plan Cost Estimator

The **Billing** page in the Neon Console provides a **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** tool, which estimates costs based on your current project usage. If you have ever wondered, "How much would my monthly cost be if I upgraded to the Neon Pro Plan?", this tool provides the answer. To access it, navigate to the **Billing** page via the sidebar of the Neon Console, and select **Open Cost Estimator**.

To provide cost estimates, the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** requires at least one month of project usage.

Neon [paid plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans) bill for usage based on the following metrics:

- **Compute time**: The amount of compute resources used per hour.
- **Project storage**: The volume of data and history stored in your Neon project.
- **Written data**: The volume of data written from compute to storage.
- **Data transfer**: The volume of data transferred out of Neon.

The following sections describe each metric and the billing rates for each region. Billing in Neon is account-based.

<Admonition type="note">
_Compute time_ is typically The largest contributor to cost. _Written data_ and _Data transfer_ together usually account for only about 5% of your monthly bill.

The **Project storage**, **Written data**, and **Data transfer** metrics are calculated in gibibytes (GiB), otherwise known as binary gigabytes. One gibibyte equals 2<sup>30</sup> or 1,073,741,824 bytes.
</Admonition>

## Compute time

_Compute time_ is the amount of compute resources used per hour. It is calculated by multiplying compute size by _Active time_ hours. Neon measures compute size at regular intervals and averages those values to calculate _Compute time_.

_Active time_ is the total amount of time that your computes have been active within a given billing period, measured in hours. This includes all computes in your Neon project but excludes time when computes are in an `Idle` state due to [auto-suspension](/docs/reference/glossary#auto-suspend-compute) (scale-to-zero). _Active time_ is not a billed metric. It is a factor of the _Compute time_ metric.

Compute size is measured in _Compute Units (CUs)_. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 7 CUs, as outlined below:

| Compute Units | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |
| 7             | 7    | 28 GB  |

A connection from a client or application activates a compute. Activity on the connection keeps the compute in an `Active` state. A defined period of inactivity (5 minutes by default) places the compute into an `Idle` state.

Factors that affect _Compute time_ include:

- The number of active computes
- The size of each compute
- The _Auto-suspend_ feature, which suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the `Auto-suspend` timeout timeout or disable _Auto-suspend_ entirely.
- The _Autoscaling_ feature, which allows you to set a minimum and maximum compute size. Compute size automatically scales up and down between these boundaries based on workload.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon uses a small amount of _Compute time_, included in your billed amount, to perform a periodic check to ensure that your computes can start and read and write data. See [Availability Checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker) for more information.
</Admonition>

The _Compute time_ cost calculation is as follows:

```text
Compute time cost = Compute size * Active time * price per hour
```

### Compute time cost estimates

For an idea of _Compute time_ cost per month based on compute size and usage, refer to the following table. Compute size is measured in Compute Units (CUs).

| Compute Units      | 730 hrs/mth (all hours) | 173 hrs/mth (working hours) | 87 hrs/mth (half of working hours) |
| :----------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| 0.25               | $18.62                  | $4.41                       | $2.22                              |
| 0.5                | $37.23                  | $8.82                       | $4.44                              |
| 1                  | $74.46                  | $17.65                      | $8.87                              |

<Admonition type="note">
The prices in the table above are based on US East (Ohio) _Compute time_ rates.
</Admonition>

- Public-facing applications are assumed to be active for all hours in a month (730 hrs/mth).
- Internal applications with consistent usage are assumed to be active during working hours (173 hrs/mth).
- Internal applications with moderate usage are assumed to be active half of working hours (87 hrs/mth).

### Estimate your compute time cost

To estimate your own monthly _Compute time_ cost:

1. Determine the compute size you require, in Compute Units (CUs).
1. Estimate the amount of _Active time_ per month for your compute(s).
1. Find the _Compute-time_ price for your region. The [billing rates](#billing-rates) table shows _Compute-time_ prices by region.
1. Input the values into the _Compute time_ cost formula:

   ```text
   Compute time cost = Compute size * Active time * Compute-time price
   ```

   For example, this is the calculation for the smallest compute offered by Neon (.25 CUs), 730 hours, and a _Compute time_ price of $0.102:

   ```text
   .25 * 730 * 0.102 = $18.62
   ```

<Admonition type="tip">
Neon also provides calculators to help with cost estimates. See [Pricing calculators](#pricing-calculators).
</Admonition>

## Project storage

_Project storage_ is the total volume of data and history stored in your Neon project, measured in gibibyte hours (GiB-hours). It includes the following:

- **Current data size**

  The size of all databases in your Neon projects. You can think of this as a _snapshot_ of your data at a point in time.

- **History**

  Neon retains a history of changes for all branches to support _point-in-time restore_.

  - _Point-in-time restore_ is the ability to restore data to an earlier point in time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of WAL records. You can configure the history retention period. See [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore). WAL records that age out of the history retention period are evicted from storage and no longer count toward project storage.
  - A _database branch_ is a virtual snapshot of your data at the point of branch creation combined with WAL records that capture the branch's data change history from that point forward.
    When a branch is first created, it adds no storage. No data changes have been introduced yet, and the branch's virtual snapshot still exists in the parent branch's _history_, which means that it shares this data in common with the parent branch. A branch begins adding to storage when data changes are introduced or when the branch's virtual snapshot falls out of the parent branch's _history_, in which case the branch's data is no longer shared in common. In other words, branches add storage when you modify data or allow the branch to age out of the parent branch's _history_.

    Database branches can also share a _history_. For example, two branches created from the same parent at or around the same time share a _history_, which avoids additional storage. The same is true for a branch created from another branch. Wherever possible, Neon minimizes storage through shared history. Additionally, to keep storage to a minimum, Neon takes a new branch snapshot if the amount of data changes grows to the point that a new snapshot consumes less storage than retained WAL records.

The cost calculation for _Project storage_ is as follows:

```text
Project storage (GiB) * (seconds stored / 3600) * price per hour
```

## Written data

_Written data_ measures the total volume of data written from compute to storage within a given billing period, measured in gigibytes (GiB). Writing data from compute to storage ensures the durability and integrity of your data, as it reflects the data changes made by your computes.

The cost calculation for _Written data_ is as follows:

```text
Written data (GiB) * price per GiB
```

## Data transfer

_Data transfer_ measures the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (known as "egress") during a given billing period, measured in gigibytes (GiB). It includes data sent from your Neon project to external destinations. If your data transfer is high, contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales) for custom solutions to minimize data transfer costs.

The cost calculation for _Data transfer_ is as follows:

```text
Data transfer (GiB) * price per GiB
```

\* A _Compute-hour_ is based on a compute size of 1 Compute Unit (CU), which is 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM. Neon's smallest compute size is .25 CU (.25 vCPU and 1GB of RAM), which would be billed at 1/4 of a _Compute-hour_. Neon supports compute sizes ranging from .25 CU (.25 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM) to 7 CUs (7 vCPU and 28 GB of RAM). If you require larger computes, contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

## Generative AI example

To give you a clearer sense of how billing works for Neon Pro users, let's explore a real-world example. Consider a simple image generation app that leverages Neon as the serverless database for storing user authentication details as well as records of image generation per user. Analyzing this usage over a monthly billing period can help you understand the nuances of Neon billing based on actual scenarios.

## Overview: Costs by usage

Roughly six months since launch, this high-traffic application attracts about 80K visitors daily, up to 450K weekly. It receives a steady influx of new users, with 3-5 new accounts created every hour. Each user's activity is capped at 5 images per month. This pattern of interaction and account creation gives you a sense of the steady volume of activity hitting the database. 

## Assumptions

### Tech stack (user management portion of the app):
* **Authentication**: [NextAuth.JS](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication with OAuth
* **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL to store user info and session detail
* **ORM**: [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) for database interactions
* **Deployment Region**: US East (Ohio)

### Userbase:
* **Daily Active Users.** 80,000 users/day, implying a consistent volume of read queries. With a global, consumer-oriented user base, traffic is evenly distributed with no distinct peaks or dormant periods.
* **Account creation.** Average of 3-5 sign-ups per hour, totaling 120 new accounts per day. This gives you an idea of the number of write operations to the database for user authentication.
* **User activity.** Each user's usage is capped at 5 generations per month. This includes logging IDs of generated photos and the incremental number of generations, which are written to the relevant tables.

<Admonition type="note">
Given the high number of connections used by this application, [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling) is essential. And since the database connection is managed through Prisma, the database connection string also requires the addition of `?pgbouncer=true` for proper performance (see [Use connection pooling with Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma)). 
</Admonition>

### Compute, storage, data write and transfer:

* **Compute time.** This metric refers to the size of CPU required to handle your interactions plus the length of time your compute is active. The average daily compute usage is 23.94 GB, totaling 718.35 GB for the sample month. This indicates steady but low-intensity database usage.
* **Storage size.** The amount of database storage currently used by your project. It includes the total volume of data across all branches plus the shared history. The database is now over 25 GiB and growing steadily with new written data as the user base grows.
* **Written data.** This metric shows the volume of data actively written to database storage. The daily average of 0.15 GB results in a total of 4.4 GB for the month.
* **Data transfer.** This refers to the amount of data transferred out of Neon. Daily average is 0.09 GB with a monthly total of 2.7 GB.

## Consumption breakdown for the month

These graphs show the usage and costs incurred for the month.

### Compute

Compute usage is steady at almost 24 compute hours per day across the month.

![Sample billing graph](/docs/introduction/billing_compute_graph.png)

Daily average of 23.94 compute hours leads to a total of 713.35 compute hours for the month.

Compute cost calculation: 718.35 compute-hours * $0.102 per compute-hour = **$73.27** for this billing period

### Storage

Project storage grew 4.4 GiB over the month, from 23.6 GiB to 28 GiB.

Storage cost calculation: 28 GiB * $0.000164 per GiB-hour * 730 (1 month) = **$3.35** for this billing period

![Sample storage graph](/docs/introduction/billing_storage_graph.png)

### Data throughput
Written data to Neon storage and data transfer out of Neon are both minimal for the month. 

**Written data calcuation**: 4.4 GiB * $0.09600 per Gib = **$0.42** for this billing period

**Data transfer calculation**: 2.7 GiB * $0.09000 per GiB = **$0.24** for the billing period

![Sample storage graph](/docs/introduction/billing_data_graph.png)

### Table view

Here are the daily averages and monthly totals for the 3 key usage metrics that Neon uses to calculate your bill, plus the total current storage costs.

| Metric          | Daily Average | Monthly Total |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Compute Time    | 23.94 compute-hours      | 718.35 compute-hours    |
| Written Data    | 0.15 GiB      | 4.4 GiB        |
| Data Transfer   | 0.09 GiB       | 2.7 GiB        |

 Metric           | Start of billing period| End of billing period |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Data storage    | 23.6 GiB        | 28 GiB         |

## Bill for the month

This table shows what the billing costs might look like with billing rates set to the region US-East (Ohio).

| Metric              | Month      | Rate                  | Amount    |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Compute Time Cost   | 718.35 GiB | $0.102 per compute-hour        | $73.27    |
| Data Storage Cost   | 28 GiB   | $0.000164 per GiB-hour| $3.35
| Written Data Cost   | 4.4 GiB    | $0.09600 per Gib      | $0.42     |
| Data Transfer Cost  | 2.7 GiB    | $0.09000 per GiB      | $0.24     |
| **Total Bill**      |            |                       | **$77.28**|

The Neon SQL Editor allows you to run queries on your Neon databases directly from the Neon Console. In addition, the editor keeps a query history, permits saving queries, and provides [**Explain**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) and [**Analyze**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-ANALYZE) features.

<a id="query-via-ui/"></a>

To use the SQL Editor:

1. Navigate to the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/).
2. Select your project.
3. Select **SQL Editor**.
4. Select a branch and database.
5. Enter a query into the editor and click **Run** to view the results.

![Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/sql_editor.png)

You can use the following query to try the SQL Editor. The query creates a table, adds data, and retrieves the data from the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE playing_with_neon(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, value REAL);
INSERT INTO playing_with_neon(name, value)
SELECT LEFT(md5(i::TEXT), 10), random() FROM generate_series(1, 10) s(i);
SELECT * FROM playing_with_neon;
```

Running multiple query statements at once returns a separate result set for each statement. The result sets are displayed in separate tabs, numbered in order of execution, as shown above.

To clear the editor, click **New Query**.

<Admonition type="tip">
When querying objects such as tables and columns with upper case letters in their name, remember to enclose the identifier name in quotes. For example: `SELECT * FROM "Company"`. Postgres changes identifier names to lower case unless they are quoted. The same applies when creating objects in Postgres. For example, `CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(id INT)` creates a table named `department` in Postgres. For more information about how quoted and unquoted identifiers are treated by Postgres, see [Identifiers and Key Words](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.
</Admonition>

## Save your queries

The SQL Editor allows you to save your queries.

To save a query:

1. Enter the query into the editor.
2. Click **Save** to open the **SAVE QUERY** dialog.
3. Enter a name for the query and click **Save**.

The query is added to the **Saved** list in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can rerun a query by selecting it from the **Saved** list.

You can rename or delete a saved query by selecting **Rename** or **Delete** from the kebab menu associated with the saved query.

## View the query history

The SQL Editor maintains a query history for the project. To view your query history, select **History** in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can click an item in the **History** list to view the query that was run.

## Explain and Analyze

The Neon SQL Editor provides **Explain** and **Analyze** features.

- The **Explain** feature runs the specified query with the Postgres [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) command, which returns the execution plan for the query. The **Explain** feature only returns a plan with estimates. It does not execute the query.
- The **Analyze** feature runs the specified query with [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-ANALYZE). The `ANALYZE` parameter causes the query to be executed and returns actual row counts and run times for plan nodes along with the `EXPLAIN` estimates.

Understanding the information provided by the **Explain** and **Analyze** features requires familiarity with the Postgres [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) command and its `ANALYZE` parameter. Refer to the [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) documentation and the [Using EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html) topic in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.

When connecting to Neon from an application or client, you connect to a database in your Neon project. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which may be the primary branch of your project (`main`) or a child branch.

You can obtain the database connection details you require from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a compute, a database, and a role. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#connection-pooling).

A Neon connection string includes the role, the hostname, and the database name.

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- role        |- hostname                                     |- database
```

<Admonition type="note">
The hostname includes the ID of the compute endpoint, which has an `ep-` prefix: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`. For more information about Neon connection strings, see [Connection string](/docs/reference/glossary#connection-string).
</Admonition>

You can use the details from the connection string or the connection string itself to configure a connection. For example, you might place the connection details in an `.env` file, assign the connection string to a variable, or pass the connection string on the command-line.

`.env` file:

```text
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
```

Variable:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

</CodeBlock>

Command-line:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
psql postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="note">
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection by appending an `sslmode` parameter setting to your connection string. For instructions, see [Connect to Neon securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).
</Admonition>

## Where do I obtain a password?

You can obtain a Neon connection string with your password from the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**.

## What port does Neon use?

Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.

## Connection examples

The **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard** also provides connection examples for different programming languages and application frameworks, constructed for the branch, database, and role that you select.

![Language and framework connection examples](/docs/connect/code_connection_examples.png)

Our *Guides* documentation also provides connection examples.

## Network protocol support

Neon currently supports **IPv4**. Support for other network protocols, including IPv6, is **not available** at this time.

Additionally, Neon provides a serverless driver that supports both WebSocket and HTTP connections. For further information, refer to our [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) documentation.

## Connection notes

- Some older client libraries and drivers, including older `psql` executables, are built without [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/docs/reference/glossary#sni) support and require a workaround. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).
- Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For an example, see [Connect a GUI or IDE](/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#connect-to-the-database).

This topic describes how to connect to a Neon database from a GUI application or IDE. Most GUI applications and IDEs that support connecting to a Postgres database also support connecting to Neon.

## Gather your connection details

The following details are typically required when configuring a connection:

- hostname
- port
- database name
- role (user)
- password

You can gather these details from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

<Admonition type="note">
Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#connection-pooling).
</Admonition>

The connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- <role>      |- <hostname>                                   |- <database>
```

- role name: `alex`
- hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- database name: `dbname`

Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.

## Connect to the database

In the GUI application or IDE, enter the connection details into the appropriate fields and connect. Some applications permit specifying a connection string while others require entering connection details into separate fields. In the pgAdmin example below, connection details are entered into separate fields, and clicking **Save** establishes the database connection.

![Register - Server](/docs/connect/pgadmin4.png)

Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For example, the DBeaver client has a **URL** field, but connecting to Neon requires specifying the connection details as shown:

![DBeaver connection](/docs/connect/dbeaver_connection.png)

## Tested GUI applications and IDEs

Connections from the GUI applications and IDEs in the table below have been tested with Neon.

<Admonition type="note">
Some applications require an Server Name Indication (SNI) workaround. Neon uses compute endpoint domain names to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer the server domain name, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this. Not all application clients support SNI. In these cases, a workaround is required. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).

Neon's `psql` passwordless auth feature helps you quickly authenticate a connection to Neon without providing a password.

The following instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), an interactive terminal for working with Postgres. For information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

To connect using Neon's `psql` passwordless auth feature:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   psql -h pg.neon.tech
   ```

   A response similar to the following is displayed:

   ```bash
   NOTICE:  Welcome to Neon!
   Authenticate by visiting:
       https://console.neon.tech/psql_session/6d32af5ef8215b62
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to the provided link. Log in to Neon if you are not already logged in. You are asked to select a Neon project to connect to. If your project has more than one compute endpoint, you are also asked to select one.

   After making your selections, you are advised that you can return to your terminal or command window where information similar to the following is displayed:

   ```bash
   NOTICE:  Connecting to database.
   psql (15.0 (Ubuntu 15.0-1.pgdg22.04+1))
   Type "help" for help.

   casey=>
   ```

   The passwordless auth feature connects to the first database created in the branch. To check the database you are connected to, issue this query:

   ```sql
   SELECT current_database();
    current_database
   ------------------
    neondb
    ```

    Switching databases from the `psql` prompt (using `\c <database_name>`, for example) after you have authenticated restarts the passwordless auth authentication process to authenticate a connection to the new database.

## Running queries

After establishing a connection, try running the following queries:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table AS SELECT now();
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

The following result set is returned:

```sql
SELECT 1
              now

The following instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres and running ad-hoc queries. For more information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

<Admonition type="note">
A Neon compute instance runs Postgres, which means that any Postgres application or standard utility such as `psql` is compatible with Neon. You can also use Postgres client libraries and drivers to connect. However, please be aware that some older client libraries and drivers, including older `psql` executables, are built without [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/docs/reference/glossary#sni) support and require a workaround. For more information, see [Connection errors](/docs/connect/connection-errors).

Neon also provides a passwordless auth feature that uses `psql`. For more information, see [Passwordless auth](/docs/connect/passwordless-connect).
</Admonition>

The easiest way to connect to Neon using `psql` is with a connection string.

You can obtain a connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

From your terminal or command prompt, run the `psql` client with the connection string copied from the Neon **Dashboard**.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]

Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties. Neon rejects connections that do not use SSL/TLS, behaving in the same way as standalone Postgres with only `hostssl` records in a `pg_hba.conf` configuration file.

However, there are different levels of protection when using SSL/TLS encryption, which you can configure by appending an `sslmode` parameter to your connection string.

## Connection modes

When connecting to Neon or any Postgres database, the `sslmode` parameter setting determines the security of the connection. You can append the `sslmode` parameter to your Neon connection string as shown:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=verify-full
```

</CodeBlock>

Neon supports the following `sslmode` settings, in order of least to most secure.

| sslmode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| require | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. If verification fails, the connection is refused. |
| verify-ca | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). |
| verify-full | Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is fully verified, including hostname verification, expiration checks, and revocation checks. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). |

The choice of which mode to use depends on the specific security requirements of the application and the level of risk that you are willing to tolerate. Neon recommends that you always use `verify-full` mode, which ensures the highest level of security and protects against a wide range of attacks including man-in-the-middle attacks. The following sections describe how to configure connections using `verify-full` mode.

The required configuration for your connection depends on the client you are using.

## Connect from the psql client

To connect from the `psql` command-line client with `sslmode=verify-full`, provide the path to your system root certificates by setting the `PGSSLROOTCERT` variable to the location of your operating system's root certificates. You can set this environment variable in your shell, typically bash or similar, using the export command. For example, if your root certificate is at `/path/to/root.crt`, you would set the variable like so:

```bash
export PGSSLROOTCERT="/path/to/your/root.crt"
```

Refer to [Location of system root certificates](#location-of-system-root-certificates) below to find the path to system root certificates for your operating system.

## Connect from other clients

If the client application uses a popular Postgres client library, such as `psycopg2` for Python or JDBC for Java, the library typically provides built-in support for SSL/TLS encryption and verification, allowing you to configure an `sslmode` setting in the connection parameters. For example:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname='dbname',
    user='alex',
    password='AbC123dEf',
    host='ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech',
    port='5432',
    sslmode='verify-full',
    sslrootcert='/path/to/your/root.crt'
)
```

However, if your client application uses a non-standard Postgres client, SSL/TLS may not be enabled by default. In this case, you must manually configure the client to use SSL/TLS and specify an `sslmode` configuration. Refer to the client or the client's driver documentation for how to configure the path to your operating system's root certificates.

### Location of system root certificates

Neon uses public root certificates issued by [Letâs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). These certificates are usually available in a root store on your operating system. A root store is a collection of pre-downloaded root certificates from various Certificate Authorities (CAs). These are highly trusted CAs, and their certificates are typically shipped with operating systems and some applications.

The location of the root store varies by operating system or distribution. Here are some locations where you might find the required root certificates on popular operating systems:

- Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc.

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ```

- CentOS, Fedora, RedHat

  ```bash
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
  ```

- OpenSUSE

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
  ```
  
- Alpine Linux

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  ```

- Android

  ```bash
  /system/etc/security/cacerts
  ```

- macOS:

  ```bash
  /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  ```

- Windows

  Windows does not provide a file containing the CA roots that can be used by your driver. However, many popular programming languages used on Windows like C#, Java, or Go do not require the CA root path to be specified and will use the Windows internal system roots by default.

  However, if you are using a language that requires specifying the CA root path, such as C or PHP, you can obtain a bundle of root certificates from the Mozilla CA Certificate program provided by the Curl project. You can download the bundle at [https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html). After downloading the file, you will need to configure your driver to point to the bundle.

The system root certificate locations listed above may differ depending on the version, distribution, and configuration of your operating system. If you do not find the root certificates in these locations, refer to your operating system documentation.

Neon uses [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) to offer support for connection pooling, enabling up to 10,000 concurrent connections. PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for Postgres.

This topic describes Neon's default connection limits, how connection pooling works, and how you can enable connection pooling for your applications.

## Default connection limits

Each Postgres connection creates a new process in the operating system, which consumes resources. Postgres limits the number of open connections for this reason. The Postgres connection limit is defined by the `max_connections` parameter.

In Neon, the size of your compute determines the `max_connections` setting. The formula used to calculate `max_connections` is `RAM in bytes / 9531392 bytes`. For a Neon Free Tier compute, which has 1 GB of RAM, this works out to approximately 100 connections. Larger computes offered with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) have more RAM and therefore support a larger number of connections. For example, a compute with 12 GB of RAM supports 1351 connections. You can check the `max_connections` limit for your compute by running the following query from the Neon SQL Editor or a client connected to Neon:

```sql
SHOW max_connections;
```

Even with the largest compute size, the `max_connections` limit may not be sufficient for some applications, such as those that use serverless functions. To increase the number of connections that Neon supports, you can use _connection pooling_. All Neon plans, including the [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier), support connection pooling.

## Connection pooling

Some applications open numerous connections, with most eventually becoming inactive. This behavior can often be attributed to database driver limitations, running many instances of an application, or applications with serverless functions. With regular Postgres, new connections are rejected when reaching the `max_connections` limit. To overcome this limitation, Neon supports connection pooling using [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), which allows Neon to support up to 10,000 concurrent connections.

PgBouncer is an open-source connection pooler for Postgres. When an application needs to connect to a database, PgBouncer provides a connection from the pool. Connections in the pool are routed to a smaller number of actual Postgres connections. When a connection is no longer required, it is returned to the pool and is available to be used again. Maintaining a pool of available connections improves performance by reducing the number of connections that need to be created and torn down to service incoming requests. Connection pooling also helps avoid rejected connections. When all connections in the pool are being used, PgBouncer queues a new request until a connection from the pool becomes available.

Neon uses `PgBouncer` in `transaction mode`. For limitations associated with `transaction mode`, see [Connection pooling notes and limitations](#connection-pooling-notes-and-limitations). For more information about `PgBouncer`, refer to [https://www.pgbouncer.org/](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).

## Enable connection pooling

Enabling connection pooling in Neon requires adding a `-pooler` suffix to the compute endpoint ID, which is part of the Neon hostname. Connections that specify the `-pooler` suffix in the connection string use a pooled connection.

You can add the `-pooler` suffix to the endpoint ID in your connection string as shown:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

</CodeBlock>

The **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** provides **Pooled connection** checkbox that adds the `-pooler` option to a connection string that you can copy and paste.

![Connection Details pooled connection string](/docs/connect/connection_details_pooled.png)

## Neon PgBouncer configuration settings

Neon's PgBouncer configuration is shown below. The settings are not user-configurable.

```ini
[pgbouncer]
pool_mode=transaction
max_client_conn=10000
default_pool_size=64
max_prepared_statements=0
query_wait_timeout=120
```

The following list describes each setting. For a full explanation of each parameter, please refer to the official [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html).

- `pool_mode=transaction`: The pooling mode PgBouncer uses, set to `transaction` pooling.
- `max_client_conn=10000`: Maximum number of client connections allowed.
- `default_pool_size=64`: Default number of server connections to allow per user/database pair.
- `max_prepared_statements=0`: Maximum number of prepared statements a connection is allowed to have at the same time. `0` means prepared statements are disabled.
- `query_wait_timeout=120`: Maximum time queries are allowed to spend waiting for execution. Neon uses the default setting of `120` seconds.

## Connection pooling notes and limitations

Neon uses PgBouncer in _transaction mode_, which does not support Postgres features such as prepared statements or [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-listen.html)/[NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-notify.html). For a complete list of limitations, refer to the "_SQL feature map for pooling modes_" section in the [pgbouncer.org Features](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html) documentation.

## The endpoint ID is not specified

With older clients and some native Postgres clients, you may receive the following error when attempting to connect to Neon:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```txt
ERROR: The endpoint ID is not specified. Either upgrade the Postgres client library (libpq) for SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (the first part of the domain name) as a parameter: '&options=endpoint%3D'. See [https://neon.tech/sni](https://neon.tech/sni) for more information.
```

</CodeBlock>

This error occurs if your client library or application does not support the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** mechanism in TLS.

Neon uses compute endpoint IDs (the first part of a Neon domain name) to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer domain name information, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this.

SNI support was added to the `libpq` (the official Postgres client library) in version 14, which was released in September 2021. Clients that use your system's `libpq` library should work if you `libpq` version is >= 14. On Linux and macOS, you can check your `libpq` version by running `pg_config --version`. On Windows, check the `libpq.dll` version in your Postgres installation's `bin` directory. Right click on the file, select **Properties** > **Details**.  

If a library or application upgrade does not help, there are several workarounds, described below, for providing the required domain name information when connecting to Neon.

### A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option

Neon supports a connection option named `endpoint`, which you can use to identify the compute endpoint you are connecting to. Specifically, you can add `options=endpoint%3D[endpoint_id]` as a parameter to your connection string, as shown in the example below. The `%3D` is a URL-encoded `=` sign. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```txt
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?options=endpoint%3D[endpoint-id]
```

</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="note">
The `endpoint` connection option was previously named `project`. The `project` option is deprecated but remains supported for backward compatibility.
</Admonition>

The `endpoint` option works if your application or library permits it to be set. Not all of them do, especially in the case of GUI applications.

### B. Use libpq key=value syntax in the database field

If your application or client is based on `libpq` but you cannot upgrade the library, such as when the library is compiled inside of a an application, you can take advantage of the fact that `libpq` permits adding options to the database name. So, in addition to the database name, you can specify the `endpoint` option, as shown below. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

```txt
dbname=neondb options=endpoint=[endpoint_id]
```

### C. Set verify-full for golang-based clients

If your application or service uses golang Postgres clients like `pgx` and `lib/pg`, you can set `sslmode=verify-full`, which causes SNI information to be sent when you connect. Most likely, this behavior is not intended but happens inadvertently due to the golang's TLS library API design.

### D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field

Another supported workaround involves specifying the endpoint ID in the password field. So, instead of specifying only your password, you provide a string consisting of the `endpoint` option and your password, separated by a semicolon (`;`) or dollar sign character (`$`), as shown in the examples below. Replace `[endpoint_id]` with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this: `ep-cool-darkness-123456`.

```txt
endpoint=<endpoint_id>;<password>
```

or

```txt
endpoint=<endpoint_id>$<password>
```

<Admonition type="note">
Using a dollar sign (`$`) character as a separator may be required if a semicolon (`;`) is not a permitted character in a password field. For example, the [AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) does not permit a semicolon character in the **Password** field when defining connection details for database endpoints.
</Admonition>

This approach causes the authentication method to be downgraded from `scram-sha-256` (never transfers a plain text password) to `password` (transfers a plain text password). However, the connection is still TLS-encrypted, so the level of security is equivalent to the security provided by `https` websites. We intend deprecate this option when most libraries and applications provide SNI support.

### Libraries

Clients on the [list of drivers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/List_of_drivers) on the PostgreSQL community wiki that use your system's `libpq` library should work if your `libpq` version is >= 14.

Neon has tested the following drivers for SNI support:

## Password authentication failed for user

The following error is often the result of an incorrectly defined connection information, or the driver you are using does not support Server Name Indication (SNI).

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
ERROR:  password authentication failed for user '<user_name>' connection to server at "ep-billowing-fun-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech" (12.345.67.89), port 5432 failed: ERROR:  connection is insecure (try using `sslmode=require`)
```

</CodeBlock>

Check your connection to see if it is defined correctly. Your Neon connection string can be obtained from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. It appears similar to this:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

</CodeBlock>

For clients or applications that require specifying connection parameters such as user, password, and hostname separately, the values in a Neon connection string correspond to the following:

- **User**: `daniel`
- **Password**: `f74wh99w398H`
- **Hostname**: `ep-white-morning-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- **Port number**: `5432` (Neon uses default Postgres port, `5432`, and is therefore not included in the connection string)
- **Database name**: `neondb` (`neondb` is the ready-to-use database created with each Neon project. Your database name may differ.)

If you find that your connection string is defined correctly, see the instructions regarding SNI support outlined in the preceding section: [The endpoint ID is not specified](#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified).

## Couldn't connect to compute node

This error arises when the Neon proxy, which accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol, fails to establish a connection with your compute. This issue sometimes occurs due to repeated connection attempts during the compute's restart phase after it has been idle due to [Auto-suspension](/docs/reference/glossary#auto-suspend-compute) (scale to zero). Currently, the transition from an idle state to an active one takes a few seconds.

Consider these recommended steps:

- Visit the [Neon status page](https://neonstatus.com/) to ensure there are no ongoing issues.
- Pause for a short period to allow your compute to restart, then try reconnecting.
- Try [connecting with psql](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) to see if a connection can be established.
- Review the strategies in [Connection latency and timeouts](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-latency) for avoiding connection issues due to compute startup time.

If the connection issue persists, please reach out to [Support](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/support).

## Can't reach database server

This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Client with Neon.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
```

</CodeBlock>

A compute node in Neon has two main states: **Active** and **Idle**. Active means that Postgres is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, the activity monitor gracefully places the compute node into an idle state to save energy and resources.

When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds. If the error above is reported, it most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before your Neon compute was activated. For dealing with this connection timeout scenario, refer to the [connection timeout](/docs/guides/prisma#connection-timeouts) instructions in our Prisma documentation. Our [connection latency and timeout](/docs/connect/connection-latency) documentation may also be useful in addressing this issue.

## Error undefined: Database error

This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Migrate with Neon.

```text
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
```

Prisma Migrate requires a direct connection to the database. It does not support a pooled connection with PgBouncer, which is the connection pooler used by Neon. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as `prisma migrate dev`, with a pooled connection causes this error. To resolve this issue, please refer to our [Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate](/docs/guides/prisma#connect-pooling-with-prisma-migrate) instructions.

## Terminating connection due to administrator command

The `terminating connection due to administrator command` error is typically encountered when running a query from a connection that has sat idle long enough for the compute endpoint to suspend due to inactivity. Neon automatically suspends a compute endpoint after 5 minutes of inactivity, by default. You can reproduce this error by connecting to your database from an application or client such as `psql`, letting the connection remain idle until the compute suspends, and then running a query from the same connection.

If you encounter this error, you can try adjusting the timing of your query or reestablishing the connection before running the query. Alternatively, if you are a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) user, you can disable auto-suspend or configure a different suspension period. For instructions, see [Configuring Auto-suspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).  [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users cannot modify the default 5 minute auto-suspend setting.

Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature ('scale to zero') is designed to minimize costs by automatically scaling a compute resource down to zero after a period of inactivity. By default, Neon scales a compute to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity. A characteristic of this feature is the concept of a "cold start". During this process, a compute instance transitions from an idle state to an active state to process requests. Currently, activating a Neon compute from an idle state takes anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds not counting other factors that can add to latencies such as the physical distance between your application and database or startup times of other services that participate in your connection process.

Cold-start times are fastest in the `US East (Ohio) â aws-us-east-2` region, which hosts the Neon Control Plane. The Neon Control plane will be deployed regionally in future Neon releases, bringing the same millesecond cold-start times to all supported regions.

<Admonition type="note">
Services you integrate with Neon may also have startup times, which can add to connection latencies. This topic does not address latencies of other vendors, but if your application connects to Neon via another service, remember to consider startup times for those services as well.
</Admonition>

## Check the status of a compute

You can check the current status of a compute on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute will report either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

![Compute endpoint status](/docs/connect/compute_endpoint_state.png)

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="info">
The Neon API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
</Admonition>

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it changes from an **Idle** to an **Active** state. By default, a compute is suspended after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure this delay period, which is described later in this topic.

## Strategies for managing latency and timeouts

Given the potential impact on application responsiveness, it's important to have strategies in place for managing connection latencies and timeouts. Here are some methods you can implement:

- [Adjust your Auto-suspend (scale to zero) configuration](#adjust-your-auto-suspend-scale-to-zero-configuration)
- [Place your application and database in the same region](#place-your-application-and-database-in-the-same-region)
- [Increase your connection timeout](#increase-your-connection-timeout)
- [Build connection timeout handling into your application](#build-connection-timeout-handling-into-your-application)
- [Use application-level caching](#use-application-level-caching)

### Adjust your Auto-suspend (scale to zero) configuration

With the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan), you can configure the length of time that the system remains in an inactive state before Neon scales your compute down to zero. This lets you set the balance between performance (never scaling down) and cost (scaling to zero at reasonable intervals). The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting is set to 5 minutes by default. You can disable Auto-suspend entirely or set a custom period up to a maximum of 7 days. Limiting or disabling autosuspend can eliminate or reduce startup times, but it also increases compute usage. For configuration instructions, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

Consider combining this strategy with Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature (available with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan)), which allows you to run a compute with minimal resources and scale up on demand. For example, with _Autoscaling_, you can configure a minimum compute size to reduce costs during off-peak times. In the image shown below, the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** is set to 1 hour so that your compute only suspends after an hour of inactivity, and _Autoscaling_ is configured with the 1/4 minimum compute size to keep costs low during periods of inactivity or light usage.

![Connection warmup Auto-suspend and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/connect/cold_start_compute_config.png)

To determine what an "always-on" compute would cost per month, please refer to our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) documentation or the [pricing calculator](/calculator).

For Autoscaling configuration instructions, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

### Place your application and database in the same region

A key strategy for reducing connection latency is ensuring that your application and database are hosted in the same region, or as close as possible, geographically. For the regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions). For information about moving your database to a different region, see [Import data from another Neon project](/docs/import/import-from-neon).

### Increase your connection timeout

By configuring longer connection timeout durations, your application has more time to accommodate cold starts and other factors that contribute to latency.

Connection timeout settings are typically configured in your application or the database client library you're using, and the specific way to do it depends on the language or framework you're using.

Here are examples of how to increase connection timeout settings in a few common programming languages and frameworks:

<CodeTabs labels={["Node.js", "Python", "Java", "Prisma" ]}>

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg')

const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000, // connection timeout in milliseconds
    idleTimeoutMillis: 10000 // idle timeout in milliseconds
})
```

```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import connect
from psycopg2.extensions import ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT
import os

DATABASE_URL = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL, connect_timeout=10)
```

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.util.Properties;

String dbUrl = System.getenv("DATABASE_URL");
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty("connectTimeout", "10");

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, properties);
```

```prisma
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?connect_timeout=15&pool_timeout=15`
```

</CodeTabs>

<Admonition type="note">
If you are using Prisma Client, your timeout issue could be related to Prisma's connection pool configuration. The Prisma Client query engine instantiates its own connection pool when it opens a first connection to the database. If you encounter a `Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool` error, refer to [Prisma connection pool timeouts](/docs/guides/prisma#connection-pool-timeouts) for information about configuring your Prisma connection pool size and pool timeout settings.
</Admonition>

Remember that increasing connection timeout settings might impact the responsiveness of your application, and users could end up waiting longer for their requests to be processed. Always test and monitor your application's performance when making changes like these.

### Build connection timeout handling into your application

You can prepare your application to handle connection timeouts when latency is unavoidable. This might involve using retries with exponential backoff. This Javascript example connects to the database using the `pg` library and uses the `node-retry` library to handle connection retries with an exponential backoff. The general logic can be easily translated into other languages.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
var Client = require('pg').Client;
var retry = require('retry');

// Connection string from .env file
var connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL;

function connectWithRetry() {
  var operation = retry.operation({
    retries: 5,               // number of retries before giving up
    minTimeout: 4000,         // minimum time between retries in milliseconds
    randomize: true,          // adds randomness to timeouts to prevent retries from overwhelming the server
  });

  operation.attempt(function (currentAttempt) {
    var client = new Client({ connectionString });

    client.connect()
      .then(function() {
        console.log('Connected to the database');
        
        // Perform your operations with the client
        // For example, let's run a simple SELECT query
        return client.query('SELECT NOW()');
      })
      .then(function(res) {
        console.log(res.rows[0]);
        
        return client.end();
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        if (operation.retry(err)) {
          console.warn(`Failed to connect on attempt ${currentAttempt}, retrying...`);
        } else {
          console.error('Failed to connect to the database after multiple attempts:', err);
        }
      });
  });
}

// Usage
connectWithRetry();
```

In the example above, the `operation.attempt` function initiates the connection logic. If the connection fails (i.e., `client.connect()` returns a rejected Promise), the error is passed to `operation.retry`(err). If there are retries left, the retry function schedules another attempt with a delay based on the parameters defined in the `retry.operation`. The delay between retries is controlled by the `minTimeout` and `randomize` options.

The randomize option adds a degree of randomness to the delay to prevent a large number of retries from potentially overwhelming the server. The `minTimeout` option defines the minimum time between retries in milliseconds.

However, this example is a simplification. In a production application, you might want to use a more sophisticated strategy. For example, you could initially attempt to reconnect quickly in the event of a transient network issue, then fall back to slower retries if the problem persists.

### Use application-level caching

Implement a caching system like [Redis](https://redis.io/) or [PolyScale](https://www.polyscale.ai/) to store frequently accessed data, which can be rapidly served to users. This approach can help reduce occurrences of latency, but only if the data requested is available in the cache. Challenges with this strategy include cache invalidation due to frequently changing data, and cache misses when queries request uncached data. This strategy will not avoid latency entirely, but you may be able to combine it with other strategies to improve application responsiveness overall.

## Conclusion

With the right strategies, you can optimize your system to handle connection latencies and timeouts, ensuring your application delivers a consistently high level of performance. The best solution often involves a combination of strategies, so experiment and find the right configuration for your specific use case.

```

## Neon account

This is the account you used to sign up with Neon. Neon supports signing up with an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account.

## API keys

API keys are global and belong to the Neon account. API keys are used with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to create and manage Neon projects or objects within a Neon project. A Neon account can create unlimited API keys. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## Projects

A project is the top-level object in the Neon object hierarchy. It is a container for all other objects, with the exception of API keys, which are global. Branches and compute endpoints belong to a project. A Neon project defines the region where project resources reside. A Neon account can have multiple projects, but tier limits define the number of projects per Neon account. For more information, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).

## Branches

Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a primary branch called `main`. You can create child branches from `main` or from previously created branches. A branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Tier limits define the number of branches you can create in a project and the amount of data per branch. For more information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).

## Compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is a compute resource associated with a branch. A read-write compute endpoint is created for a project's primary branch, by default. Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints. You can choose whether or not to create a compute endpoint when creating a branch. To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint that is associated with the branch. Tier limits define the resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. For more information, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints).

## Roles

In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. A role is required to create and access a database. A role belongs to a branch. There is no limit on the number of roles you can create. The primary branch of a Neon project is created with a role named for the Neon account that you registered with. For example, if you registered with a Google account for "Casey Smith", Neon creates a role named "Casey" in the primary branch. This role is the owner of the ready-to-use `neondb` database in your project's primary branch. For more information, see [Manage roles](/docs/manage/roles).

## Databases

As with any standalone instance of Postgres, a database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch. The primary branch of a Neon project is created with a ready-to-use database named `neondb`. There is no limit on the number of databases you can create. For more information, see [Manage databases](/docs/manage/databases).

Most actions performed in the Neon Console can be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Using the Neon API requires an API key. This topic describes how to generate, revoke, and use API keys.

API keys are global and belong to your Neon account. They can be used with any project that belongs to your Neon account. A Neon account can create unlimited API keys.

## Create an API key

An API key (or token) is a randomly-generated 64-bit key that you must provide when calling Neon API methods. An API key remains valid until it is revoked.

To generate an API key:

1. Log in to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Click your account in the bottom left corner of the Neon Console, and select **Account**.
3. Select **Developer Settings** and click **Generate new API Key**.
4. Enter a name for the API key.
5. Click **Create** and copy the generated key.

Store your key in a safe location. You will not be able to view or copy the key again after leaving the **Developer Settings** page. You can safely store an API key in a locally installed credential manager or in a credential management service such as the [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). If you lose an API key, revoke it and generate a new one.

## Revoke an API key

An API key that is no longer needed can be revoked. This action cannot be reversed.

To revoke an API key:

1. Click your account in the bottom left corner of the Neon Console and select **Account**.
2. Select **Developer Settings** to see a list of API keys.
3. To revoke a key, click **Revoke**. The key is immediately revoked. Any request that uses the key now fails.

## Make an API call

The following `cURL` example uses the `/projects` endpoint to retrieve projects that belong to your Neon account.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' | jq
```

where:

- `"https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects"` is the resource URL, which includes the base URL for the Neon API and the `/projects` endpoint.
- The `"Accept: application/json"` in the header specifies the accepted response type.
- The `Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY` entry in the header specifies your API key. Replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual 64-bit API key. A request without this header, or containing an invalid or revoked API key, fails and returns a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code.
- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read.

<details>
<summary>Response body</summary>

    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) for other supported Neon API methods.

## Manage API keys with the Neon API

API key actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and revoke API keys using the Neon API.

### Prerequisites

You can create and manage API keys using the Neon API, but you need an API key to start with. You can obtain an API key from the Neon Console. For instructions, see [Create an API key](#create-an-api-key). In the examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Create an API key with the API

The following Neon API method creates an API key. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createapikey).

```text
POST /api_keys 
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. You must specify the `key_name` attribute and a name for the API key.

```bash
curl https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/api_keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"key_name": "mynewkey"}' | jq
```

The response body includes an `id` for the key and a generated 64-bit `key` value, which can be used to access the Neon API. API keys should stored and managed securely, as they provide access to all objects in your Neon account.

With Neon, everything starts with the project. It is the top-level object in the [Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview). A project can hold as many databases, and with the Neon Pro Plan, as many branches of those databases, as your application or workflow needs. However, [tier limits](/docs/introduction/plans) define how many projects you can create. The Neon Free Tier limits you to one project per Neon account.

Learn more about projects and how to manage them in these sections:

- [Default resources](#default-resources)
- [Project Settings](#about-the-settings-page)
- [Basic actions](#basic-actions)
- [Advanced settings](#advanced-settings)
- [Manage projects from the API](#manage-projects-with-the-neon-api)

## Default resources

When you add a new project, Neon creates the following resources by default:

- A primary branch called `main`. You can create child branches from the primary branch or from any previously created branch. For more information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).
- A single read-write compute endpoint. This is the compute instance associated with the branch. For more information, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints).
- A ready-to-use database, called `neondb`, which lives in the project's primary branch.
- A default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the email, Google, GitHub, or partner account that you registered with).

## About the Settings page

Once you open a project, you can use the **Settings** page to manage that particular project and configure any defaults.

![Project Settings page](/docs/manage/settings_page.png)

You can tab between these sections:

- **General** &#8212; Change the name of your project or copy the project ID.
- **Compute** &#8212; Set the auto-suspend and sizing defaults for any new compute instances you create when branching.
- **Storage** &#8212; Choose how long Neon maintains a history of changes for all branches.
- **Sharing** &#8212; Let other users access your project's databases.
- **Delete** &#8212; Use with care! This action deletes your entire project and all its objects, and is irreversible.

## Basic actions

Here are some basic actions you can take to add or manage projects:

- [Create a project](#create-a-project)
- [View projects](#view-projects)
- [Change a project name](#change-the-name-or-copy-the-id-of-your-project)
- [Delete a project](#delete-a-project)
- [Share a project](#share-a-project)

### Create a project

The following instructions describe how to create additional Neon projects. If you are creating your very first Neon project, refer to the instructions in [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up). Neon Free Tier users are limited to a single Neon project. Support for multiple projects is only available to [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify values for **Name**, **Postgres version**, and **Region**. Project names are limited to 64 characters. If you are a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) user, you can specify **Compute size** settings when creating a project. The settings you specify become the default settings for compute endpoints that you add to your project when creating [branches](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch) or [read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide).

    - Neon supports fixed size computes and _Autoscaling_. For more information, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
    - The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
  
4. Click **Create Project**.

After creating a project, you are presented with a dialog that provides your connection details for a ready-to-use `neondb` database. The connection details include your password.

### View projects

To view your projects:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select **Home** or the Neon logo at the top left of the Console.
1. The **Projects** page lists your projects, including any projects that have been shared with you.

### Change the name or copy the ID of your project

You are permitted to change the name of your project at any point. The project ID is permanent.

To edit a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to edit.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **General**.
5. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Delete a project

Deleting a project is a permanent action, which also deletes any compute endpoints, branches, databases, and roles that belong to the project.

To delete a project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to delete.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **Delete**.
5. Click **Delete project.**
6. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

### Share a project

Project sharing is a Neon Pro Plan feature that allows you to share your project with other Neon accounts.

To share a project:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Sharing**.
1. Under **Grant access to your project**, enter the email address of the account you want to share access with.
1. Click **Grant access**.

The email you specify is added to the list of **People who have access to the project**. The Neon account associated with that email address is granted full access to the project with the exception privileges required to delete the project. When that user logs in to Neon, the shared project is listed on their **Projects** page, under **Shared with me**.

The costs associated with a shared project are charged to the Neon account that owns the project. For example, if you were to share your project with another Neon user account, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Neon account, not theirs.

For additional information, refer to our [Project sharing guide](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

## Advanced settings

From the **Settings** page, you can also set defaults or apply bulk changes across your Neon objects:

- [Reset default compute size](#reset-the-default-compute-size) (Neon Pro Plan only)
- [Configure history retention range](#configure-history-retention)
- [Enable logical replication](#enable-logical-replication)
- [Configiure IP Allow](#configure-ip-allow)

### Reset the default compute size

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU is equal to 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. Currently, a Neon compute endpoint can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. Larger compute sizes will be supported in a future release.

For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, Neon sets your compute size to a static shared 1 vCPU, with 1 GB of RAM for each branch (max 10 branches).

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users have the flexibility to choose a compute size for each branch's compute endpoint individually. By default, new branches inherit the compute endpoint size from your first branch (i.e., `main`). However, there may be times when you want to reset this default. For example, if you want to create a series of read-only replicas, where each replica typically requires less compute per branch.

To reset the default compute size, go to **Settings** > **Compute**.

You can choose from two options:

- **Fixed Size:** Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries in response to the current load. Currently, _Autoscaling_ supports a range of 1/4 (.25) CU to 7 CUs. The 1/4 CU and 1/2 CU settings are _shared compute_. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

_Example: default minimum and maximum autoscale settings_

![Default autoscaling min and max](/docs/manage/default_autoscale.png)

### Configure history retention

By default, Neon retains a 7-day history of changes for all branches in a Neon project, which allows you to create a branch that restores data to any point within the defined retention period. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. Please be aware that increasing the history retention period affects all branches in your project and increases [project storage](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

To configure the history retention period for a project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Storage**.
    ![History retention configuration](/docs/relnotes/history_retention.png)
4. Use the slider to select the history retention period.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enable logical replication

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon databases to a variety of external destinations, including data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases.

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication for your project:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level 
-----------
logical
```

After enabling logical replication, the next steps involve creating publications on your replication source database in Neon and configuring subscriptions on the destination system or service. To get started, refer to our [logical replication guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

### Configure IP Allow

Available to [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users, the IP Allow feature provides an added layer of security for your data, restricting access to the branch where your database resides to only those IP addresses that you specify. In Neon, the IP allowlist is applied to all branches by default. Optionally, you can apply the IP allowlist to your project's [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch) only. For instance, you might want to restrict access to the primary branch to a handful of trusted IPs while allowing broader access to development branches.

By default, Neon allows IP addresses from 0.0.0.0, which means that Neon accepts connections from any IP address. Once you configure IP Allow by adding IP addresses or ranges, only those IP addresses will be allowed to access to Neon.

<Admonition type="note">
Currently, Neon only supports [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_version_4).
</Admonition>

You configure **IP Allow** for a project using the Neon Console:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **IP Allow**.
    ![IP Allow configuration](/docs/manage/ip_allow.png)
4. Specify the IP addresses you want to permit.
5. Optionally, select **Apply to primary branch only** to apply the allowlist to your project's [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch) only
5. Click **Apply changes**.

#### How to specify IP addresses

You can define an allowlist with individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). A combination of these options is also permitted. Multiple entries, whether they are the same or of different types, must be separated by a comma. Whitespace is ignored.

- **Add individual IP addresses**: You can add individual IP addresses that you want to allow. This is useful for granting access to specific users or devices. This example represents a single IP address:

  ```text
  192.168.1.15
  ```

- **Define IP ranges**: For broader access control, you can define IP ranges. This is useful for allowing access from a company network or a range of known IPs. This example range includes all IP addresses from `192.168.1.20` to `192.168.1.30`: 

  ```text
  192.168.1.20-192.168.1.30
  ```

- **Use CIDR notation**: For more advanced control, you can use [CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). This is a compact way of defining a range of IPs and is useful for larger networks or subnets. Using CIDR notation can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network.

  This CIDR notation example represents all 256 IP addresses from  `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`. 

  ```text
  192.168.1.0/24
  ```

A combined example using all three options above, specified as a comma-separated list, would appear similar to the following:

  ```text
  192.168.1.15, 192.168.1.16, 192.168.1.20-192.168.1.30, 192.168.1.0/24S
  ```

This list combines individual IP addresses, a range of IP addresses, and a CIDR block. It illustrates how different types of IP specifications can be used together in a single allowlist configuration, offering a flexible approach to access control.

## Manage projects with the Neon API

Project actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete projects using the Neon API. For other project-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a project with the API

The following Neon API method creates a project. The [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) permits one project per account. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject).

```text
POST /projects
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `myproject` name value is a user-specified name for the project.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "project": {
    "name": "myproject"
  }
}' | jq
```

The response includes information about the roles, the ready-to-use database (`neondb`), the primary branch (`main`), and the read-write compute endpoint that is created with the project.

# Branches

Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a [primary branch](#primary-branch) called `main`. You can create child branches from `main` or from previously created branches. A branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Tier limits define the number of branches you can create in a project and the amount of data you can store in a branch.

A child branch is a copy-on-write clone of the parent branch. You can modify the data in a branch without affecting the data in the parent branch.
For more information about branches and how you can use them in your development workflows, see [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching).

You can create and manage branches using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). This topic covers both methods.

<Admonition type="important">
When working with branches, it is important to remove old and unused branches. Branches hold a lock on the data they contain, preventing disk space from being reallocated. Neon retains a 7-day data history, by default. You can configure the retention period. See [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore). To keep data storage to a minimum, remove branches before they age out of the history retention window.
</Admonition>

## Primary branch

Each Neon project has a primary branch. In the Neon Console, your primary branch is identified by a `PRIMARY` tag. You can designate any branch as the primary branch for your project. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch, which is typically the branch used in production.

- For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch remains accessible if you exceed the _Active time_ limit of 100 hours per month.
- For [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. Neon has a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect your account from unintended usage.

## Non-primary branch

Any branch not designated as the primary branch is considered a non-primary branch. You can rename or delete non-primary branches.

- For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, compute endpoints associated with non-primary branches are suspended if you exceed the Neon Free Tier  _compute active time_ limit of 100 hours per month.
- For [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users, default limits prevent more than 20 simultaneously active compute endpoints. Beyond that limit, a compute endpoint associated with a non-primary branch remains suspended.

## Create a branch

To create a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
![Create branch dialog](/docs/manage/create_branch.png)
4. Enter a name for the branch.
5. Select a parent branch. You can branch from your Neon project's [primary branch](#primary-branch) or a [non-primary branch](#non-primary-branch).
6. Select an **Include data up to** option to specify the data to be included in your branch.   
    - **Current point in time**: Creates a branch with the latest available data from the parent (the default).
    - **Specific date and time**: Creates a branch with data up to a specific date and time, allowing for point-in-time restore.
    - **Specific Log Sequence Number**: Creates a branch with data up to a specific [Log Sequence Number (LSN)](/docs/reference/glossary#lsn) in the database log, allowing for precise point-in-time restore.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The **Specific date and time** and the **Specific Log Sequence Number Data** options do not include data changes that occured after the specified date and time or LSN, which means the branch contains data as it existed previously, allowing for point-in-time restore. You can only specify a date and time or LSN value that falls within your history retention window, which is 7 days by default. See [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).
    </Admonition>

8. Click **Create new branch** to create your branch.

You are directed to the **Branches** page where you are shown the details for your new branch.

## View branches

To view the branches in a Neon project:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table to view details about the branch.
![View branch details](/docs/manage/branch_details.png)

Branch details shown on the branch page include:

- **ID**: The branch ID. Branch IDs have a `br-` prefix.
- **Created**: The date and time the branch was created.
- **Current Data Size**: The current data size of the branch.
- **Active Time**: The total amount of time that your branch compute has been active within the current billing period, measured in hours.
- **Compute Time**: The computing capacity used by the branch within the current billing period, measured in Compute Unit (CU) hours.
- **Written Data**: The total volume of data written from your branch compute to storage within the current billing period, measured in gibibytes (GiB).
- **Data Transfer**: The total volume of data transferred out of Neon (known as "egress") within the current billing period, measured in (GiB).
- **Parent Branch**: The branch from which this branch was created (only visible for child branches).
- **Date**: The date the parent branch was created (only displayed for branches created with the **Time** option).
- **Time**: The time the parent branch was created (only displayed for branches created with the **Time** option).

For more information about **Active Time**, **Compute Time**, **Written Data**, and **Data Transfer** usage metrics, refer to our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) page.

The branch details page also includes details about the compute endpoint associated with the branch. For more information, see [View a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#view-a-compute-endpoint).

## Rename a branch

Neon permits renaming a branch, including your project's primary branch. To rename a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Rename**.
5. Specify a new name for the branch and click **Save**.

## Set a branch as primary

Each Neon project is created with a primary branch called `main`, but you can designate any branch as your project's primary branch. The benefit of the primary branch is that the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch remains accessible if you exceed project limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data on the primary branch. For more information, see [Primary branch](#primary-branch).

To set a branch as the primary branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Set as primary**.
5. In the **Set as primary** confirmation dialog, click **Set as Primary** to confirm your selection.

## Connect to a branch

Connecting to a database in a branch requires connecting via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following steps describe how to connect using `psql` and a connection string obtained from the Neon Console.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can also query the databases in a branch from the Neon SQL Editor. For instructions, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).
</Admonition>

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. On the project **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)
3. Copy the connection string. A connection string includes your role name, the compute endpoint hostname, and database name.
4. Connect with `psql` as shown below.

  <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

  ```bash
  psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
  ```

  </CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="tip">
A compute endpoint hostname starts with an `ep-` prefix. You can also find a compute endpoint hostname on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. See [View branches](#view-branches).
</Admonition>

If you want to connect from an application, the **Connection Details** widget on the project **Dashboard** and the [Guides](/docs/guides/guides-intro) section in the documentation provide connection examples for various languages and frameworks. For more information about connecting, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Reset a branch from parent

When working with database branches, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to update your working branch to the latest data from your main branch. For example, let's say you have two child branches `staging` and `development` forked from your `main` branch. You have been working on the `development` branch and find it is now too far out of date with `main`. You have no schema changes in `development` to consider or preserve; you just want a quick refresh of the data. With the **Reset from parent** feature, you can perform a clean reset to the latest data from the parent in a single operation, saving you the complication of manually creating and restoring branches.

<u>Key points</u>:
* You can only reset a branch to the latest data from its parent. Point-in-time resets based on timestamp or LSN are not currently supported.
* This reset is a complete override, not a refresh or a merge. Any local changes made to the child branch are lost during this reset.
* Existing connections will be temporarily interupted during the reset. However, your connection details _do not change_. All connections are re-established as soon as the reset is done.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
On the **Branches** page in the Neon Console, select the branch that you want to reset.

The console opens to the details page for your branch, giving you key information about the branch and its child status: its parent, the last time it was reset, and other relevent detail.

To reset the branch, select **Reset from parent** from either the **More** dropdown or the **Last Data Reset** panel.

![Reset from parent](/docs/manage/reset_from_parent.png)

<Admonition type="note">
If this branch has children of its own, resetting is blocked. The resulting error dialog lets you delete these child branches, after which you can continue with the reset.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Using the CLI, you can reset a branch from parent using the following command:

``` bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent
```
In the `id|name` field, specify the branch ID or name of the child branch whose data you want to reset. The `--parent` parameter specifies the kind of reset action that Neon will perform. In the future, there may be other kinds of resets available. For example, rewinding a branch to an earlier period in time.

If you have multiple projects in your account, you'll also have to include the `project-id` in the command along with the branch.

``` bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent --project-id <project id>
```

Example:
``` bash
neonctl branches reset development --parent --project-id noisy-pond-12345678
```
Alternatively, you can set the `project-id` as a background context for your CLI session, letting you perform other actions against that project without having to include the `project-id` in every command. The setting is saved in a `context-file` and remains in place until you set a new context, or you remove the `context-file`.

```bash
neonctl set-context --project-id <project id>
```
Read more about performing branching actions from the CLI in [CLI - branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches), and more about setting contexts in [CLI - set-context](/docs/reference/cli-set-context).

</TabItem>

<TabItem>
Resetting from parent is not yet directly supported from the API. However, you can use the instructions on [Refreshing a branch](/docs/guides/branch-refresh) to perform a similar operation. It involves using the API to create a new branch, transfer the compute endpoint, deleting the old branch, and (optionally) renaming the new branch.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Delete a branch

Deleting a branch is a permanent action. Deleting a branch also deletes the databases and roles that belong to the branch as well as the compute endpoint associated with the branch. You cannot delete a branch that has child branches. The child branches must be deleted first.

To delete a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Select a branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Delete**.
4. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Check the data size

Tier limits define the amount of data you can store in a branch. The [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) permits 3 GiB per branch. When creating a new branch, the child branch includes the data from the parent branch. For example, if you have a branch with 1 GiB of data, the child branch is created with the same 1 GiB of data.

You can check the data size for a branch by viewing the `Database size` value on the branch details page (see [View branches](#view-branches)). Alternatively, you can run the following query from the Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(sum(pg_database_size(datname)))
FROM pg_database;
```

<Admonition type="info">
Neon stores data in its own internal format.
</Admonition>

## Branching with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI supports creating and managing branches. For instructions, see [Neon CLI commands â branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches). For a Neon CLI branching guide, see [Branching with the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches).

## Branching with the Neon API

Branch actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all of the attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a branch with the API

The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch).

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches 
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `endpoints` attribute creates a compute endpoint, which is required to connect to the branch. A branch can be created with or without a compute endpoint. The `branch` attribute specifies the parent branch.

<Admonition type="note">
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's primary branch, and a compute endpoint is not created.
</Admonition>

```curl
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \

    }
  ],
  "branch": {
    "parent_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433"
  }
}' | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API.
- The `parent_id` can be obtained by listing the branches for your project. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api). The `<parent_id>` is the `id` of the branch you are branching from. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. You can branch from your Neon project's primary branch or a previously created branch.

The response body includes information about the branch, the branch's compute endpoint, and the `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations that were initiated.

A single read-write compute endpoint is created for your project's [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch), by default.

To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following diagram shows the project's primary branch (`main`) and a child branch, both of which have an associated compute endpoint.

```text
Project
    |----primary branch (main) ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
             |    |
             |    |---- database (neondb)
             |
             ---- child branch ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
                            |
                            |---- database (mydb)
```

Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

Tier limits define resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. The  [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) provides a shared vCPU and up to 1 GB of RAM per compute endpoint. The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) supports larger compute sizes and _Autoscaling_.

## View a compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is associated with a branch. To view a compute endpoint, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute endpoint, it is shown on the branch page.

Compute endpoint details shown on the branch page include:

- **Id**: The compute endpoint ID.
-- **Type**: The type of compute endpoint. `R/W` (Read-write) or `R/O` (Read-only).
- **Status**: The compute endpoint status (`Active`, `Idle`, or `Stopped`).
- **Compute size**: The size of the compute endpoint. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the amount of vCPU and RAM for a compute endpoint when creating or editing a compute endpoint. Shows _Autoscaling_ minimum and maximum vCPU values if _Autoscaling_ is enabled.
- **Auto-suspend delay**: The number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Last active**: The date and time the compute was last active.

## Create a compute endpoint

You can only create a read-write compute endpoint for a branch that does not have one, but a branch can have multiple read-only compute endpoints (referred to as "read replicas"). [Read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) are a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature.

To create an endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch that does not have an endpoint
1. Click **Add compute**.
1. On the **Create compute endpoint** dialog, specify your settings and click **Create**. Selecting **Read-only** creates a [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

## Edit a compute endpoint

Neon paid plan users can edit a compute endpoint to change the [compute size](#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Auto-suspend](#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
   
   The **Edit** window opens, letting you take a range of actions, depending on your tier.
1. Once you've made your changes, click **Save**. All changes take immediate effect.

### What happens to the endpoint when making changes
Some key points to understand about how your endpoint responds when you make changes to your compute settings:

* Changing the size of your fixed compute restarts the endpoint and _temporarily disconnects all existing connections_. 
  <Admonition type="note">
  When your compute resizes automatically as part of the autoscaling feature, there are no restarts or disconnects; it just scales. 
  </Admonition>
* Editing minimum or maximum autoscaling sizes also requires a restart; existing connections are temporarily disconnected.
* Changes to autosuspend settings do not require an endpoint restart; existing connections are unaffected.

### Compute size and Autoscaling configuration

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can change compute size settings when [editing a compute endpoint](#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of CUs, as shown in the table below. Currently, a Neon compute can have anywhere from 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs.

| Compute Units | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |
| 7             | 7    | 28 GB  |

Neon supports two compute size configuration options:

- **Fixed Size:** This option allows you to select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries to meet workload demand. _Autoscaling_ currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

<Admonition type="info">
The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).
</Admonition>

### Auto-suspend configuration

Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this delay can be adjusted. For instance, you can increase the delay to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable _Auto-suspend_ completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute endpoint but is likely to increase your compute time usage.

The maximum **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting is 7 days. To configure a compute as "always-active", deselect **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity**. For more information, refer to [Configuring Auto-suspend for Neon computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

## Restart a compute endpoint

It is sometimes necessary to restart a compute endpoint. For example, if you upgrade to a Neon Pro Plan account, you may want to restart your compute endpoint to immediately apply your upgraded limits.

<Admonition type="important">
Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint interrupts any connections currently using the compute endpoint.
</Admonition>

You can restart a compute endpoint using one of the following methods:

- Stop activity on your compute endpoint (stop running queries) and wait for your compute endpoint to suspend due to inactivity. By default, Neon suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can watch the status of your compute on the **Branches** page in the Neon console. Select your branch and monitor your compute's **Status** field. Wait for it to report an `Idle` status. The compute will restart the next time it's accessed, and the status will change to `Active`. 
- Issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. You can do this directly from the [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), using the **Try It!** feature. You'll need an [API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- Neon Pro Plan users can temporarily set a compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second to initiate a restart (the default setting is 5 minutes). See [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions.

## Delete a compute endpoint

Deleting a compute endpoint is a permanent action.

To delete a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API

Compute endpoint actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete compute endpoints using the Neon API. For other compute endpoint API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method creates a compute endpoint.

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The branch you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint. Neon  supports read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are for creating [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

# Roles

In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. Each Neon project is created with a default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the email, GitHub, Google, or partner account that you registered with). This role owns the ready-to-use database (`neondb`) that is created in your Neon project's primary branch.

Your default Postgres role and roles created in the Neon console, API, and CLI are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neon_superuser-role) role. Roles created with SQL from clients like [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) are only granted the basic [public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

<Admonition type="note">
Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres `superuser` account like you can in a standalone Postgres installation.
</Admonition>

You can create roles in a project's primary branch or child branches. There is no limit to the number of roles you can create.

In Neon, roles belong to a branch, which could be your main branch or a child branch. When you create a child branch, roles in the parent branch are duplicated in the child branch. For example, if role `alex` exists in the parent branch, role `alex` is copied to the child branch when the child branch is created. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that only includes data up to a particular point in time. If the role was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.

Neon supports creating and managing roles from the following interfaces:

- [Neon console](#manage-roles-in-the-neon-console)
- [Neon CLI](#manage-roles-with-the-neon-cli)
- [Neon API](#manage-roles-with-the-neon-api)
- [SQL](#manage-roles-with-sql)

## The neon_superuser role

Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. Users cannot login as `neon_superuser`, but they inherit the privileges assigned to this role. The privileges and predefined role memberships granted to `neon_superuser` include:

- `CREATEDB`: Provides the ability to create databases.
- `CREATEROLE`: Provides the ability to create new roles (which also means it can alter and drop roles).
- `BYPASSRLS`: Provides the ability to bypass row-level security (RLS) policies. This attribute is only included in `neon_superuser` roles in projects created after the [August 15, 2023 release](/docs/changelog/2023-08-15-storage-and-compute).
- `REPLICATION`: Provides the ability to connect to a Postgres server in replication mode and create or drop replication slots.
- `NOLOGIN`: The role cannot be used to log in to the Postgres server. Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system directly.
- `pg_read_all_data`: A predefined role in Postgres that provides the ability to read all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having `SELECT` rights on those objects, and `USAGE` rights on all schemas.
- `pg_write_all_data`: A predefined role in Postgres that provides the ability to write all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` rights on those objects, and `USAGE` rights on all schemas.
- `EXECUTE` privilege on the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function that is part of the `pg_stat_statements` extension.

You can think of roles with `neon_superuser` privileges as administrator roles. If you require roles with limited privileges, such as a read-only role, you can create those roles from an SQL client. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

<Admonition type="note">
Creating a database with the `neon_superuser` role, altering a database to have owner `neon_superuser`, and altering the `neon_superuser role` itself are _not_ permitted. This `NOLOGIN` role is not intended to be used directly or modified.
</Admonition>

## Manage roles in the Neon console

This section describes how to create, view, and delete roles in the Neon Console. All roles created in the Neon console are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neon_superuser-role) role.

### Create a role

To create a role:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name. The length of the role name is limited to 63 bytes.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

<Admonition type="note">
Role names cannot exceed 63 characters, and some names are not permitted. See [Protected role names](#protected-role-names).
</Admonition>

### Delete a role

Deleting a role is a permanent action that cannot be undone, and you cannot delete a role that owns a database. The database must be deleted before you can deleting the role that owns the database.

To delete a role:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select a branch to view roles in the branch.
5. Click the delete icon for the role you want to delete.
6. On the delete role dialog, click **Delete**.

### Reset a password

To reset a role's password:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select a branch to view roles in the branch.
5. Select **Reset password**.
6. On the confirmation dialog, click **Sure, reset**. A reset password dialog is displayed with your new password.

<Admonition type="note">
Resetting a password in the Neon Console resets the password to a generated value. To set your own password value, you can reset the password using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or an SQL client like [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) with the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

For password requirements, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).
</Admonition>

## Manage roles with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI supports creating and deleting roles. For instructions, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](/docs/reference/cli-roles). Roles created with the Neon CLI are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neon_superuser-role) role.

## Manage roles with the Neon API

Role actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using Neon API role methods. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, reset passwords for, and delete roles using the Neon API. For other role-related methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

Roles created with the Neon API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neon_superuser-role) role.

In Neon, roles belong to branches, which means that when you create a role, it is created in a branch. Role-related requests are therefore performed using branch API methods.

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all  attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a role with the API

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole).

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/roles
```

<Admonition type="note">
Role names cannot exceed 63 characters, and some role names are not permitted. See [Protected role names](#protected-role-names).
</Admonition>

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `project_id` and `branch_id` are required parameters, and the role `name` is a required attribute. The length of a role name is limited to 63 bytes.

## Manage roles with SQL

Roles created with SQL have the same basic `public` schema privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the [neon_superuser](#the-neon_superuser-role) role like roles created with the Neon Console, CLI, or API. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have.

To create a role with SQL, issue a `CREATE ROLE` statement from a client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

```sql
CREATE ROLE <name> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

- `WITH LOGIN` means that the role will have a login privilege, required for the role to log in to your Neon Postgres instance. If the role is used only for privilege management, the `WITH LOGIN` privilege is unnecessary.
- A password is required and must have a minimum entropy of 60 bits.

    <Admonition type="info">  
    To create a password with 60 bits of entropy, you can follow these password composition guidelines:
    - **Length**: The password should consist of at least 12 characters.
    - **Character diversity**: To enhance complexity, passwords should include a variety of character types, specifically:
      - Lowercase letters (a-z)
      - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
      - Numbers (0-9)
      - Special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
    - **Avoid predictability**: To maintain a high level of unpredictability, do not use:
      - Sequential patterns (such as '1234', 'abcd', 'qwerty')
      - Common words or phrases
      - Any words found in a dictionary
      - **Avoid character repetition**: To maximize randomness, do not use the same character more than twice consecutively.

    Example password: `T3sting!23Ab` (DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE PASSWORD)

    Passwords must be supplied in plain text but are encrypted when stored. Hashed passwords are not supported.

    The guidelines should help you create a password with approximately 60 bits of entropy. However, depending on the exact characters used, the actual entropy might vary slightly. Always aim for a longer and more complex password if you're uncertain. It's also recommended to use a trusted password manager to create and store your complex passwords safely.
    </Admonition>

For role creation and access management examples, refer to the [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access) guide.

## Protected role names

The following names are protected and cannot be given to a role:

- Any name starting with `pg_`
- `neon_superuser`
- `cloud_admin`
- `zenith_admin`
- `public`
- `none`

# Databases

updatedOn: '2023-11-24T19:55:37.127Z'
---

A database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In the [Neon object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview), a database exists within a branch of a project. There is no limit on the number of databases you can create.

A Neon project's primary branch is created with a ready-to-use database called `neondb`, which is owned by your project's default role (see [Manage roles](/docs/manage/roles) for more information). You can create your own databases in a project's primary branch or in a child branch.

All databases in Neon are created with a `public` schema. SQL objects are created in the `public` schema, by default. For more information about the `public` schema, refer to [The Public schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PUBLIC), in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.

<Admonition type="note">
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the `CREATE` privilege on a database's `public` schema. For other users, the `CREATE` privilege must be granted manually via a `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;` statement. For more information, see [Public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges).
</Admonition>

Databases belong to a branch. If you create a child branch, databases from the parent branch are copied to the child branch. For example, if database `mydb` exists in the parent branch, it will be copied to the child branch. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that includes data up to a particular point in time. If a database was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.

Neon supports creating and managing databases from the following interfaces:

- [Neon console](#manage-databases-in-the-neon-console)
- [Neon CLI](#manage-databases-with-the-neon-cli)
- [Neon API](#manage-databases-with-the-neon-api)
- [SQL](#manage-databases-with-sql)

## Manage databases in the Neon console

This section describes how to create, view, and delete databases in the Neon Console.

The role that creates a database is automatically made the owner of that database. The `neon_superuser` role is also granted all privileges on databases created in the Neon consoles. For information about this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

### Create a database

To create a database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select the branch where you want to create the database.
1. Click **New Database**.
1. Enter a database name, and select a database owner.
1. Click **Create**.

<Admonition type="note">
Some names are not permitted. See [Protected database names](#protected-database-names).
</Admonition>

### View databases

To view databases:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select a branch to view the databases in the branch.

### Delete a database

Deleting a database is a permanent action. All database objects belonging to the database such as schemas, tables, and roles are also deleted.

To delete a database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar.
1. Select a branch to view the databases in the branch.
1. For the database you want to delete, click the delete icon.
1. In the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage databases with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI supports creating and deleting databases. For instructions, see [Neon CLI commands â databases](/docs/reference/cli-databases).

## Manage databases with the Neon API

Database actions performed in the Neon Console can also be also performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete databases using the Neon API. For other database-related methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which means that when you create a database, it is created in a branch. Database-related requests are therefore performed using branch API methods.

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all  attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a database with the API

The following Neon API method creates a database. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchdatabase).

The role specified by `owner_name` is the owner of that database.

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/databases
```

<Admonition type="note">
Some names are not permitted for databases. See [Protected database names](#protected-database-names).
</Admonition>

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `project_id` and `branch_id` are required parameters, and a database `name` and `owner` are required attributes.

## Manage databases with SQL

You can create and manage databases in Neon with SQL, as you can with any standalone Postgres installation. To create a database, issue a `CREATE DATABASE` statement from a client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

Most standard [Postgres CREATE DATABASE parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) are supported with the exception of `TABLESPACE`. This parameter requires access to the local file system, which is not permitted in Neon.

The role that creates a database is the owner of the database.

<Admonition type="note">
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the `CREATE` privilege on a database's `public` schema. For other users, the `CREATE` privilege on the `public` schema must be granted explicitly via a `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;` statement. For more information, see [Public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges).
</Admonition>

For more information about database object privileges in Postgres, see [Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).

## Protected database names

The following names are protected and cannot be given to a database:

- `postgres`
- `template0`
- `template1`

# Operations

updatedOn: '2023-12-06T15:44:48.724Z'
---

An operation is an action performed by the Neon Control Plane on a Neon object or resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Other operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) after a period of inactivity or checking its availability. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status of specific operations. When working with the Neon API, you can poll the status of operations to ensure that an API request is completed before issuing the next API request. For more information, see [Poll operation status](#poll-operation-status).

| Operation | Description  |
|:---|:---|
| `apply_config` | Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating  PostgreSQL users and databases initiates this operation. |
| `apply_storage_config` | Applies a new configuration to a Neon storage object or resource. For example, updating the history retention period for a project initiates this operation.  |
| `check_availability`  | Checks the availability of data in a branch and that a [compute endpoint](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-endpoint) can start on a branch. Branches without a compute endpoint are not checked. This operation, performed by the [availability checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker), is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. |
| `create_branch`  | Creates a [branch](/docs/reference/glossary#branch) in a Neon project. For related information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).  |
| `create_timeline`  | Creates a [project](/docs/reference/glossary#project) with a primary branch.  |
| `delete_tenant`  | Deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted.  |
| `start_compute`   |Starts a compute endpoint when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute endpoint initiates this operation.  |
| `suspend_compute`  | Suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle/).  |

## View operations

You can view operations in the **Operations** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or on the **Operations** page.

![Operations](/docs/manage/operations.png)

Operation details include:

- **Action**: The action performed by the operation.
- **Branch**: The branch on which the operation was performed.
- **Status**: The status of the operation.
- **Duration**: The duration of the operation.
- **Date**: The date and time the operation occurred.

## View operations with the Neon API

The following topics are covered in this section:

- [List operations](#list-operations): Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project.
- [List operations with pagination](#list-operations-with-pagination): Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project and paginate the response.
- [Get operation](#get-operation): Describes how to retrieve the details for a specific operation by the operation ID.
- [Poll operation status](#poll-operation-status): Describes how to poll an operation for its status, which may be necessary to avoid failed requests due to in-progress operations when using the Neon API programmatically.

## Poll operation status

Some Neon API requests may take a few moments to complete. When using the Neon API programmatically, you can check the `status` of an operation before proceeding with the next API request. For example, you may want to check the operation status of a create branch request before issuing a create database request for that branch.

The response to a Neon API request includes information about the operations that were initiated. For example, a create branch request initiates `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations.

    }

  ```

You can use the [Get operation details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectoperations) method to poll the status of an operation by the operation ID. You might do this at intervals of 5 seconds until the `status` of the operation changes to `finished` before issuing the next request. For example, this request polls the `start_compute` operation shown above:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations/055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

<details>
<summary>Response body</summary>

```json
{
  "operation": {
      "id": "055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8",
      "project_id": "autumn-disk-484331",
      "branch_id": "br-dawn-scene-747675",
      "endpoint_id": "ep-small-bush-675287",
      "action": "start_compute",
      "status": "finished",
      "failures_count": 0,
      "created_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z",
      "updated_at": "2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
  }
}
```

</details>

Possible operation `status` values include `running`, `finished`, `failed`, `scheduling`. Initially, the status of an operation might be `scheduling`. Before issuing the next API request, you would poll the operation until the status changes to `finished`. You could also add logic to handle a `failed` status.

The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) allows you to share a Neon project with other Neon users.

Users that you share a project with are able to perform any action you can perform in the project, with the exception of deleting the project. For example, users you share a project with are able to:

- Create and delete branches
- Create and delete databases
- Create and delete roles
- Create and delete computes
- Modify project settings
- View data
- Run queries

You can think of sharing a Neon project as granting administrator access to your project.

## How to share a project

Sharing a project is performed from the **Settings** page in your Neon project.

Each Neon project is created with a default Postgres role that takes its name from your Neon account (the account you registered with). For example, if a user named "Alex" signs up for Neon, the project is created with a default role named `alex`.

The default Postgres role is automatically assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, and sequences. Any user created with the Neon console, Neon API, or Neon CLI is also assigned the `neon_superuser` role.

It is good practice to reserve `neon_superuser` roles for database administration tasks like creating roles and databases. For other users, we recommend creating roles with specific sets of permissions based on application and access requirements. Then, assign the appropriate roles to your users. The roles you create should adhere to a _least privilege_ model, granting only the permissions required to accomplish their tasks.

But how do you create roles with limited access? The following sections describe how to create read-only and read-write roles and assign those roles to users. We'll also look at how to create a "developer" role and grant that role full access to a database on a development branch in a Neon project.

## A word about users, groups, and roles in Postgres

In Postgres, users, groups, and roles are the same thing. From the PostgreSQL [Database Roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html) documentation:

_PostgreSQL manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. A role can be thought of as either a database user, or a group of database users, depending on how the role is set up._

Neon recommends granting privileges to roles, and then assigning those roles to your database users.

## Creating roles with limited access

You can create roles with limited access via SQL. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic [public schema privileges](#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object.

The recommended approach to creating roles with limited access is as follows:

1. Use your  default Neon role or another role with `neon_superuser` privileges to create roles for each application or use case via SQL. For example, create `readonly` and `readwrite` roles.
2. Grant privileges to those roles to allow access to database objects. For example, grant the `SELECT` privilege to a `readonly` role, or grant `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges to a `readwrite` role.
3. Create your database users. For example, create users named `readonly_user1` and `readwrite_user1`.
4. Assign the `readonly` or `readwrite` role to those users to grant them the privileges associated with those roles. For example, assign the `readonly` role to `readonly_user1`, and the `readwrite` role to `readwrite_user1`.

<Admonition type="note">
You can remove a role from a user at any time to revoke privileges. See [Revoke privileges](#revoke-privileges).
</Admonition>

## Create a read-only role

This section describes how to create a read-only role with access to a specific database and schema. An SQL statement summary is provided at the end.

<Admonition type="info">
In Postgres, access must be granted at the database, schema, and object level. For example, to grant access to a table, you must also grant access to the database and schema in which the table resides. If these access permissions are not defined, the role will not be able access the table.
</Admonition>

To create a read-only role:

1. Connect to your database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Create a `readonly` role using the following statement. A password is required.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readonly PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```
  
    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

3. Grant the `readonly` role read-only privileges on the schema. Replace `<database>` and `<schema>` with actual database and schema names, respectively.

    ```sql
    -- Grant permission to connect to the database
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readonly;

    -- Grant USAGE on the schema 
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;

    -- Grant SELECT on all existing tables in the schema
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly; 

    -- Grant SELECT on all tables added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
    ```

4. Create a database user. The password requirements mentioned above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readonly_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `readonly` role to `readonly_user1`:

    ```sql
    GRANT readonly TO readonly_user1;
    ```

    The `readonly_user1` user now has read-only access to tables in the specified schema and database and should be able to connect and run `SELECT` queries.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://readonly_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM <schema>.<table_name>;
    ```

    If the user attempts to perform an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation, a `permission denied` error is returned.

### SQL statement summary

To create the read-only role and user described above, run the following statements from an SQL client:

```sql
-- readonly role
CREATE ROLE readonly PASSWORD '<password>';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readonly;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;

-- User creation
CREATE USER readonly_user1 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT readonly TO readonly_user1;
```

## Create a read-write role

This section describes how to create a read-write role with access to a specific database and schema. An SQL statement summary is provided at the end.

To create a read-write role:

1. Connect to your database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Create a `readwrite` role using the following statement. A password is required.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readwrite PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

3. Grant the `readwrite` role read-write privileges on the schema. Replace `<database>` and `<schema>` with actual database and schema names, respectively.

     ```sql
    -- Grant permission to connect to the database
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE and CREATE on the schema
    GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all existing tables in the schema
     GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite; 

    -- grant SELECT on all tables added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE on all sequences in the schema
    GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;

    -- Grant USAGE on all sequences added in the future
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO readwrite;
    ```

4. Create a database user. The password requirements mentioned above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE readwrite_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `readwrite` role to `readwrite_user1`:

    ```sql
    GRANT readwrite TO readwrite_user1;
    ```

    The `readwrite_user1` user now has read-write access to tables in the specified schema and database and should able to connect and run `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` queries.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://readwrite_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> INSERT INTO <table_name> (col1, col2) VALUES (1, 2);
    ```

### SQL statement summary

To create the read-write role and user described above, run the following statements from an SQL client:

```sql
-- readwrite role
CREATE ROLE readwrite PASSWORD '<password>';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database> TO readwrite;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO readwrite;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema> GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO readwrite;

-- User creation
CREATE USER readwrite_user1 WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT readwrite TO readwrite_user1;
```

## Create a developer role

This section describes how to create a "development branch" and grant developers full access to a database on the development branch. To accomplish this, we create a developer role on the "parent" branch, create a development branch, and then assign users to the developer role on the development branch.

As you work through the steps in this scenario, remember that when you create a branch in Neon, you are creating a clone of the parent branch, which includes the roles and databases on the parent branch.

To get started:

1. Connect to the database **on the parent branch** from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). If you need help connecting, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

2. Use your default Neon role or another role with `neon_superuser` privileges to create a developer role **on the parent branch**. For example, create a role named `dev_users`.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE dev_users PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

    The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

2. Grant the `dev_users` role privileges on the database:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO dev_users;
    ```

    You now have a `dev_users` role on your parent branch, and the role is not assigned to any users. This role will now be included in all future branches created from this branch.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The `GRANT` statement above does not grant privileges on existing schemas, tables, sequences, etc., within the database. If you want the `dev_users` role to access specific schemas, tables, etc., you need to grant those permissions explicitly.

    For example, to grant all privileges on all tables in a schema:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO dev_users;
    ```

    Similarly, you'd grant privileges for sequences and other objects as needed.

    That said, the `GRANT` command above allows users with the `dev_users` role to create new schemas within the database. But for pre-existing schemas and their objects, you need to grant permissions explicitly.
    </Admonition>

3. Create a development branch. Name it something like `dev1`. See [Create a branch](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch) for instructions.

4. Connect to the database **on the development branch** with an SQL client. Be mindful that a child branch connection string differs from a parent branch connection string. The branches reside on different hosts. If you need help connecting to your branch, see [Connect from any client](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

4. After connecting the database on your new branch, create a developer user (e.g., `dev_user1`). The password requirements described above apply here as well.

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE dev_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

5. Assign the `dev_users` role to the `dev_user1` user:

    ```sql
    GRANT dev_users TO dev_user1;
    ```

    The `dev_user1` user can now connect to the database on your development branch and start using the database with full privileges.

    ```bash
    psql postgres://dev_user1:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    psql (15.2 (Ubuntu 15.2-1.pgdg22.04+1), server 15.3)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> 
    ```

### SQL statement summary

```sql
-- dev_users role
CREATE ROLE dev_users PASSWORD `password`;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database> TO dev_users;

-- optionally, grant access to an existing schema
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO dev_users;

-- User creation
CREATE ROLE dev_user1 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT dev_users TO dev_user1;
```

## Revoke privileges

If you set up privilege-holding roles as describe above, you can revoke privileges by removing assigned roles. For example, to remove the `readwrite` role from `readwrite_user1`, run the following SQL statement:

```sql
REVOKE readwrite FROM readwrite_user1;
```

## Public schema privileges

When creating a new database, Postgres creates a schema named `public` in the database and permits access to the schema to a predefined Postgres role named `public`. Newly created roles in Postgres are automatically assigned the `public` role. In Postgres 14, the public role has `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on the `public` schema. In Postgres 15 and higher, the `public` role has only `USAGE` privileges on the `public` schema.

Why does this matter? If you create a new role and want to limit access for that role, you should be aware of the default `public` schema access automatically assigned to newly created roles.

If you want to limit access to the `public` schema for your users, you have to revoke privileges on the `public` schema explicitly.

For users of Postgres 14, the SQL statement to revoke the default `CREATE` permission on the `public` schema from the `public` role is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

You must be the owner of the `public` schema or a member of a role that authorizes you to execute this SQL statement.

To restrict the `public` roleâs capability to connect to a database, use this statement:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE <database> FROM PUBLIC;
```

This ensures users are unable to connect to a database by default unless this permission is explicitly granted.

## More information

For more information about granting privileges in Postgres, please see the [GRANT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html) command in the _PostgreSQL documentation_.

Neon does not yet provide support for configuring automated backups in the Neon Console or API. This feature is on our roadmap. You can expect it to be introduced in the coming months. In the meantime, we support the following backup options:

## Built-in backups with Neon's point-in-time restore feature

By default, Neon retains a 7-day history for all branches, allowing you to restore your data to a particular date and time or Log Sequence Number (LSN). The history retention period is configurable. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. With this backup option, no action or automation is required. You can restore your data to a past state at any time by creating a database branch, which is a near-instant operation. This feature is referred to [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore).

For information about creating a point-in-time restore branch, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

## pg_dump

You can backup a database using `pg_dump`, in the same way backups are created for a standalone Postgres instance.

This method dumps a single database in a single branch of your Neon project. If you need to create backups for multiple databases in multiple branches, you must perform a dump operation for each database in each branch separately.

To dump a database from your Neon project, please refer to the `pg_dump` instructions in our [Import from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres) guide.

Please be aware that dumping data from Neon is considered "data transfer". For data transfer costs, please refer to our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) documentation.

# Logical replication

Logical Replication is a method of replicating data between databases or between your database and other data services or platforms. It differs from physical replication in that it replicates transactional changes rather than copying the entire database byte-for-byte. This approach allows for selective replication, where users can choose specific tables or rows for replication. It works by capturing DML operations in the source database and applying these changes to the target, which could be another Postgres database or data platform. 

With logical replication, you can copy some or all of your data to a different location and continue sending updates from your source database in real-time, allowing you to maintain up-to-date copies of your data in different locations.

<Admonition type="note">
For step-by-step setup instructions, refer to our [logical replication guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).
</Admonition>

## Publisher subscriber model

The Postgres logical replication architecture is very simple. It uses a _publisher and subscriber_ model for data replication. The primary data source is the _publisher_, and the database or platform receiving the data is the _subscriber_. On the initial connection from a subscriber, all the data is copied from the publisher to the subscriber. After the initial copy operation, any changes made on the publisher are sent to the subscriber. You can read more about this model in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

![Logical replication publisher subscriber archtitecture](/docs/guides/logical_replication_model.jpg)

## Enabling logical replication

In Neon, you can enable logical replication from the Neon Console:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Replication**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

Enabling logical replication turns on detailed logging, which is required to support the replication process. This increases the amount of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). Typically, you can expect a 10% to 30% increase in the amount of data written to the WAL, depending on the extent of write activity.

## Publications

The Postgres documentation describes a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) as a group of tables whose data changes are intended to be replicated through logical replication. It also describes a publication as a set of changes generated from a table or a group of tables. It's indeed both of these things.

A particular table can be included in multiple publications if necessary. Currently, publications can only include tables within a single schema.

Publications can specify the types of changes they replicate, which can include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` operations. By default, publications replicate all of these operation types. 

You can create a publication for one or more on the "publisher" database using [CREATE PUBLICATION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html) syntax. For example, this command creates a publication named `users_publication` that tracks changes made to a `users` table.

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
```

## Subscriptions

A subscription represents the downstream side of logical replication. It establishes a connection to the publisher and identifies the publication it intends to subscribe to. 

A single subscriber can maintain multiple subscriptions, including multiple subscriptions to the same publisher. 

You can create a subscription on a "susbcriber" database or platform using [CREATE SUBSCRIPTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsubscription.html) syntax. Building on the `users_publication` example above, hereâs how you would create a subscription:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION users_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION users_publication;
```

A subscription requires a unique name, a database connection string, the name and password of your replication role, and the name of the publication it subscribes to.

## How does it work under the hood?

While the publisher and subscriber model forms the surface of PostgreSQL logical replication, the underlying mechanism is driven by a few key components, described below.

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

The WAL is central to Postgres's data durability and crash recovery mechanisms. In the context of logical replication, the WAL records all changes to your data. For logical replication, the WAL serves as the primary source of data that needs to be replicated. It's the transaction data captured in the WAL that's processed and then relayed from a publisher to a subscriber.

### Replication slots

Replication slots on the publisher database track replication progress, ensuring that no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it. This mechanism helps maintain data consistency and prevent data loss in cases of network interruption or subscriber downtime.

Replication slots are typically created automatically with new subscriptions, but they can be created manually using the `pg_create_logical_replication_slot` function. Some "subscriber" data services and platforms require that you create a dedicated replication slot. This is accomplished using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The first value, `my_replication_slot` is the name given to the replication slot. The second value is the decoder plugin the slot should use. Decoder plugins are discussed below.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter defines the maximum number of replication slots that can be used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default.

```ini
max_replication_slots = 10
```

### Decoder plugins

The Postgres replication architecture uses decoder plugins to decode WAL entries into a logical replication stream, making the data understandable for the subscriber. The default decoder plugin for PostgreSQL logical replication is `pgoutput`, and it's included in Postgres by default. You don't need to worry about installing it.

Neon, supports an alternative decoder plugin called `wal2json`. This decoder plugin differs from `pgoutput` in that it converts WAL data into `JSON` format, which is useful for integrating Postgres with systems and applications that work with `JSON` data.

To use this decoder plugin, you'll need to create a dedicated replication slot for it, as shown here:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'wal2json');
```

For for more information about this alternative decoder plugin and how top use it, see [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json).

### WAL senders

WAL senders are processes on the publisher database that read the WAL and send the relevant data to the subscriber. 

The `max_wal_senders` parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender processes that are responsible for streaming WAL data to subscribers. In most cases, you should have one WAL sender process for each subscriber or replication slot to ensure efficient and consistent data replication.

The `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default, which matches the maximum number of replication slots defined by the `max_replication_slots` setting.

```ini
max_wal_senders = 10
```

### WAL receivers

On the subscriber side, WAL receivers receive the replication stream (the decoded WAL data), and apply these changes to the subscriber. The number of WAL receivers is determined by the number of connections made by subscribers.

This topic provides commands for managing publications, subscriptions, and replication slots. It also includes information about logical replication specific to Neon, including [known limitations](#known-limitations).

For step-by-step setup instructions, refer to our [logical replication guides](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide).

<Admonition type="note">
Logical replication in Neon is currently in Beta. We welcome your feedback to help improve this feature. You can provide feedback via the **Feedback** link in the Neon Console or by reaching out to us on [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ).
</Admonition>

## Publications

This section outlines how to manage **publications** in your replication setup.

### Create a publication

This command creates a publication named `my_publication` that will track changes made to the `users` table:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users;
```

This command creates a publication that publishes all changes in two tables:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users, departments;
```
<Admonition type="note">
Neon currently does not support creating publications using `CREATE PUBLICATION publication_name FOR ALL TABLES` syntax.Â The `ALL TABLES` clause requires the PostgreSQL superuser privilege, which is not available in a managed service like Neon.
</Admonition>

This command creates a publication that only publishes `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations. Delete operations will not be published.

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users
    WITH (publish = 'insert,update');
```

### Add a table to a publication

This command adds a table to a publication:

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ADD TABLE sales;
```

### Remove a table from a publication

This command removes a table from a publication:

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication DROP TABLE sales;
```

### Remove a publication

This command removes a publication:

```sql
DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS my_publication;
```

### Recreate a publication

This command recreates a publication within a single transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
  -- drop the publication
  DROP PUBLICATION IF EXISTS my_publication;

  -- re-create the publication
  CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication;
COMMIT;
```

## Subscriptions

This section outlines how to manage **subscriptions** in your replication setup.

<Admonition type="note">
Currently, you cannot create subscriptions on a Neon database. Neon can only act as a publisher in a replication setup. The commands in this section would only be run on an external Postgres database that you are using as a subscriber.
</Admonition>

### Create a subscription

Building on the `my_publication` example in the preceding section, hereâs how you can create a subscription:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication;
```

A subscription requires a unique name, a database connection string, the name and password of your replication role, and the name of the publication that it subscribes to.

In the example above, `my_subscription` is the name of the subscription that connects to a publication named `my_publication`. In the example above, you would replace the connection details with your Neon database connection string, which you'll find in the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**.

### Create a subscription with two publications

This command creates a subscription that receives data from two publications:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication, sales_publication;
```

A single subscriber can maintain multiple subscriptions, including multiple subscriptions to the same publisher. 

### Create a subscription to be enabled later

This command creates a subscription with `enabled = false` so that you can enable the scription at a later time:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription 
CONNECTION 'postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname' 
PUBLICATION my_publication
WITH (enabled = false);
```

### Change the publication subscribed to

This command modifies an existing subscription to set it to a different publication:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription SET PUBLICATION new_new_publication;
```

### Change the subscription connection

This command updates the connection details for a subscription:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION subscription_name CONNECTION 'new_connection_string';
```

### Disable a subscription

This command disables an existing subscription:

```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription DISABLE;
```

### Drop a subscription

This command drops an existing subscription:

```sql
DROP SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription;
```

## Replication slots

Replication slots are created on the publisher database to track replication progress, ensuring that no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it. This mechanism serves to maintain data consistency and prevent data loss in cases of network interruption or subscriber downtime.

### Create a replication slot

Replication slots are typically created automatically with new subscriptions, but they can be created manually using the `pg_create_logical_replication_slot` function. Some "subscriber" data services and platforms require that you create a dedicated replication slot. This is accomplished using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The first value, `my_replication_slot` is the name given to the replication slot. The second value is the [decoder plugin](#decoder-plugins) the slot should use.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter defines the maximum number of replication slots that can be used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

The `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter on Neon is set to `10` by default.

```ini
max_replication_slots = 10
```

### Remove a replication slot

To drop a logical replication slot that you created, you can use the `pg_drop_replication_slot()` function. For example, if you've already created a replication slot named `my_replication_slot` using `pg_create_logical_replication_slot()`, you can drop it by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('my_replication_slot');
```

This command removes the specified replication slot (`my_replication_slot` in this case) from your database. It's important to ensure that the replication slot is no longer in use or required before dropping it, as this action is irreversible and could affect replication processes relying on this slot.

## Data Definition Language (DDL) operations

Logical replication in Postgres primarily handles Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. However, it does not automatically replicate Data Definition Language (DDL) operations such as `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `DROP TABLE`. This means that schema changes in the publisher database are not directly replicated to the subscriber database.

Manual intervention is required to replicate DDL changes. This can be done by applying the DDL changes separately in both the publisher and subscriber databases or by using third-party tools that can handle DDL replication.

## Monitoring replication

To ensure that your logical replication setup is running as expected, you should monitor replication processes regularly. The [pg_stat_replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW) view displays information about each active replication connection to the publisher.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
```
It provides details like the state of the replication, the last received WAL location, sent location, write location, and the delay between the publisher and subscriber.

Additionally, the [pg_replication_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-replication-slots.html) view shows information about the current replication slots on the publisher, including their size.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

It's important to keep an eye on replication lag, which indicates how far behind the subscriber is from the publisher. A significant replication lag could mean that the subscriber isn't receiving updates in a timely manner, which could lead to data inconsistencies.

## Neon specifics

This section outlines information about logical replication specific to Neon, including known limitations.

### Enabling logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Once you enable logical replication in Neon, the setting cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

In Neon, logical replication is enabled from the console, by following these steps:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Replication**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level 
-----------
logical
```

### Logical replication and Auto-suspend

By default, a Neon compute instance scales to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, this setting is fixed. [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can increase, decrease, or disable the _Auto-suspend_ setting, controlling when or if a compute scales to zero.

In a logical replication setup, a subscriber may keep the connection to your Neon publisher database active in order to poll for changes or perform sync operations, preventing your Neon compute instance from scaling to zero. Some subscribers allow you to configure connection or sync frequency, which may be necessary to continue taking advantage of Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature. Please refer to your subscriber's documentation or contact their support team for details.

### Replication roles

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege. Roles created via SQL do not have this privilege, and the `REPLICATION` privilege cannot be granted.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a replication role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can verify that your role has the `REPLICATION` privilege by running the follow query:

```sql
SELECT rolname, rolreplication 
FROM pg_roles 
WHERE rolname = '<role_name>';
```

### Subscriber access

A subscriber must be able to access the Neon database that is acting as a publisher. In Neon, no action is required unless you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon.

If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature:

1. Determine the IP address or addresses of the subscriber.
2. In your Neon project, add the IPs to your **IP Allow** list, which you can find in your project's settings. For instructions, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

### Decoder plugins

Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` replication output decoder plugins.

- `pgoutput`: This is the default logical replication output plugin for Postgres. Specifically, it's part of the Postgres built-in logical replication system, designed to read changes from the database's write-ahead log (WAL) and output them in a format suitable for logical replication. 
- `wal2json`: This is also a logical replication output plugin for Postgres, but it differs from `pgoutput` in that it converts WAL data into `JSON` format. This makes it useful for integrating Postgres with systems and applications that work with `JSON` data. For usage information, see [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json).

### Dedicated replication slots

Some data services and platforms require dedicated replication slots. You can create a dedicated replication slot using the standard PostgreSQL syntax. As mentioned above, Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` replication output decoder plugins.

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_replication_slot', 'wal2json');
```

### Publisher settings

The `max_wal_senders` and `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter settings on Neon are set to `10`.

```text
max_wal_senders = 10
max_replication_slots = 10
```

- The `max_wal_senders` parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender processes that are responsible for streaming WAL data to subscribers. In most cases, you should have one WAL sender process for each subscriber or replication slot to ensure efficient and consistent data replication. 
- The `max_replication_slots` defines the maximum number of replication slots which are used to manage database replication connections. Each replication slot tracks changes in the publisher database to ensure that the connected subscriber stays up to date. You'll want a replication slot for each replication connection. For example, if you expect to have 10 separate subscribers replicating from your database, you would set `max_replication_slots` to 10 to accommodate each connection.

If you require different values for these parameters, please contact Neon support.

### Known limitations

Neon is working toward removing the following limitations in future releases:

- A Neon database can only act as a _publisher_ in a replication setup. Creating a subscription on a Neon database is not permitted. This means that you cannot replicate data from one Neon database to another or from one Neon project to another.
- Only your default Neon Postgres role and roles created via the Neon Console, CLI, or API have the `REPLICATION` privilege. This privilege cannot be granted to other roles. You can expect this limitation to be lifted in a future release. Roles created via SQL do not have the `REPLICATION` privilege, and this privilege cannot be granted.
- You cannot use `CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR ALL TABLES` syntax in Neon. Specifying `ALL TABLES` requires the Postgres `superuser` privilege, which is not available on Neon. Instead, you can specify multiple tables using `CREATE PUBLICATION my_pub FOR TABLE <table1>, <table2>` syntax.

title: Enable Autoscaling in Neon
subtitle: Learn how to enable Neon's Autoscaling feature to automatically scale compute
  resources on demand
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-24T18:56:54.982Z'
---

Neon's Autoscaling feature dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute endpoint in response to the current workload, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This guide demonstrates how to enable _Autoscaling_ in your Neon project.

_Autoscaling_ is a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature. Neon Pro Plan users can enable Autoscaling for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute endpoint. _Autoscaling_ is supported with both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints enable Neon's [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) feature.

## Enable Autoscaling for a new project

Enabling Autoscaling when you create a project allows you to set _Autoscaling_ default settings for all compute endpoints created in your project. You can adjust _Autoscaling_ settings for individual compute endpoints afterward, but setting defaults when creating a project saves you from having to configure the settings for each compute endpoint later on.

To enable Autoscaling when you first create your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region.
4. Under **Compute size**, select the **Autoscaling** option.
5. Using the slider, specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling_project_creation.png)

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the Auto-suspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>

6. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute endpoint is created with the specified settings. All future compute endpoints that you create will use this setting.

## Enable Autoscaling for an existing project

Configuring the _Autoscaling_ setting for an existing project sets the project's default, which is applied to all compute endpoints created from that point forward. Existing compute endpoints are unaffected. You can adjust _Autoscaling_ default or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure Autoscaling default settings for an existing project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
1. Select **Compute** and click **Change**.
1. Under **Compute size**, select the **Autoscaling** option.
1. Using the slider, specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling_existing_project.png)

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the Auto-suspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>

6. Click **Save**.

## Enable Autoscaling for a compute endpoint

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can edit an individual compute endpoint to alter the compute endpoint configuration, which includes _Autoscaling_.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click on the compute endpoint you want to edit.
![Edit compute endpoint menu](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit.png)
1. Under **Compute size**, select the **Autoscaling** option.
1. Using the slider, specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
    ![Autoscaling edit settings](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit_settings.png)

    Neon scales the compute size up and down within the specified range to meet workload demand. _Autoscaling_ currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 7 vCPUs. One vCPU has 4 GB of RAM, 2 vCPUs have 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPUs.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure the Auto-suspend setting for your compute endpoint at the same time. The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. This feature is also referred to as "scale-to-zero".
    </Admonition>
1. Click **Save**.

## Monitor Autoscaling

The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function for monitoring how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).

Neon's [Auto-suspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) feature controls when a Neon compute instance transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity. This guide demonstrates how to configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting in your Neon project.

[Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute endpoint. Configuring the _Auto-suspend_ setting for a new or existing project sets the project's default Auto-suspend setting, which is used from that point forward when creating new compute endpoints.

### Configure the Auto-suspend setting for a new project

Configuring the _Auto-suspend_ setting for a new project sets the project's default, which is applied to all compute endpoints created from that point forward. You can adjust this _Auto-suspend_ default at any time, or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure the _Auto-suspend_ default setting when you first create your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
1. Specify a name, a Postgres version, and a region.
1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period (5 minutes or a custom period). The maximum setting is 7 days. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** means the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Create Project**. Your initial compute endpoint is created with the specified setting.

### Configure the Auto-suspend setting for an existing project

Configuring the _Auto-suspend_ setting for an existing project sets the project's default, which is applied to all compute endpoints created from that point forward. Existing compute endpoints are unaffected. You can adjust the _Auto-suspend_ default or configure the setting for individual compute endpoints later, as necessary.

To configure the Auto-suspend default for an existing project:

1. Select a project in the Neon console.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
1. Select **Compute** and click **Change**.
1. Select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period (5 minutes or a custom period). The maximum setting is 7 days. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** means the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure default **Compute size** settings at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.

## Configure Auto-suspend for a compute endpoint

To configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting for an individual compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
![Edit compute endpoint menu](/docs/guides/autoscaling_edit.png)
1. Under **Compute size**, select **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** and specify your delay period (5 minutes or a custom period). The maximum setting is 7 days. Deselecting **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** means the compute is always active.

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can configure **Compute size** settings for your compute endpoint at the same time.
    </Admonition>

1. Click **Save**.

## Monitor auto-suspension

You can monitor auto-suspension on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute reports either an **Active** or **Idle** status.

![Compute endpoint status](/docs/connect/compute_endpoint_state.png)

You can also view compute state transitions in the **Branches** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

User actions that activate an idle compute include [connecting from a client such as psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), running a query on your database from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), or accessing the compute via the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="info">
The Neon API includes [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) and [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
</Admonition>

You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it transitions from an **Idle** to an **Active** state.

Neon retains a history of changes for all branches in a Neon project, which allows you to create a branch that restores data to any time within the defined history retention period. You can use this capability to recover lost data, which is a form of Point-in-time restore (PITR).

The history retention period is configurable. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. For configuration instructions, see [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).

This guide shows how to recover your data to a point in time before a data loss occurred using Neon's branching feature.

## Create a point-in-time branch

Suppose that you have a table named `orders` that was accidentally deleted by a faulty query. If you know the time you ran the faulty query or when the data loss was first discovered, you can create a point-in-time branch with the data as it existed before the data loss occurred.

To create a point-in-time branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
![Create branch dialog](/docs/guides/create_data_recovery_branch.png)
4. Enter a name for the branch.
5. Select a parent branch.
6. Under **Include data up to**, select the **Specific date and time** option, which creates a branch with data up to the specified date and time. For example, if the data loss occurred on Nov 26, 2023 at 5:01pm, select Nov 11, 2023, at 5:00pm, just before the faulty query was run.

    <Admonition type="note">
    The **Specific date and time** option does not include data changes that occured after the specified date and time, which means the branch contains data as it existed previously. You can only specify a date and time that falls within your history retention window, which is 7 days by default. See [Configure history retention](/docs/manage/projects#configure-history-retention).
    </Admonition>

8. Click **Create new branch** to create your branch.

You are directed to the **Branches** page where you are shown the details for your new branch.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can also create point-in-time branches using the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli). For example, you can perform the same action described above with the following CLI command:

```bash
neonctl branches create --name recovery_branch --parent 2023-07-11T10:00:00Z
```

The timestamp must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/).

</Admonition>

## Connect to your branch

Connecting to your newly created branch requires connecting via the branch's compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect using `psql` and a connection string obtained from the Neon Console.

<Admonition type="note">
You can also query the databases in a branch from the Neon SQL Editor. For instructions, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).
</Admonition>

To connect to your branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. On the project **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select your `recovery_branch`, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
![Connection details widget recovery branch](/docs/guides/data_recovery_connection_details.png)
3. Copy the connection string. A connection string includes your role name, password, compute endpoint hostname, and database name.
4. Connect with `psql`.

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

## Verify the data

Check to see if the lost data is now present. For instance, if you lost an `orders` table, you might run a query like this one to verify that the data is available in your newly created branch:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;
```

## Change your primary branch

You now have a production branch with lost data and a recovery branch with the data in the desired state. You could dump data from the recovery branch and load it into the production branch using dump and restore utilities like `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`, or you can make the recovery branch your new primary branch and use it for production.

To make the recovery branch your new primary:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches** to view the branches for the project.
3. Select your `recovery_branch` from the table.
4. On the branch details page, select **Set as Primary**.

Making a branch your primary branch ensures that access to data on the branch is never interrupted, even when you exceed project limits. For more information, see [Primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch).

<Admonition type="note">
If your previous primary branch was your project's root branch (the initial branch created with your project), it cannot be deleted. Deleting a root branch is not yet supported. In the meantime, you can rename a root branch (perhaps adding an `OLD` or `DO_NOT_USE` prefix to its name) and remove data from it to ensure that it's not used accidentally or consuming storage space.
</Admonition>

## Update your connections

To use your new primary branch with your applications, update your application connection details. To do so, replace your current connection details with the connection details for your new primary branch, which you retrieved earlier when connecting to your branch.

Alternatively, if you do not want change connection details, you can move the compute endpoint from your old primary branch to the new  branch. See [Reassign the compute endpoint](#reassign-the-compute-endpoint) for instructions.

## Reassign the compute endpoint

To avoid changing connection details in your application, you can reassign the compute endpoint from your old primary branch to your new  branch. If you followed the steps above, you created a branch with a compute endpoint. In this case, you have to:

1. **Remove the compute endpoint from the new branch**

   For instructions, see [Delete a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#delete-a-compute-endpoint).

2. **Move the compute endpoint from the old primary branch to the new branch**

   This action is currently only supported in the Neon API. See [Update a compute endpoint with the CLI](/docs/manage/endpoints#update-a-compute-endpoint-with-the-api) for instructions.

## Examples

- [Using Neon branching for instant point-in-time restore](https://neon.tech/blog/point-in-time-recovery). The blog post describes point-in-time restore and provides a script for creating a recovery branch, reassigning a compute endpoint, and setting the new branch as the primary.
- [Time Travel with Serverless Postgres](https://neon.tech/blog/time-travel-with-postgres). This blog post (with video) describes a data recovery example that uses Neon's branching feature, the Neon API, and a bisect script to recover lost data.

Complex queries that modify data or alter schemas have the potential to be destructive. It is advisable to test these types of queries before running them in production. On other database systems, testing potentially destructive queries can be time and resource intensive. For example, testing may involve setting up a separate database instance and replicating data. With Neon, you can instantly create a database branch with a full copy-on-write clone of your production data in just a few clicks. When you finish testing, you can remove the branch just as easily.

This guide walks you through creating a branch of your production data, testing a potentially destructive query, and deleting the branch when you are finished.

1. [Create a test branch](#create-a-test-branch)
3. [Test your query](#test-your-query)
4. [Delete the test branch](#delete-the-test-branch)

For the purpose of this guide, let's assume you have a database in Neon with the following table and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Post (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    author_name VARCHAR(100),
    date_published DATE
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Post (id, title, content, author_name, date_published)
VALUES
(1, 'My first post', 'This is the content of the first post.', 'Alice', '2023-01-01'),
(2, 'My second post', 'This is the content of the second post.', 'Alice', '2023-02-01'),
(3, 'Old post by Bob', 'This is an old post by Bob.', 'Bob', '2020-01-01'),
(4, 'Recent post by Bob', 'This is a recent post by Bob.', 'Bob', '2023-06-01'),
(5, 'Another old post', 'This is another old post.', 'Alice', '2019-06-01');
```

## Create a test branch

1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
![Create branch dialog](/docs/manage/create_branch.png)
4. Enter a name for the branch. This guide uses the name `my_test_branch`.
5. Select a parent branch. Select the branch defined as your primary branch.
6. Under **Include data up to**, select the **Current point in time** option to create a branch with the latest available data from the parent branch (the default).
7. Click **Create new branch** to create your branch.

You are directed to the **Branches** page where you are shown the details for your new branch.

You can also create a test branch using the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create) or [Neon API](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch-with-the-api).

<CodeTabs labels={["CLI", "API"]}>

```bash
neonctl branches create --project-id <project-id> --name my_test_branch
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project-id>/branches \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "name": "my_test_branch"
  }
}
' | jq
```

</CodeTabs>

## Test your query

Navigate to the **SQL Editor**, select the test branch, and run your query. For example, perhaps you are deleting blog posts from your database for a certain author published before a certain date, and you want to make sure the query only removes the intended records.

```sql
DELETE FROM Post
WHERE author_name = 'Alice' AND date_published < '2020-01-01';
```

Next, inspect the data to ensure the intended records were deleted, while others remained unaffected. This query allows you to quickly see if the number of records matches your expectations:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Post;
```

Before the `DELETE` query, there were 5 records. If the query ran correctly, this should now show 4.

## Delete the test branch

When you finish testing your query, you can delete the test branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select a project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Select the test branch from the table.
4. On the branch page, click the **More** drop-down menu and select **Delete**.
4. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

You can also delete a branch using the [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#delete) or [Neon API](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch-with-the-api).

<CodeTabs labels={["CLI", "API"]}>

```bash
neonctl branches delete my_test_branch
```

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project-id>/branches/<branch-id> \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' |jq
```

The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon CLI. For other branch-related CLI commands, refer to [Neon CLI commands â branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches). This guide also describes how to use the `--api-key` option to authenticate CLI branching commands from the command line.

The examples show the default `table` output format. The Neon CLI also supports `json` and `yaml` output formats. For example, if you prefer output in `json`, add `--output json` to your Neon CLI command.

## Prerequisites

- The Neon CLI. See [Install the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install) for instructions.
- To run CLI commands, you must either authenticate through your browser or supply an API key using the `--api-key` option. See [Connect with the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## Create a branch with the CLI

The following Neon CLI command creates a branch. If your Neon account has more than one project, you will be required to specify a project ID using the `--project-id` option. To view the CLI documentation for this command, refer to the [Neon CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).
The command response includes the branch ID, the compute endpoint ID, and and the connection URI for connecting to the branch.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can use the `--name` option with a `neonctl branches create` command to specify your own branch name instead of using the name generated by Neon. For example: `neonctl branches create --name mybranch`. Also, for any Neon CLI command, you can specify `--output json` to change the command output from the default table format to JSON format.

## Branching automation with the Neon CLI

The Neon CLI enables easy automation of branching operations for integration into your workflows or toolchains. To facilitate authentication to Neon when running a CLI command, the Neon CLI allows you to use an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

To use an API key, you can store it in an environment variable on your system. This prevents the key from being hardcoded into your automation scripts or exposed in another way. For example, you can add the following line to your shell's profile file (`.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for bash shell):

```bash
export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
```

After exporting your key, source the profile file (source `~/.bashrc` or source `~/.bash_profile`), or start a new terminal session.

You do not need to specify the variable name explicitly when using a Neon CLI command. A Neon CLI command looks for a `NEON_API_KEY` variable setting by default.

This API key configuration ensures that the API key is kept secure while still providing a way to authenticate your CLI commands. Remember, you should handle your API key with the same level of security as your other credentials.

The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may only show some of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` program specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](../manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a branch with the API

The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch).

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:

<Admonition type="note">
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's primary branch, and a compute endpoint is not created.
</Admonition>

```curl
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "type": "read_write"
    }
  ],
  "branch": {
    "parent_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433"
  }
}' | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API. It is a generated value that looks something like this: `autumn-disk-484331`.
- The `endpoints` attribute creates a compute endpoint, which is required to connect to the branch. Neon supports `read_write` and `read_only` endpoint types. A branch can be created with or without a compute endpoint. You can specify `read_only` to create a [read replica](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide).
- The `branch` attribute specifies the parent branch.
- The `parent_id` can be obtained by listing the branches for your project. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api). The `parent_id` is the `id` of the branch you are branching from. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. You can branch from your Neon project's primary branch or a non-primary branch.

The response includes information about the branch, the branch's compute endpoint, and the `create_branch` and `start_compute` operations that were initiated.

```text
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/branches/br-dawn-scene-747675' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' | jq
```

- The `project_id` for a Neon project is found on the **Settings** page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API.
- The `branch_id` can be found by listing the branches for your project. The `<branch_id>` is the `id` of a branch. A branch `id` has a `br-` prefix. See [List branches](#list-branches-with-the-api).

The response shows information about the branch being deleted and the `suspend_compute` and `delete_timeline` operations that were initiated.

# Refresh a branch with the Neon API

title: Refresh a branch
subtitle: Learn how to refresh a Neon branch using the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T10:43:33.373Z'
---

When you create a branch in Neon, you create a copy-on-write clone that reflects the current state of the parent branch, but what do you do if your branch becomes stale? For example, changes are made to the data or schema on the parent branch that you would like reflected in your development branch, or your branch has aged out of the point-in-time restore window (the history shared with the parent branch) and is now taking up storage space. Ideally, you want to refresh your branch but keep the same compute endpoint, whose connection details may already be configured in your application or toolchain.

There isn't a single command that refreshes a branch, but you can do so using a combination of Neon API calls. The procedure described below refreshes a branch by performing the following steps:

1. [Creating a new up-to-date branch without a compute endpoint](#create-a-new-up-to-date-branch-without-a-compute-endpoint)
2. [Moving the compute endpoint from your current branch to the new branch](#move-the-compute-endpoint-from-your-current-branch-to-the-new-branch)
3. [Deleting the old branch](#delete-the-old-branch)
4. [Renaming the new branch to the name of the old branch](#rename-the-new-branch-to-the-name-of-the-old-branch)

<Admonition type="important">
The branch refresh procedure does not preserve data or schema changes on your current branch. Do not perform this procedure if you need to maintain changes made to your branch. The procedure is best suited to branches used in a read-only capacity.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

The following information is required to perform the procedure:

- A Neon API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- The `project_id` for your Neon project. You can obtain a `project_id` using the [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) method, or you can find it on your project's **Settings** page in the Neon Console.
- The `branch_id` of the current branch. You can obtain a `branch_id` using the [List branches](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches) method, or you can find it on your project's **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A `branch_id` has a `br-` prefix.
- The `endpoint_id` of the compute endpoint associated with the current branch. You can obtain an `endpoint_id` using the [List endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method, or you can find it on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. An `endpoint_id` has an `ep-` prefix.

## Create a new up-to-date branch without a compute endpoint

The [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) request shown below creates a branch without a compute endpoint. The only required parameter is your Neon `project_id`. The `project_id` value used in the example below is `dark-cell-12604300`. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key.

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/dark-cell-12604300/branches \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "name": "dev_branch_2"
  }
}
'
```

The response body includes the `id` of your new branch. You will need this value (`br-falling-flower-15986510`) to move the compute endpoint in the next step.

# Promote a branch with the Neon API

title: Promote a branch
subtitle: Learn how to promote a branch to the primary branch of your Neon project using
  the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-24T18:56:54.983Z'
---

This guide describes how to create a new branch and promote it to the primary branch of your Neon project in the context of a data recovery scenario. It also describes how to move the compute endpoint from your existing primary branch to the new branch to avoid having to reconfigure your application's database connection details.

## What is a primary branch?

Each Neon project has a primary branch. In the Neon Console, your primary branch is identified on the **Branches** page by a `PRIMARY` tag. You can designate any branch as the primary branch. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch, which is typically the branch used in production.

- For [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch remains accessible if you exceed the _Active time_ limit of 100 hours per month.
- For [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users, the compute endpoint associated with the primary branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. Neon has a default limit of 20 simultaneously active computes to protect your account from unintended usage.

## Why promote a branch to primary?

A common usage scenario involving promoting a branch to primary is data recovery. For example, a data loss occurs on the current primary branch. To recover the lost data, you create a point-in-time branch with data that existed before the data loss occurred. To avoid modifying your application's database connection configuration, you move the compute endpoint from the current primary branch to the new branch and make that branch your primary.

The procedure described below creates a new branch and promotes it to the primary branch of your project by performing the following steps:

1. [Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint](#creating-a-new-point-in-time-branch-without-a-compute-endpoint)
2. [Moving the compute endpoint from your current primary branch to the new branch](#move-the-compute-endpoint-from-your-current-primary-branch-to-the-new-branch)
3. [Renaming the old primary branch](#rename-the-old-primary-branch)
4. [Renaming the new branch to the name of the old primary branch](#rename-the-new-branch-to-the-name-of-the-old-primary-branch)
5. [Promoting the new branch to primary](#promote-the-new-branch-to-primary)

## Prerequisites

The following information is required to perform the procedure:

- A Neon API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- The `project_id` for your Neon project. You can obtain a `project_id` using the [List projects](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojects) method, or you can find it on your project's **Settings** page in the Neon Console.
- The `branch_id` of the current primary branch. You can obtain a `branch_id` using the [List branches](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectbranches) method, or you can find it on the your project's **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A `branch_id` has a `br-` prefix.
- The `endpoint_id` of the compute endpoint associated with the current primary branch. You can obtain an `endpoint_id` using the [List endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method, or you can find it on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. An `endpoint_id` has an `ep-` prefix.

## Creating a new point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint

The [Create branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranch) request shown below creates a point-in-time branch without a compute endpoint. The `project_id` is a required parameter. To create a point-in-time branch, specify a `parent_timestamp` value in the `branch` object. The `parent_timestamp` value must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). For more information about point-in-time restore, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore (PITR)](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

The `project_id` value used in the example below is `young-silence-08999984`. You must also set the `$NEON_API_KEY` variable or replace `$NEON_API_KEY` with an actual API key. The branch is given the  name `recovery_branch`. You will change the name in a later step.

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/young-silence-08999984/branches \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "branch": {
    "parent_timestamp": "2023-09-02T10:00:00Z",
    "name": "recovery_branch"
  }
}
'
```

The response body includes the `id` of your new branch. You will need this value (`br-solitary-hat-85369851`) to move the compute endpoint in the next step.

<Admonition type="note">
Logical replication in Neon is currently in Beta. We welcome your feedback to help improve this feature. You can provide feedback via the **Feedback** link in the Neon Console or by reaching out to us on [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ).
</Admonition>

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon database to external destinations, allowing for Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. Stream your data to data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, external Postgres databases, and more.

![Neon logical replication subscribers image](/docs/guides/logical_replication_subscribers.png)

Logical replication in Neon works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.

Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.

To get started, jump into one of our step-by-step [logical replication guides](#logical-replication-guides).

To learn more about Postgres logical replication, see [Learn about logical replication](#learn-about-logical-replication).

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations. 

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is an open-source data integration platform that moves data from a source to a destination system. Airbyte offers a large library of connectors for various data sources and destinations.

In this guide, you will learn how to define your Neon Postgres database as a data source in Airbyte so that you can stream data to one or more of Airbyte's supported destinations.

## Prerequisites

- An [Airbyte account](https://airbyte.com/)
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)

## Enable logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor):

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication in the future.

## Create a replication slot

Airbyte requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.

Airbyte uses the `pgoutput` plugin in Postgres for decoding WAL changes into a logical replication stream. To create a replication slot called `airbyte_slot` that uses the `pgoutput` plugin, run the following command on your database using your replication role:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('airbyte_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

`airbyte_slot` is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide this name when you set up your Airbyte source.

## Create a publication

Perform the following steps for each table you want to replicate data from:

1. Add the replication identity (the method of distinguishing between rows) for each table you want to replicate:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT;
    ```

    In rare cases, if your tables use data types that support [TOAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) or have very large field values, consider using `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` instead: 

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

2. Create the Postgres publication. Include all tables you want to replicate as part of the publication:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION airbyte_publication FOR TABLE <tbl1, tbl2, tbl3>;
    ```

    The publication name is customizable. Refer to the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.


<Admonition type="note">
The Airbyte UI currently allows selecting any tables for Change Data Capture (CDC). If a table is selected that is not part of the publication, it will not be replicated even though it is selected. If a table is part of the publication but does not have a replication identity, the replication identity will be created automatically on the first run if the Postgres role you use with Airbyte has the necessary permissions.
</Admonition>

## Create a Postgres source in Airbyte

1. From your Airbyte Cloud account, select **Sources** from the left navigation bar, search for **Postgres**, and then create a new Postgres source.
2. Enter the connection details for your Neon database. You can get these details from your Neon connection string, which you'll find in the **Connection Details** widget on the **Dashboard** of your Neon project. 
    For example, given a connection string like this:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    Enter the details in the Airbyte **Create a source** dialog as shown below. Your values will differ.

    - **Host**: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
    - **Port**: 5432
    - **Database Name**: dbname
    - **Username**: alex
    - **Password**: AbC123dEf

    ![Airbyte Create a source](/docs/guides/airbyte_create_source.png)

3. Under **Optional fields**, list the schemas you want to sync. Schema names are case-sensitive, and multiple schemas may be specified. By default, `public` is the only selected schema.
4. Select an SSL mode. You will most frequently choose `require` or `verify-ca`. Both of these options always require encryption. The `verify-ca` mode requires a certificate. Refer to [Connect securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely) for information about the location of certificate files you can use with Neon.
5. Under **Advanced**:
    
    - Select **Logical Replication (CDC)** from available replication methods.
    - In the **Replication Slot** field, enter the name of the replication slot you created previously: `airbyte_slot`.
    - In the **Publication** field, enter the name of the publication you created previously: `airbyte_publication`.
    ![Airbyte advanced fields](/docs/guides/airbyte_cdc_advanced_fields.png)

## Allow inbound traffic

If you are on Airbyte Cloud, and you are using Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP address that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Airbyte's IP addresses. You can find a list of IPs that need to be allowlisted in the [Airbyte Security docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/operating-airbyte/security). For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Complete the source setup

To complete your source setup, click **Set up source** in the Airbyte UI. Airbyte will test the connection to your database. Once this succeeds, you've successfully configured an Airbyte Postgres source for your Neon database.

## Configure a destination

To complete your data integration setup, you can now add one of Airbyte's many supported destinations, such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Kafka, to name a few. After configuring a destination, you'll need to set up a connection between your Neon source database and your chosen destination. Refer to the Airbyte documentation for instructions:

- [Add a destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/getting-started/add-a-destination)
- [Set up a connection](https://docs.airbyte.com/using-airbyte/getting-started/set-up-a-connection)

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.

Confluent Cloud is a fully managed, cloud-native real-time data streaming service, built on Apache Kafka. It allows you to stream data from various sources, including Postgres, and build apps that consume messages from an Apache Kafka cluster.

In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from a Neon Postgres database to a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud. You will use the [PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-debezium.html) to read Change Data Capture (CDC) events from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) of your Neon database in real-time. The connector will write events to a Kafka stream and auto-generate a Kafka topic. The connector performs an initial snapshot of the table and then streams any future change events.

<Admonition type="note">
Confluent Cloud Connectors can be set up using the [Confluent Cloud UI](https://confluent.cloud/home) or the [Confluent command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html). This guide uses the Confluent Cloud UI.

## Prerequisites

- A [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud) account
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)

## Enable logical replication in Neon

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, which means that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor):

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a publication

In this example, we'll create a publication for a `users` table in the `public` schema of your Neon database.

1. Create the `users` table in your Neon database. You can do this via the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or by connecting to your Neon database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

2. Create a publication for the `users` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
    ```

This command creates a publication, named `users_publication`, which will include all changes to the `users` table in your replication stream.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication in the future.

## Create a replication slot

The Debezium connector requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.

To create a replication slot called `debezium`, run the following command on your database using your replication role:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('debezium', 'pgoutput');
```

- `debezium` is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide the slot name when you set up your source connector in Confluent. 
- `pgoutput` is the logical decoder plugin used in this example. Neon supports both `pgoutput` and `wal2json` decoder plugins. 

## Set up a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud

1. Sign in to Confluent Cloud at https://confluent.cloud.
2. Click **Add cluster**.
3. On the **Create cluster** page, for the **Basic cluster**, select **Begin configuration**.
4. On the **Region/zones** page, choose a cloud provider, a region, and select a single availability zone.
5. Select **Continue**.
6. Specify your payment details. You can select **Skip payment** for now if you're just trying out the setup.
7. Specify a cluster name, review the configuration and cost information, and select **Launch cluster**. In this example, we use `cluster_neon` as the cluster name.
    It may take a few minutes to provision your cluster. After the cluster has provisioned, the **Cluster Overview** page displays.

## Set up a source connector

To set up a Postgres CDC source connector for Confluent Cloud:

1. On the **Cluster Overview** page, under **Set up connector**, select **Get started**.
2. On the **Connector Plugins** page, enter `Postgres` into the search field.
3. Select the **Postgres CDC Source** connector. This is the [PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-cdc-source-debezium.html). This connector will take a snapshot of the existing data and then monitor and record all subsequent row-level changes to that data.

4. On the **Add Postgres CDC Source connector** page:

    - Select the type of access you want to grant the connector. For the purpose of this guide, we'll select **Global access**, but if you are configuring a production pipeline, Confluent recommends **Granular access**.
    - Click the **Generate API key & download** button to generate an API key and secret that your connector can use to communicate with your Kafka cluster. Your applications will need this API key and secret to make requests to your Kafka cluster. Store the API key and secret somewhere safe. This is the only time youâll see the secret.

    Click **Continue**.

5. On the **Add Postgres CDC Source connector** page:

    - Add the connection details for your Neon database. You can obtain the required details from your Neon connection string, which you can find in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Your connection string will look something like this:

        ```text
        postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
        ```

        Enter the details for **your connection string** into the source connector fields. Based on the sample connection string above, the values would be specified as shown below. Your values will differ.

        - **Database name**: `dbname`
        - **Database server name**: `neon_server` (This is a user-specified value that will represent the logical name of your Postgres server. Confluent uses this name as a namespace in all Kafka topic and schema names. It is also used for Avro schema namespaces if the Avro data format is used. The Kafka topic will be created with the prefix `database.server.name`. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots are allowed.)
        - **SSL mode**: `require`
        - **Database hostname** `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech` (this example shows the portion of a Neon connection string forms the database hostname)
        - **Database port**: `5432` (Neon uses port `5432`)
        - **Database username**: `alex`
        - **Database Password** `AbC123dEf`

    - If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to add the Confluent cluster static IP addresses to your allowlist. For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow). If you do not use Neon's **IP Allow** feature, you can skip this step.

    Click **Continue**.

6. Under **Output Kafka record value format**, select an output format for Kafka record values. The default is `JSON`, so we'll use that format in this guide. Other supported values include `AVRO`, `JSON_SR`, and `PROTOBUF`, which are schema-based message formats. If you use any of these, you must also configure a [Confluent Cloud Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/index.html).

    Expand the **Show advanced configurations** drop-down and set the following values:
    
    - Under **Advanced configuration**
      - Ensure **Slot name** is set to `debezium`. This is the name of the replication slot you created earlier.
      - Set the **Publication name** to `users_publication`, which is the name of the publication you created earlier.
      - Set **Publication auto-create** mode to `disabled`. You've already created your publication.
    - Under **Database details**, set **Tables included** to `public.users`, which is the name of the Neon database table you are replicating from.

    Click **Continue**.

7. For **Connector sizing**, accept the default for the maximum number of [Tasks](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html#tasks). Tasks can be scaled up at a later time for additional throughput capacity. 

    Click **Continue**.

8. Adjust your **Connector name** if desired, and review your **Connector configuration**, which is provided in `JSON` format, as shown below. We'll use the default connector name in this guide.

    ```JSON
    {
      "connector.class": "PostgresCdcSource",
      "name": "PostgresCdcSourceConnector_0",
      "kafka.auth.mode": "KAFKA_API_KEY",
      "kafka.api.key": "2WY3UABFDN7DDFIV",
      "kafka.api.secret": "****************************************************************",
      "schema.context.name": "default",
      "database.hostname": "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech",
      "database.port": "5432",
      "database.user": "alex",
      "database.password": "************",
      "database.dbname": "dbname",
      "database.server.name": "neon_server",
      "database.sslmode": "require",
      "publication.name": "users_publication",
      "publication.autocreate.mode": "all_tables",
      "snapshot.mode": "initial",
      "tombstones.on.delete": "true",
      "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
      "slot.name": "debezium",
      "poll.interval.ms": "1000",
      "max.batch.size": "1000",
      "event.processing.failure.handling.mode": "fail",
      "heartbeat.interval.ms": "0",
      "provide.transaction.metadata": "false",
      "decimal.handling.mode": "precise",
      "binary.handling.mode": "bytes",
      "time.precision.mode": "adaptive",
      "cleanup.policy": "delete",
      "hstore.handling.mode": "json",
      "interval.handling.mode": "numeric",
      "schema.refresh.mode": "columns_diff",
      "output.data.format": "JSON",
      "after.state.only": "true",
      "output.key.format": "JSON",
      "json.output.decimal.format": "BASE64",
      "tasks.max": "1"
    }
    ```

    Click **Continue** to provision the connector, which may take a few monents to complete.


## Verify your Kafka stream

To verify that events are now being published to a Kafka stream in Confluent:

1. Insert a row into your `users` table from the Neon SQL Editor or a `psql` client connect to your Neon database. For example:

    ```sql
    -- Insert a new user
    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('Zhang', 'zhang@example.com');
    ```

2. In Confluent Cloud, navigate to your cluster (`cluster_neon` in this guide) and select **Topics** > **neon_server.public.users** > **Messages**. Your newly inserted data should appear at the top of the list of messages.

## Next steps

With events now being published to a Kafka stream, you can now set up a connection between Confluent and a supported consumer. This is quite simple using a Confluent Connector. For example, you can stream data to [Databricks](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-databricks-delta-lake-sink/databricks-aws-setup.html#), [Snowflake](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-snowflake-sink.html), or one of the other supported consumers. Refer to the Confluent documentation for connector-specific instructions.

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations. 

[Materialize](https://materialize.com/) is a data warehouse for operational workloads, purpose-built for low-latency applications. You can use it to process data at speeds and scales not possible in traditional databases, but without the cost, complexity, or development time of most streaming engines.

In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from your Neon Postgres database to Materialize using the Materialize [PostgreSQL source](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/).

## Prerequisites

- A [Materialize account](https://materialize.com/register/)
- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/)
- Optionally, you can install the [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) command line utility for running commands in both Neon and Materialize. Alternatively, you can run commands from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) and Materialize **SQL Shell**, which require no installation or setup. 

## Enable logical replication

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable** to enable logical replication.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

## Create a publication

After logical replication is enabled in Neon, the next step is to create a publication for the tables that you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. From a `psql` client connected to your Neon database or from the **Neon SQL Editor**, set the [replica identity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-ALTERTABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY) to `FULL` for each table that you want to replicate to Materialize:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE <table1> REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

    `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` ensures that the replication stream includes the previous data of changed rows, in the case of `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. This setting allows Materialize to ingest Postgres data with minimal in-memory state.

2. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate:

    For specific tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION mz_source FOR TABLE <table1>, <table2>;
    ```

    The `mz_source` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables and will later be used to ingest the replication stream.

    Be sure to include only the tables you need. If the publication includes additional tables, Materialize wastes resources on ingesting and then immediately discarding the data from those tables.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Allow inbound traffic

If you use Neon's **IP Allow** feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Materize IP addresses. If you are currently not limiting IP address access in Neon, you can skip this step.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, run this command to find the static egress IP addresses for the Materialize region you are running in:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mz_egress_ips;
    ```

2. In your Neon project, add the IPs to your **IP Allow** list, which you can find in your project's settings. For instructions, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Create an ingestion cluster

In Materialize, a [cluster](https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/key-concepts/#clusters) is an isolated environment, similar to a virtual warehouse in Snowflake. When you create a cluster, you choose the size of its compute resource allocation based on the work you need the cluster to do, whether ingesting data from a source, computing always-up-to-date query results, serving results to clients, or a combination.

In this case, youâll create 1 new cluster containing 1 medium replica for ingesting source data from your Neon Postgres database.

From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, run the `CREATE CLUSTER` command to create the new cluster:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTER ingest_postgres SIZE = 'medium';
```

Materialize recommends starting with a medium [size](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/#size) replica or larger. This helps Materialize quickly process the initial snapshot of the tables in your publication. Once the snapshot is finished, you can right-size the cluster.

## Start ingesting data

Now that youâve configured your database network and created an ingestion cluster, you can connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data. 

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [CREATE SECRET](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the password for the Postgres role you created earlier:

    ```sql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

    You can access the password for your Neon Postgres role from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

2. Use the [CREATE CONNECTION](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-connection/) command to create a connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to use:

    ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
    HOST '<host>',
    PORT 5432,
    USER '<role_name>',
    PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
    SSL MODE 'require',
    DATABASE '<database>'
    );
    ```

    You can find the connection details for your replication role in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. A Neon connection string looks like this:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    - Replace `<host>` with your Neon hostname (e.g., `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`)
    - Replace `<role_name>` with the name of your Postgres role (e.g., `alex`)
    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables you want to replicate to Materialize (e.g., `dbname`)

3. Use the [CREATE SOURCE](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data from the publication you created earlier:

    ```sql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
    IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
    FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
    FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    <Admonition type="tip" title="Tips">
    - To ingest data from specific schemas or tables in your publication, you can use `FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
    - After creating a source, you can incorporate upstream schema changes for specific replicated tables using the `ALTER SOURCE...{ADD | DROP} SUBSOURCE` syntax.
    </Admonition>


## Check the ingestion status

Before Materialize starts consuming a replication stream, it takes a snapshot of the tables in your publication. Until this snapshot is complete, Materialize wonât have the same view of your data as your Postgres database.

In this step, youâll verify that the source is running and then check the status of the snapshotting process.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [mz_source_statuses](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statuses) table to check the overall status of your source:

        ```sql
        WITH
        source_ids AS
        (SELECT id FROM mz_sources WHERE name = 'mz_source')
        SELECT *
        FROM
        mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
            JOIN
            (
                SELECT referenced_object_id
                FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
                WHERE
                object_id IN (SELECT id FROM source_ids)
                UNION SELECT id FROM source_ids
            )
            AS sources
            ON mz_source_statuses.id = sources.referenced_object_id;
            ```

        For each subsource, make sure the status is running. If you see stalled or failed, thereâs likely a configuration issue for you to fix. Check the error field for details and fix the issue before moving on. If the status of any subsource is starting for more than a few minutes, contact [Materialize support](https://materialize.com/docs/support/).


2. Once the source is running, use the [mz_source_statistics](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statistics) table to check the status of the initial snapshot:

        ```sql
        WITH
        source_ids AS
        (SELECT id FROM mz_sources WHERE name = 'mz_source')
        SELECT sources.object_id, bool_and(snapshot_committed) AS snapshot_committed
        FROM
        mz_internal.mz_source_statistics
            JOIN
            (
                SELECT object_id, referenced_object_id
                FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
                WHERE
                object_id IN (SELECT id FROM source_ids)
                UNION SELECT id, id FROM source_ids
            )
            AS sources
            ON mz_source_statistics.id = sources.referenced_object_id
        GROUP BY sources.object_id;
        object_id | snapshot_committed
        ----------|------------------
        u144     | t
        (1 row)
        ```

    Once `snapshot_commited` is `t`, move on to the next step. Snapshotting can take between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset and the size of the cluster replica you chose for your `ingest_postgres` cluster.

## Right-size the cluster

After the snapshotting phase, Materialize starts ingesting change events from the Postgres replication stream. For this work, Materialize generally performs well with an `xsmall` replica, so you can resize the cluster accordingly.

1. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, use the [ALTER CLUSTER](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/alter-cluster/) command to downsize the cluster to `xsmall`:

    ```sql
    ALTER CLUSTER ingest_postgres SET (SIZE 'xsmall');
    ```

    Behind the scenes, this command adds a new `xsmall` replica and removes the `medium` replica.

2. Use the [SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/show-cluster-replicas/) command to check the status of the new replica:

    ```sql
    SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS WHERE cluster = 'ingest_postgres';
        cluster     | replica |  size  | ready
    -----------------+---------+--------+-------
    ingest_postgres | r1      | xsmall | t
    (1 row)
    ```

3. Going forward, you can verify that your new replica size is sufficient as follows:

    a. From a `psql` client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize **SQL Shell**, get the replication slot name associated with your Postgres source from the [mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_postgres_sources) table:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            d.name AS database_name,
            n.name AS schema_name,
            s.name AS source_name,
            pgs.replication_slot
        FROM
            mz_sources AS s
            JOIN mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources AS pgs ON s.id = pgs.id
            JOIN mz_schemas AS n ON n.id = s.schema_id
            JOIN mz_databases AS d ON d.id = n.database_id;
        ```
    
    b. From a `psql` client connected to your Neon database or from the **Neon SQL Editor**, check the replication slot lag, using the replication slot name from the previous step:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            pg_size_pretty(pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn)
            AS replication_lag_bytes
        FROM pg_replication_slots
        WHERE slot_name = '<slot_name>';
        ```

        The result of this query is the amount of data your Postgres cluster must retain in its replication log because of this replication slot. Typically, this means Materialize has not yet communicated back to your Neon Postgres database that it has committed this data. A high value can indicate that the source has fallen behind and that you might need to scale up your ingestion cluster.

## Next steps

With Materialize ingesting your Postgres data into durable storage, you can start exploring the data, computing real-time results that stay up-to-date as new data arrives, and serving results efficiently.

- Explore your data with [SHOW SOURCES](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/show-sources) and [SELECT](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/).
- Compute real-time results in memory with [CREATE VIEW](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/) and [CREATE INDEX](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-index/) or in durable storage with [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/).
- Serve results to a Postgres-compatible SQL client or driver with [SELECT](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/) or [SUBSCRIBE](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/subscribe/) or to an external message broker with [CREATE SINK](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-sink/).
- Check out the [tools and integrations](https://materialize.com/docs/integrations/) supported by Materialize.

Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from Neon to external subscribers. This guide shows you how to stream data from a Neon Postgres database to an external Postgres database.

You will learn how to enable logical replication in Neon, create a publication, and configure an external Postgres database as a subscriber.

## Enable logical replication

<Admonition type="important">
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL `wal_level` configuration parameter, changing it from `replica` to `logical` for all databases in your Neon project. Once the `wal_level` setting is changed to `logical`, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
</Admonition>

To enable logical replication in Neon:

1. Select your project in the Neon console.
2. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Beta**.
4. Click **Enable**.

You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
 wal_level 
-----------
 logical
```

After enabling logical replication, the next steps involve creating publications on your replication source database in Neon and configuring subscriptions on the destination system or service. These processes are the same as those you would perform in a standalone Postgres environment. 

## Create a publication

Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They allow you to specify a set of database changes that can be replicated to subscribers. This section walks you through creating a publication for a `users` table.

1. Create the `users` table in your Neon database. You can do this via the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or by connecting to your Neon database from an SQL client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

2. To create a publication for the `users` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION users_publication FOR TABLE users;
    ```

This command creates a publication named `users_publication`, which will include all changes to the `users` table in your replication stream.

With your publication created, you're now ready to configure a subscriber that will receive the data changes from this publication.

## Create a Postgres role for replication

It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the `REPLICATION` privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon Console, CLI, or API are granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which has the required `REPLICATION` privilege.

<Tabs labels={["Neon Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>

To create a role in the Neon Console:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select a project.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select the branch where you want to create the role.
4. Click **New Role**.
5. In the role creation dialog, specify a role name.
6. Click **Create**. The role is created, and you are provided with the password for the role.

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see [Neon CLI commands â roles](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectbranchrole)

```bash
neonctl roles create --name <role>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](/docs/reference/cli-roles).

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/branches/br-blue-tooth-671580/roles' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "role": {
    "name": "alex"
  }
}' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Grant schema access to your Postgres role

If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. Run these commands for each schema:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <role_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <role_name>;
```

Granting `SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.

## Configure PostgreSQL as a subscriber

A subscriber is a destination that receives data changes from your publications. 

This section describes how to configure a subscription on a standalone Postgres instance to a publication defined on your Neon database. After the subscription is defined, the destination Postgres instance will be able to receive data changes from the publication defined on your Neon database.

It is assumed that you have a separate Postgres instance ready to act as the subscriber. This must be a Postgres instance other than Neon, such as a local PostgreSQL installation. Currently, a Neon database cannot be defined as a subscriber. The PostgreSQL version of the subscriber should be compatible with the publisher. The primary (publishing) server must be of the same or a higher version than the replica (subscribing) server. For example, you can replicate from PostgreSQL 14 to 16, but not from 16 to 14. Neon supports Postgres 14, 15, and 16. The Postgres version is defined when you create a Neon project.

### Allow inbound traffic

Configure `pg_hba.conf`, which is located in the same directory as `postgresql.conf`, to allow replication connections from your Neon database host:

    You can set the IP address to `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from any IP. However, this is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns.

    ```ini
    host replication <replication_username> 0.0.0.0/0 md5
    ```

    It's safer to specify the IP address of your publishing Neon database. You can use a tool like `nslookup` to find the IP address of your Neon host, which you can obtain from your Neon connection string. For example:

    ```bash
    nslookup ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
    ```

    Then, update `pg_hba.conf` with that IP address:

    ```ini
    host replication <replication_username> 192.0.2.1/32 md5
    ```

    Apply the changes by reloading the PostgreSQL configuration:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_reload_conf();
    ```

### Create a subscription

1. Use `psql` or another SQL client to connect to your subscriber Postgres database.
2. Create the subscription using the using a `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` statement. This example creates a subscription for the `user` table publication (`users_publication`) that you created previously.

    ```sql
    CREATE SUBSCRIPTION users_subscription 
    CONNECTION 'postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname' 
    PUBLICATION users_publication;
    ```

    - `subscription_name`: A name you chose for the subscription.
    - `connection_string`: The connection string for your Neon database, where you defined the publication.
    - `publication_name`: The name of the publication you created on your Neon database.

3. Verify the subscription was created by running the following command: 

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
    ```

    The subscription (`users_subscription`) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been successfully created.

## Test the replication

Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber (from your Neon database to your standalone Postgres instance).

First, generate some changes in the `users` table on the publisher database to see if these changes are replicated to the subscriber:

1. Connect to your Neon database (the publisher) and perform an `INSERT` operation. For example:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('new_user', 'new_user@example.com');
    ```

2. After making changes, query the `users` table on the publisher to confirm your `INSERT`:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

    Note the changes you made for comparison with the subscriber's data.

3. Now, connect to your subscriber database on your standalone Postgres instance:

    ```bash
    psql -h [server_IP_or_hostname] -U [username] -d [database] -W
    ```

4. Query the `users` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

  Compare the results with what you observed on the publisher.

4. On the subscriber, you can also check the status of the replication:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
    ```

    Look for the `last_msg_receive_time` to confirm that the subscription is active and receiving data.

The [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) lets you share your Neon project with other users, giving them access to your Neon project from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console, Neon API, and Neon CLI. Follow this guide to learn how.

## Set up Neon accounts

You can share your Neon project with anyone. The only requirement is that the user has a Neon account. The account can be a Neon Free Tier account or Neon Pro Plan account.

1. If the user does not have a Neon account, ask them to sign up. You can provide your users with the following instructions: [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
2. Request the email address the user signed up with. If the user signed up with a Google or GitHub account, ask for the email address associated with that account.

## Share your project

After a user has provided you with the email address associated with their Neon account, you can share your project with that user.

To share your project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
2. Select the project you want to share.
1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, select **Settings** from the sidebar.
1. On the **Settings** page, select **Sharing**.
1. Under **Grant access to your project**, enter the email address of the account you want to share your project with.
    ![Grant access to a project](/docs/guides/sharing_grant_access.png)
1. Click **Grant access**. The email you specify is added to the list of **People who have access to the project**.
    ![People with access](/docs/guides/sharing_people_with_access.png)

    The Neon account associated with the email address is granted full access to the project with the exception privileges required to delete the project. When the user logs in to Neon, the shared project is listed on their **Projects** page, under **Shared with me**.

    ![Project shared with me](/docs/guides/shared_with_me.png)

    An email is also sent to the email address informing the user that a project has been shared with them. The email includes an **Open project** link the user can click on to log in to Neon. After logging in, the user is directed to the **Dashboard** for the shared project in the Neon Console.

## Shared project limits

The users you share a project with operate within your Neon Pro Plan project limits rather than their Neon Free Tier project limits when using your project. For example, a Neon Free Tier user is limited to 10 branches in their own project. When using your project, there is no such restriction. For an overview of plan limits, see [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

## Access to a shared project via the Neon API or CLI

The users you share a project with are able to access the project from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console, [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), and [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli).

Users can access a shared project via the Neon API using an API key from their own Neon account. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

When using the Neon CLI, users authenticate as they would normally. Users are able able to access their own Neon projects as well as shared projects. See [Neon CLI â Connect](/docs/reference/cli-install#connect) for authentication instructions.

## Shared project billing

The costs associated with a shared project are charged to the Neon account that owns the project. For example, if you share your project with another Neon user account, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Neon account.

---

[Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) are supported with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). This guide will lead you through the process of creating and managing read replicas.

The general methodology of using read replicas to segregate read-only work from your production database operations can be applied to a variety of uses cases, such as:

- Offloading analytics or reporting queries
- Distributing read requests to achieve higher throughput
- Providing read-only data access to specific users or applications who do not need to modify data
- Configuring different CPU and memory resources for each read replica for different users and applications

Regardless of the application, the steps for creating, configuring, and connecting to a read replica are the same. You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the vCPU and memory allocated to each. Neon's _Autoscaling_ and _Auto-suspend_ features are also supported, providing you with control over compute usage.

## Prerequisites

- A [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account.
- A [Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to a branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint to any branch in your Neon project using the Neon Console, [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create), or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To create a read replica from the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable **Autoscaling** and configure a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is automatically suspended. The default setting is 5 minutes. You can set this value up 7 days.
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
    </Admonition>
6. When you have finished making your selections, click **Create**.

In a few moments, your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page. This is your read replica. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>

To create a read replica using the Neon CLI, use the [branches](/docs/reference/cli-branches) command, specifying the `add-compute` subcommand with `--type read_only`. If you have more than one Neon project, also include the `--project-id` option.  


```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint. To create a read-only compute endpoint using the Neon API,  use the [Create endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) method. The `type` attribute in the following example specifies `read_only`, which creates a read-only compute endpoint. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `branch_id` parameters, refer to [Create an endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "<branch_id>"
  }
}
' | jq
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Connect to a read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select a **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select a connection string or a code example from the drop-down menu and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

    A **psql** connection string appears similar to the following:

    ```bash
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string or example.

    When you use a read-only connection string, you are connecting to a read replica. No write operations are permitted on this connection.

## View read replicas

You can view read replicas using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint).

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To view read replicas for a branch, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. Under the **Computes** heading, the **Type** field identifies your read replicas. Read replicas have a `R/O` value instead of `R/W`.

![View read replicas](/docs/guides/view_read_replica.png)
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint.  To view read-only compute endpoints with the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), use the [Get endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints) method. 

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

For information about obtaining the required `project_id` parameter for this command, refer to [Get endpoints](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectendpoints), in the _Neon API reference_. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

In the response body for this method, read replica compute endpoints are identified by the `type` value, which is `read_only`.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Edit a read replica

You can edit a read replica using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) to change the [Compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Auto-suspend](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To edit a read-only compute endpoint using the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, identify the read-only compute endpoint you want to modify, click the compute endpoint menu, and select **Edit**.
1. Specify your **Compute size** or **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** changes and click **Save**.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint. To edit a read-only compute endpoint with the Neon API, use the [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint) method. 

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints/<endpoint_id> \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY` \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "autoscaling_limit_min_cu": 25,
    "autoscaling_limit_max_cu": 3,
    "suspend_timeout_seconds": 604800,
    "provisioner": "k8s-neonvm"
  }
}
'
```

Compute endpoints are identified by their `project_id` and `endpoint_id`. For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `endpoint_id` parameters, refer to [Update endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Delete a read replica

You can delete a read replica using the Neon Console or [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Deleting a read replica is a permanent action, but you can quickly create a new read replica if you need one.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
To delete a read replica using the Neon Console:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, find the read-only compute endpoint you want to delete. Read replicas have a `R/O` type.
1. Click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.
</TabItem>

<TabItem>
In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint. To delete a read-only compute endpoint with the Neon API, use the [Delete endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectendpoint) method. 

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/endpoints/<endpoint_id> \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEYâ
```

Compute endpoints are identified by their `project_id` and `endpoint_id`.

updatedOn: '2023-11-27T16:33:52.718Z'

With Neon's read replica feature, you can instantly create a dedicated read-only compute instance for running data-intensive analytics or reporting queries. This allows you to avoid disruption or performance degradation on your production database.

A read replica reads data from the same source as your read-write compute instance. There's no data replication, so creating a read replica is a near-instant process. For more information about Neon's read replica architecture, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

Suppose you have a `sales` table in your production database. The table and data might look something like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO sales (product_id, sale_amount, sale_date) VALUES
(1, 20.50, '2022-07-24'),
(2, 35.99, '2022-08-24'),
(1, 20.50, '2022-09-24'),
(3, 15.00, '2023-01-24'),
(1, 20.50, '2023-04-24');
...
```

You want to find the total sale amount for each product in the past year, but due to the large number of products and sales in your database, you know it's a costly query that could impact performance on your production system.

This guide walks you through creating a read replica, connecting to it, running your query, and optionally deleting the read replica when finished.

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to a branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint to any branch in your Neon project by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a fixed size compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable _Autoscaling_ by configuring a minimum and maximum compute size using the slider. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your compute automatically suspends due to inactivity. The default setting is 5 minutes. You can set this value up to 7 days.
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
    </Admonition>
6. When you finish making your selections, click **Create**.

Your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page. This is your read replica. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

<CodeTabs labels={["API", "CLI"]}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Connect to the read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select the **RO-replica** compute endpoint.
1. Select a **Database** and the **Role** you want to connect with.
1. Copy the connection string. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

    The connection string appears similar to the following:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string.

    The information in your connection string corresponds to the following connection details:

    - role: `alex`
    - password:`AbC123dEf`
    - hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
    - database name: `dbname`. Your database name may differ.

    When you connect to a read-only compute, no write operations are permitted on the connection.

1. Connect to your application from a client such as `psql` or add the connection details to your application. For example, to connect using `psql`, issue the following command:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    psql postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

## Run the analytics query on the read replica

An analytics query on your `sales` table might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(sale_amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year')
GROUP BY product_id;
```

If you have a lot of products and sales, this query might impact performance on your production system, but running the query on your read replica, which has its own dedicated compute resources, causes no disruption.

## Delete the read replica

When you are finished running analytics queries, you can delete the read replica if it's no longer required. Deleting a read replica is a permanent action, but you can quickly create a new read replica when you need one.

To delete a read replica:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, find the read-only compute endpoint you want to delete. Read replicas have a `RO replica` type.
1. Click the compute endpoint menu on the right side of the table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-24T18:56:54.985Z'
---

A Neon read replica is an independent read-only compute instance that performs read operations on the same data as your read-write compute, which means adding a read replica to a Neon project requires no additional storage.

A key benefit of read replicas is that you can distribute read requests to one or more read replica compute instances, enabling you to easily scale your applications and achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.

For more information about Neon's read replica feature, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

In this guide, we'll show you how you can leverage Neon read replicas to efficiently scale Prisma applications using Prisma Client's read replica extension: [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas).

## Prerequisites

- An application that uses Prisma with a Neon database.
- A [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account. Read replicas are a Neon Pro Plan feature.

## Create a read replica

You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project. Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to the Neon branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable **Autoscaling** and configure a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is automatically suspended. The default setting is 5 minutes. You can set this value up to 7 days.
   <Admonition type="note">
   The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
   </Admonition>
6. When you finish making selections, click **Create**.

   Your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

<CodeTabs labels={["API", "CLI"]}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Retrieve the connection string for your read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch in a Neon project, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to retrieve the connection string (the URL) for a read replica from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select your **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select the connection string and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from your Prisma Client. The connection string appears similar to the following:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

   If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string, but remember to append `?pgbouncer=true` to the connection string when using a pooled connection. Prisma requires this flag when using Prisma Client with PgBouncer. See [Use connection pooling with Prisma](/docs/guides/prisma#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma) for more information.

## Update your env file

In your `.env` file, set a `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your read replica. Your `.env` file should look something like this, with your regular `DATABASE_URL` and the newly added `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL`.

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
DATABASE_REPLICA_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-damp-cell-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Notice that the `endpoint_id` (`ep-damp-cell-123456`) for the read replica compute differs. The read replica is a different compute instance and therefore has a different `endpoint_id`.

## Configure Prisma Client to use a read replica

[@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) adds support to Prisma Client for read replicas. The following steps show you how to install the extension and configure it to use a Neon read replica.

1. Install the extension in your Prisma project:

   ```bash
   npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
   ```

2. Extend your Prisma Client instance by importing the extension and adding the `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable as shown:

   ```javascript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
   import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas';

   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
     readReplicas({
       url: DATABASE_REPLICA_URL,
     })
   );
   ```

   <Admonition type="note">
   You can also pass an array of read replica connection strings if you want to use multiple read replicas. Neon supports adding multiple read replicas to a database branch.

   ```javascript
   // lib/prisma.ts
   const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
     readReplicas({
       url: [process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_1, process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_2],
     })
   );
   ```

   </Admonition>

   When your application runs, read operations are sent to the read replica. If you specify multiple read replicas, a read replica is selected randomly.

   All write and `$transaction` queries are sent to the primary compute endpoint defined by `DATABASE_URL`, which is your read/write compute endpoint.

   If you want to read from the primary compute endpoint and bypass read replicas, you can use the `$primary()` method in your extended Prisma Client instance:

   ```bash
   const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
   ```

   This Prisma Client query will be routed to your primary database.

## Examples

This example demonstrates how to use the [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) extension in Prisma Client. It uses a simple TypeScript script to read and write data in a Postgres database.

With each Neon project, Neon creates  a "neon" extension, which includes functions and views designed to gather Neon-specific metrics. The metrics are intended for use by the Neon team for the purpose of enhancing our service. The views are owned by a Neon system role (`cloud_admin`), but you are able to view them by connecting to the `postgres` database using `psql` and executing the command `\dv neon.*`, as shown below. At present, the extension includes two views for local file cache metrics. We may incorporate additional views in future releases.

# neon_utils

title: The neon_utils extension
subtitle: Monitor how Neon's Autoscaling feature allocates compute resources
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-27T16:33:52.713Z'
---

The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature allocates vCPU in response to workload. The function returns the current number of allocated vCPUs.

For information about Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Install the `neon_utils` extension

Install the `neon_utils` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION neon_utils;
```

For information about using the Neon **SQL Editor**, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Use the `num_cpus()` function

In Neon, computing capacity is measured in _Compute Units (CU)_. One CU is 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CU is 2 vCPU and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPU. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 7 CU.

Defining a minimum and maximum compute size for your compute endpoint, as shown below, enables _Autoscaling_.

![Edit compute endpoint dialog showing an Autoscaling configuration](/docs/extensions/edit_compute_endpoint.png)

As your workload changes, computing capacity scales dynamically between the minimum and maximum settings defined in your compute endpoint configuration. To retrieve the number of allocated vCPU at any point in time, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT num_cpus();
```

For _Autoscaling_ configuration instructions, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply:

- The `num_cpus()` function does not return fractional vCPU sizes. The _Autoscaling_ feature can scale by fractional vCPU, but the `num_cpus()` function reports the next whole number. For example, if the current number of allocated vCPU is `.25` or `.5`, the `num_cpus()` function returns `1`.
- The `num_cpus()` function only works on compute endpoints that have the _Autoscaling_ feature enabled. Running the function on a fixed size compute endpoint does not return a correct value.

## Observe Autoscaling with `neon_utils` and `pgbench`

The following instructions demonstrate how you can use the `num_cpus()` function with `pgbench` to observe how Neon's Autoscaling feature responds to workload.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that _Autoscaling_ is enabled for your compute endpoint. For instructions, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration). The following example uses a minimum setting of 0.25 Compute Units (CU) and a maximum of 4.
- The [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) utility.

### Run the test

1. Install the `neon_utils` extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS neon_utils;
    ```

2. Create a `test.sql` file with the following queries:

    ```sql
    SELECT LOG(factorial(5000)) / LOG(factorial(2500));
    SELECT txid_current();
    ```

3. To avoid errors when running `pgbench`, initialize your database with the tables used by `pgbench`. This can be done using the `pgbench -i` command, specifying the connection string for your Neon database. You can obtain a connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    pgbench -i postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

4. Run a `pgbench` test with your `test.sql` file, specifying your connection string:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    pgbench -f test.sql -c 15 -T 1000 -P 1 postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    The test produces output similar to the following on a compute endpoint set to scale from 0.25 to 4 CUs.

    ```bash
    pgbench (15.3)
    starting vacuum...end.

Next.js by Vercel is an open-source web development framework that enables React-based web applications. This topic describes how to create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application.

To create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Next.js project and add dependencies](#create-a-nextjs-project-and-add-dependencies)
3. [Configure a Postgres client](#configure-the-postgres-client)
4. [Run the app](#run-the-app)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a Next.js project and add dependencies

1. Create a Next.js project if you do not have one. For instructions, see [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup), in the Vercel documentation.

2. Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:

    <CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

      ```shell
      npm install pg
      ```

      ```shell
      npm install postgres
      ```
      
      ```shell
      npm install @neondatabase/serverless
      ```

    </CodeTabs>

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

</CodeBlock>

## Configure the Postgres client

There a multiple ways to make server side requests with Next.js. See below for the different implementations.

### App Router

From your server functions using the App Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

async function getData() {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return response.rows[0];
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

async function getData() {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return response;
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

async function getData() {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return response;
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
}

```

</CodeTabs>

### Pages Router

There are two methods for fetching data using server-side requests in Next.js they are:

1. `getServerSideProps` fetches data at runtime so that content is always fresh.
2. `getStaticProps` pre-renders pages at build time for data that is static or changes infrequently.

#### getServerSideProps

From `getServerSideProps` using the Pages Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true
});

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return { props: { data: response.rows[0] } };
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return { props: { data: response } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {}
```

```javascript

## Configure the Postgres client

There are two parts to connecting a Remix application to Neon. The first is `db.server`. Remix will ensure any code added to this file won't be included in the client bundle. The second is the route where the connection to the database will be used. 

### db.server

Create a `db.server.ts` file at the root of your `/app` directory and add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:


<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';

const pool = new pg.Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: true,
});

export { pool };
```

```javascript
import postgres from 'postgres';

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { ssl: 'require' });

export { sql };
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

export { sql };
```
</CodeTabs>

### route

Create a new route in your `app/routes` directory and import the `db.server` file.  

<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js", "Neon serverless driver"]}>

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { pool } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const client = await pool.connect();

  try {
    const response = await client.query('SELECT version()');
    console.log(response.rows[0]);
    return json({ data: response.rows[0] });
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { sql } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return json({ data: response });
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```

```javascript
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';
import { sql } from '~/db.server';

export const loader = async () => {
  const response = await sql`SELECT version()`;
  console.log(response);
  return json({ data: response });
};

export default function Page() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
}
```
</CodeTabs>

title: Connect from Elixir with Ecto to Neon
subtitle: Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from Elixir with Ecto
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.751Z'
---

This guide describes how to connect from an Elixir application with Ecto, which is a database wrapper and query generator for Elixir. Ecto provides an API and abstractions for interacting databases, enabling Elixir developers to query any database using similar constructs.

The instructions in this guide follow the steps outlined in the [Ecto Getting Started](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#content) guide, modified to demonstrate connecting to a Neon Serverless Postgres database. It is assumed that you have a working installation of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

To connect to Neon from Elixir with Ecto:

1. [Create a database in Neon and copy the connection string](#create-a-database-in-neon-and-copy-the-connection-string)
2. [Create an Elixir project](#create-an-elixir-project)
3. [Add Ecto and Postgrex to the application](#add-ecto-and-postgrex-to-the-application)
4. [Configure Ecto](#configure-ecto)
5. [Create a migration and add a table](#create-a-migration-and-add-a-table)
6. [Next steps](#next-steps)

## Create a database in Neon and copy the connection string

The instructions in this configuration use a database named `friends`.

To create the database:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Databases**.
1. Select the branch where you want to create the database.
1. Click **New Database**.
1. Enter a database name (`friends`), and select a database owner.
1. Click **Create**.

You can obtain the connection string for the database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you. Your connection string should look something like this:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/friends
```

</CodeBlock>

You will need the connection string details later in the setup.

## Create an Elixir project

Create an Elixir application called `friends`.

```bash
mix new friends --sup
```

The `--sup` option ensures that the application has a supervision tree, which is required by Ecto.

## Add Ecto and Postgrex to the application

1. Add the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies to the `mix.exs` file by updating the `deps` definition in the file to include those items. For example:

    ```bash
    defp deps do
      [
        {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.0"},
        {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"}
      ]
    end
    ```

    Ecto provides the common querying API. The Postgrex driver acts as a bridge between Ecto and Postgres. Ecto interfaces with its own `Ecto.Adapters.Postgres` module, which communicates to Postgres through the Postgrex driver.

2. Install the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies by running the following command in your application directory:

    ```bash
    mix deps.get
    ```

## Configure Ecto

Run the following command in your application directory to generate the configuration required to connect from Ecto to your Neon database.

```bash
mix ecto.gen.repo -r Friends.Repo
```

Follow these steps to complete the configuration:

1. The first part of the configuration generated by the `mix ecto.gen.repo` command is found in the `config/config.exs` file. Update this configuration with your Neon database connection details. Use the connection details from the Neon connection string you copied in the first part of the guide. Your `hostname` will differ from the example below.

    ```elixir
    config :friends, Friends.Repo,
      database: "friends",
      username: "alex",
      password: "AbC123dEf",
      hostname: "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech",
      ssl: true,
      ssl_opts: [
        server_name_indication: 'ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech',
        verify: :verify_none
      ]
    ```

    The `ssl: true` and `ssl_opts` settings are required to connect to Neon. Neon uses domain names provided via the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to route incoming connections. Enabling `ssl` and setting `ssl_opts` with the `server_name_indication` option set to your Neon hostname ensures that this information is passed to Neon when making a connection. The `verify: :verify_none` setting tells Ecto to ignore SSL certificate verification when connecting to your database, but keep in mind that it is better to use SSL with proper certificate verification. That `ssl_opts` configuration is as follows:

    ```elixir
    ssl_opts: [
      cacertfile: "/path/to/certfile.crt",
      verify: :verify_peer,
      server_name_indication: to_charlist('ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech'),
      customize_hostname_check: [
        # By default, Erlang does not support wildcard certificates. This function supports validating wildcard hosts
        match_fun: :public_key.pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun(:https)
      ]
    ]
    ```

2. The second part of the configuration generated by the `mix ecto.gen.repo` command is the `Ecto.Repo` module, found in `lib/friends/repo.ex`. You shouldn't have to make any changes here, but verify that the following configuration is present:

    ```elixir
    defmodule Friends.Repo do
    use Ecto.Repo,
        otp_app: :friends,
        adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
    end
    ```

    Ecto uses the module definition to query the database. The `otp_app` setting tells Ecto where to find the database configuration. In this case, the `:friends` application is specified, so Ecto will use the configuration defined in the that application's `config/config.exs` file. The `:adapter` option defines the Postgres adapter.

3. Next, the `Friends.Repo` must be defined as a supervisor within the application's supervision tree. In `lib/friends/application.ex`, make sure `Friends.Repo` is specified in the `start` function, as shown:

    ```elixir
    def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
        Friends.Repo,
    ]
    ```

    This configuration starts the Ecto process, enabling it to receive and execute the application's queries.

4. The final part of the configuration is to add the following line under the configuration in the `config/config.exs` file that you updated in the first step:

    ```elixir
    config :friends, ecto_repos: [Friends.Repo]
    ```

    This line tells the application about the new repo, allowing you to run commands such as `mix ecto.migrate`, which you will use in a later step to create a table in your database.

## Create a migration and add a table

Your `friends` database is currently empty. It has no tables or data. In this step, you will add a table. To do so, you will create a "migration" by running the following command in your application directory:

```bash
mix ecto.gen.migration create_people
```

The command generates an empty migration file in `priv/repo/migrations`, which looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do

  end
end
```

Add code to the migration file to create a table called `people`. For example:

```elixir
defmodule Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:people) do
      add :first_name, :string
      add :last_name, :string
      add :age, :integer
    end
  end
end
```

To run the migration and create the `people` table in your database, which also verifies your connection to Neon, run the following command from your application directory:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

The output of this command should appear similar to the following:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
14:30:04.924 [info]  == Running 20230524172817 Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople.change/0 forward
14:30:04.925 [info]  create table people
14:30:05.014 [info]  == Migrated 20230524172817 in 0.0s
```

</CodeBlock>

You can use the **Tables** feature in the Neon Console to view the table that was created:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select a project.
1. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
1. Select the Branch, Database (`friends`), and the schema (`public`). You should see the `people` table along with a `schema_migration` table that was created by the migration.

## Application code

You can find the application code for the example above on GitHub.

</DetailIconCards>

## Next steps

The [Ecto Getting Started Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#content) provides additional steps that you can follow to create a schema, insert data, and run queries. See [Creating the schema](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#creating-the-schema ) in the _Ecto Getting Started Guide_ to pick up where the steps in this guide leave off.

## Usage notes

- Suppose you have `PGHOST` environment variable on your system set to something other than your Neon hostname. In that case, this hostname will be used instead of the Neon `hostname` defined in your Ecto Repo configuration when running `mix ecto` commands. To avoid this issue, you can either set the `PGHOST` environment variable to your Neon hostname or specify `PGHOST=""` when running `mix ecto` commands; for example: `PGHOST="" mix ecto.migrate`.
- By default, Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature scales computes to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity, which can result in a `connection not available` error when running `mix ecto` commands. Typically, a Neon compute takes a few seconds to transition from `Idle` to `Active`. Wait a few seconds and try running the command again. Alternatively, consider the strategies outlined in [Connection latency and timeouts](/docs/connect/connection-latency) to manage connection issues resulting from compute suspension.

You now have a Quarkus project in a folder named `neon-with-quarkus-jdbc` with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, Agroal datasource implementation, and RESTEasy Reactive extensions installed.

## Configure a PostgreSQL data source

Create a `.env` file in the root of your Quarkus project directory. Configure a JDBC data source using the components of your Neon database connection string and specifying the database kind as shown:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```shell
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_DB_KIND=postgresql
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=[user]
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=[password]
# Note that "jdbc" is prepended, and that "?sslmode=require" is appended to the connection string
QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="note">
You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).
</Admonition>

## Use the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver

Create a `PostgresResource.java` file in the same directory as the `GreetingResource.java` that was generated by Quarkus during project creation. Paste the following content into the `PostgresResource.java` file:

```java
package com.neon.tech;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import javax.sql.DataSource;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/postgres")
public class PostgresResource {
    @Inject
    DataSource dataSource;

    @GET
    @Path("/version")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getVersion() {
        try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
                Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {

            ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT version()");

            if (resultSet.next()) {
                return resultSet.getString(1);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

This code defines a HTTP endpoint that will query the database version and return it as a response to incoming requests.

## Run the application

Start the application in development mode using the Quarkus CLI from the root of the project directory:

```shell
quarkus dev
```

Visit [localhost:8080/postgres/version](http://localhost:8080/postgres/version) in your web browser. Your Neon database's Postgres version will be returned. For example:

```
PostgreSQL 15.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit

This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or from a Spring Data project that uses JDBC.

The JDBC API is a Java API for relational databases. Postgres has a well-supported open-source JDBC driver which can be used to access Neon. All popular Java frameworks use JDBC internally. To connect to Neon, you are only required to provide a connection URL.

For additional information about JDBC, refer to the JDBC API documentation, and the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation).

To connect to Neon with JDBC or from a Spring Data project:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Connect with JDBC](#connect-with-jdbc) or [Connect from Spring Data](#connect-from-spring-data)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Connect with JDBC

For a JDBC connection URL, replace the variables in the following URL string with your Neon project ID, database name, user, and password:

```java
jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require 
```


You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Connect from Spring Data

Spring Data relies on JDBC and Postgres drivers to connect to Postgres databases, such as Neon. If you are starting your project with Spring Initializr or connecting from an existing Spring Data project, ensure that the `PostgreSQL database driver` dependency is installed.

Connecting from a Spring Data project requires specifying the datasource URL in your `application.properties` file, as shown in the following example:

```java
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
```

Refer to the [Connect with JDBC](#connect-with-jdbc) section above for information about obtaining connection details for your Neon database.

Prisma is an open-source, next-generation ORM that lets you to manage and interact with your database. This guide covers the following topics:

- [Connect to Neon from Prisma](#connect-to-neon-from-prisma)
- [Use connection pooling with Prisma](#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma)
- [Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma](#use-the-neon-serverless-driver-with-prisma)
- [Connection timeouts](#connection-timeouts)
- [Connection pool timeouts](#connection-pool-timeouts)
- [JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas](#json-protocol-for-large-prisma-schemas)

## Connect to Neon from Prisma

To establish a basic connection from Prisma to Neon, perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve your Neon connection string. In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
  ![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)
  The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

2. Add the following lines to your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to identify the data source and database URL:

   ```typescript
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url   = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. Add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding `?sslmode=require` to the end of the connection string to ensure a [secure connection](/docs/connect/connect-securely).

   Your setting will appear similar to the following:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```text
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="important">
If you plan to use Prisma Client from a serverless function, see [Use connection pooling with Prisma](#use-connection-pooling-with-prisma) for additional configuration instructions. To adjust your connection string to avoid connection timeout issues, see [Connection timeouts](#connection-timeouts).
</Admonition>

## Use connection pooling with Prisma

Serverless functions can end up requiring a large number of database connections as demand increases. If you use serverless functions in your application, it is recommended that you use a pooled Neon connection string with the `pgbouncer=true` option, as shown:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```ini
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true"
```

</CodeBlock>

- A pooled Neon connection string adds `-pooler` to the endpoint ID, which tells Neon to use a pooled connection. You can add `-pooler` to your connection string manually or copy a pooled connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Use the **Pooled connection** checkbox to add the `-pooler` suffix.
- Neon uses PgBouncer to provide [connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling). Prisma requires the `pgbouncer=true` flag when using Prisma Client with PgBouncer, as described in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management/configure-pg-bouncer#add-pgbouncer-to-the-connection-url).
- Both the pooled Neon connection string and the `pgbouncer=true` flag are required to use Noen's connection pooler with Prisma. See the example above.

### Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate

You cannot use a pooled connection for certain operations in Prisma that require a direct connection to the database; for example, schema migration with Prisma Migrate. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as `prisma migrate dev`, with a pooled connection causes the following error:

```text
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
```

To avoid this issue, make sure you are using a direct connection to the database for Prisma Migrate. Neon supports both pooled and direct connections to the same database.

You can configure a direct connection while allowing applications to use Prisma Client with a pooled connection by adding a `directUrl` property to the datasource block in your `schema.prisma` file. For example:

```typescript
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
The `directUrl` property is available in Prisma version [4.10.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.10.0) and higher. For more information about this property, refer to the [Prisma schema reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields).
</Admonition>

After adding the `directUrl` property to your `schema.prisma` file, update the `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` variables settings in your `.env` file:

1. Set `DATABASE_URL` to the pooled connection string for your Neon database. Applications that require a pooled connection should use this connection.
1. Set `DIRECT_URL` to the direct (non-pooled) connection string. This is the direct connection to the database required by Prisma Migrate. Other Prisma CLI operations may also require a direct connection.

When you finish updating your `.env` file, your variable settings should appear similar to the following:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```ini
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true"

# Unpooled Neon connection string
DIRECT_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

</CodeBlock>

## Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma

The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that lets you query data from serverless and edge environments. For more information about the driver, see [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver).

To set up Prisma with the Neon serverless driver, use the Prisma driver adapter. This adapter allows you to choose a different database driver than Prisma's default driver for communicating with your database.

The Prisma driver adapter feature is available in **Preview** in Prisma version 5.4.2 and later.

To get started, enable the `driverAdapters` Preview feature flag in your `schema.prisma` file, as shown:

```javascript
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, generate the Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Install the Prisma adapter for Neon, the Neon serverless driver, and `ws` packages:

```bash
npm install @prisma/adapter-neon @neondatabase/serverless ws
npm install --save-dev @types/ws
```

Update your Prisma Client instance:

```javascript
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { PrismaNeon } from '@prisma/adapter-neon'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import ws from 'ws'

dotenv.config()
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws
const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString })
const adapter = new PrismaNeon(pool)
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
```

You can now use Prisma Client as you normally would with full type-safety. Prisma Migrate, introspection, and Prisma Studio will continue working as before, using the Neon connection string defined by the `DATABASE_URL` variable in your `schema.prisma` file.

## Connection timeouts

A connection timeout that occurs when connecting from Prisma to Neon causes an error similar to the following:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
```

</CodeBlock>

This error most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before the Neon compute was activated.

A Neon compute has two main states: _Active_ and _Idle_. Active means that the compute is currently running. If there is no query activity for 5 minutes, Neon places a compute into an idle state by default.

When you connect to an idle compute from Prisma, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds but added latency can result in a connection timeout. To address this issue, you can adjust your Neon connection string by adding a `connect_timeout` parameter. This parameter defines the maximum number of seconds to wait for a new connection to be opened. The default value is 5 seconds. A higher setting may provide the time required to avoid connection timeouts. For example:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10"
```

</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="note">
A `connect_timeout` setting of 0 means no timeout.
</Admonition>

## Connection pool timeouts

Another possible cause of timeouts is [Prisma's connection pool](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/). The Prisma query engine manages a pool of connections. The pool is instantiated when a Prisma Client opens a first connection to the database. For an explanation of how this connection pool functions, read [How the connection pool works](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool#how-the-connection-pool-works), in the _Prisma documentation_.

The default size of the Prisma connection pool is determined by the following formula: `num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1`,  where `num_physical_cpus` represents the number of physical CPUs on the machine where your application runs. For example, if your machine has four physical CPUs, your connection pool will contain nine connections (4 * 2 + 1 = 9). As mentioned in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-prismaclient/connection-pool#default-connection-pool-size), this formula is a good starting point, but the recommended connection limit also depends on your deployment paradigm â particularly if you are using serverless. You can specify the number of connections explicitly by setting the `connection_limit` parameter in your database connection URL. For example:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20"
```

</CodeBlock>

For configuration guidance, refer to Prisma's [Recommended connection pool size guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#recommended-connection-pool-size).

In addition to pool size, you can configure a `pool_timeout` setting. This setting defines the amount of time the Prisma Client query engine has to process a query before it throws an exception and moves on to the next query in the queue. The default `pool_timeout` setting is 10 seconds. If you still experience timeouts after increasing `connection_limit` setting, you can try setting the `pool_timeout` parameter to a value larger than the default (10 seconds). For configuration guidance, refer to [Increasing the pool timeout](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#increasing-the-pool-timeout), in the _Prisma documentation_.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=15"
```

</CodeBlock>

You can disable pool timeouts by setting `pool_timeout=0`.

## JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas

If you are working with a large Prisma schema, Prisma recently introduced a `jsonProtocol` wire protocol feature that expresses queries using `JSON` instead of GraphQL. The JSON implementation uses less CPU and memory, which can help reduce latencies when connecting from Prisma.

`jsonProtocol` is the default wire protocol as of Prisma version 5.0.0. If you run Prisma version 5.0.0 or later, you are already using the new protocol. If you run Prisma version 4 or earlier, you must use a feature flag to enable the `jsonProtocol`. You can read more about this feature here: [jsonProtocol changes](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-5/jsonprotocol-changes).

Symfony is a free and open-source PHP web application framework. Symfony uses the Doctrine library for database access. Connecting to Neon from Symfony with Doctrine is the same as connecting to a standalone Postgres installation from Symfony with Doctrine. Only the connection details differ.

To connect to Neon from Symfony with Doctrine:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Configure the connection](#configure-the-connection)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Configure the connection

In your `.env` file, set the `DATABASE_URL` to the Neon project connection string that you copied in the previous step.

```shell
DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?charset=utf8&sslmode=require"
```


You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

To connect to Neon from a Django application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Configure Django connection settings](#configure-django-connection-settings)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Configure Django connection settings

Connecting to Neon requires configuring database connection settings in your Django project's `settings.py` file.

In your Django project, navigate to the `DATABASES` section of your `settings.py` file and modify the connection details as shown:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': '[dbname]',
        'USER': '[user]',
        'PASSWORD': '[password]',
        'HOST': '[hostname]',
        'PORT': '[port]',
         'OPTIONS': {
             'sslmode': 'require',
        }
    }
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon places computes into an `Idle` state and closes connections after 5 minutes of inactivity (see [Compute lifecycle](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle/)). To avoid connection errors, you can set the Django [CONN_MAX_AGE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-CONN_MAX_AGE) setting to 0 to close database connections at the end of each request so that your application does not attempt to reuse connections that were closed by Neon. From Django 4.1, you can use a higher `CONN_MAX_AGE` setting in combination with the [CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#conn-health-checks) setting to enable connection reuse while preventing errors that might occur due to closed connections. For more information about these configuration options, see [Connection management](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/databases#connection-management), in the _Django documentation_.
</Admonition>

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

For additional information about Django project settings, see [Django Settings: Databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings#databases), in the Django documentation.

<Admonition type="note">
Running Django tests is currently not supported. The Django test runner must be able to create a database for tests, which is not yet supported by Neon.
</Admonition>

## Connection issues

Django uses the `psycopg2` driver as the default adapter for Postgres. If you have an older version of that driver, you may encounter a `Endpoint ID is not specified` error when connecting to Neon. This error occurs if the client library used by your driver does not support the Server Name Indication (SNI) mechanism in TLS, which Neon uses to route incoming connections. The `psycopg2` driver uses the `libpq` client library, which supports SNI as of v14. You can check your `psycopg2` and `libpq` versions by starting a Django shell in your Django project and running the following commands:

```bash
# Start a Django shell
python3 manage.py shell

# Check versions
import psycopg2
print("psycopg2 version:", psycopg2.__version__)
print("libpq version:", psycopg2._psycopg.libpq_version())
```

The version number for `libpq` is presented in a different format, for example, version 14.1 will be shown as 140001. If your `libpq` version is less than version 14, you can either upgrade your `psycopg2` driver to get a newer `libpq` version or use one of the workarounds described in our [Connection errors](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified) documentation. Upgrading your `psycopg2` driver may introduce compatibility issues with your Django or Python version, so you should test your application thoroughly.

This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a simple Python application using [Psycopg (psycopg2)](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/), a popular Postgres database adapter for the Python programming language. The application connects to Neon and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

To connect:

1. [Create a Neon Project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Python project](#create-a-python-project)
3. [Store your Neon credentials](#store-your-neon-credentials)
4. [Configure your Python script](#configure-your-python-script)
5. [Test your connection](#test-your-connection)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

The project is created with a ready-to-use `neondb` database, which you will connect to.

## Create a Python project

1. Create a project directory and change to the newly created directory.

   ```shell
   mkdir neon-python-example
   cd neon-python-example
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment in this directory. The virtual environment isolates your project's Python environment (including installed packages) from the rest of your system.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment. When the virtual environment is activated, Python uses the environment's version of Python and any installed packages.

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install `psycopg2` and `python-dotenv` in your project's root directory. You can install them using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
    ```

## Store your Neon credentials

Add a `.env` file to your project's root directory and add your Neon connection string to it. 

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

Your connection string will look something like this:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

</CodeBlock>

## Configure your python script

Add a `neon-connect.py` file to your project's root directory and add the following code. The script connects to your Neon database and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

```python
import os
import psycopg2
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the connection string from the environment variable
connection_string = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')

# Connect to the Postgres database
conn = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute SQL commands to retrieve the current time and version from PostgreSQL
cur.execute('SELECT NOW();')
time = cur.fetchone()[0]

cur.execute('SELECT version();')
version = cur.fetchone()[0]

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()

# Print the results
print('Current time:', time)
print('PostgreSQL version:', version)
```

## Test your connection

Run the `neon-connect.py` script to test your connection.

```shell
python3 neon-connect.py
```

If the connection is successful, the script returns information similar to the following:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
Current time: 2023-05-24 08:53:10.403140+00:00
PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 15.2 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, 64-bit

SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides application developers with the full power and flexibility of SQL. This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from SQLAlchemy.

**Prerequisites:**

To complete the steps in this topic, ensure that you have an SQLAlchemy installation with a Postgres driver. The following instructions use `psycopg2`, the default driver for Postgres in SQLAlchemy. For SQLAlchemy installation instructions, refer to the [SQLAlchemy Installation Guide](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/intro.html#installation). `psycopg2` installation instructions are provided below.

To connect to Neon from SQLAlchemy:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
1. [Install psycopg2](#install-psycopg2)
1. [Create the "hello neon" program](#create-the-hello-neon-program)
1. [Create an SQLAlchemy engine for your Neon project](#create-an-sqlalchemy-engine-for-your-neon-project)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details, including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Install psycopg2

Psycopg2 is a popular python library for running raw Postgres queries.

For most operating systems, the quickest installation method is using the PIP package manager. For example:

```shell
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

For additional information about installing `psycopg2`, refer to the [psycopg2 installation documentation](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html).

## Create the "hello neon" program

```python
import psycopg2

# Optional: tell psycopg2 to cancel the query on Ctrl-C
import psycopg2.extras; psycopg2.extensions.set_wait_callback(psycopg2.extras.wait_select)

# You can set the password to None if it is specified in a ~/.pgpass file
USERNAME = "alex"
PASSWORD = "AbC123dEf"
HOST = "@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech"
PORT = "5432"
PROJECT = "dbname"

conn_str = f"dbname={PROJECT} user={USERNAME} password={PASSWORD} host={HOST} port={PORT} sslmode=require"

conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_str)

with conn.cursor() as cur:
 cur.execute("SELECT 'hello neon';")
 print(cur.fetchall())
```

You can find all of the connection details mentioned above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

<Admonition type="note">
This example was tested with Python 3 and psycopg2 version 2.9.3.
</Admonition>

## Create an SQLAlchemy engine for your Neon project

SQLAlchemy uses engine abstraction to manage database connections and exposes a `create_engine` function as the primary endpoint for engine initialization.

The following example creates an SQLAlchemy engine that points to your Neon branch:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

USERNAME = "alex"
PASSWORD = "AbC123dEf"
HOST = "ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech"
DATABASE = "dbname"

conn_str = f'postgresql://{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}/{DATABASE}?sslmode=require'

engine = create_engine(conn_str)
```

You can find all of the connection details listed above in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

For additional information about connecting from SQLAlchemy, refer to the following topics in the SQLAlchemy documentation:

- [Establishing Connectivity - the Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/engine.html)
- [Connecting to PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#postgresql)

subtitle: Build GraphQL backends in minutes with Exograph and Neon
enableTableOfContents: true

_This guide was contributed by the Exograph team_

[Exograph](https://exograph.dev) is a new approach to building GraphQL backends. With it, you can effortlessly create flexible, secure, high-performing GraphQL backends in minutes. Powered by a Rust-based runtime, Exograph ensures fast startup times, efficient execution, and minimal memory consumption. Exograph comes equipped with a comprehensive set of tools designed to support every stage of the development lifecycle: from initial development to deployment to ongoing maintenance.

Exograph supports Postgres for data persistence, which makes it a great fit to use with Neon.

## Prerequisites

- Exograph CLI. See [Install Exograph](https://exograph.dev/docs/getting-started).
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a backend with Exograph

Let's create a starter project with Exograph. Run the following commands:

```bash
exo new todo
cd todo
```

You can check the code it created by examining the `src/index.exo` file (which has a definition for the `Todo` type). If you would like, you can try the [yolo](https://exograph.dev/docs/cli-reference/development/yolo) mode by trying the `exo yolo` command.

Next, let's set up the Neon database.

## Create the schema in Neon

1. Navigate to the Neon Console, select your project, and copy the connection string, which will look something like this: `postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname`.
2. Create schema in Neon using Exograph CLI:

```bash
exo schema create | psql <the connection string>
```

## Launch the backend

```bash
EXO_POSTGRES_URL=<the connection string> exo dev
```

It will print the necessary information for connecting to the backend.

```raw
Starting server in development mode...
Watching the src directory for changes...

Verifying new model...
Started server on 0.0.0.0:9876 in 717.19 ms
- Playground hosted at:
 http://0.0.0.0:9876/playground
- Endpoint hosted at:
 http://0.0.0.0:9876/graphql
```

That's it! You can now open [http://localhost:9876/playground](http://localhost:9876/playground) in your browser to see the GraphQL Playground.

You can create a todo by running the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createTodo(data: {title: "Set up Exograph with Neon", completed: true}) {
    id
  }
}
```

To get all todos, try the following query:

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

And you should see the todo you just added. Please follow Exograph's [guide to creating a simple application](https://exograph.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-simple-application) for more details.

## Learn more

In this guide, we have created a basic todo backend using Exograph and Neon. You can extend this further by establishing relationships between types, implementing access control rules, and integrating custom business logic. Check out Exograph's [application tutorial](https://exograph.dev/docs/application-tutorial/overview) for more details.

To deploy Exograph in the cloud and connect it to Neon, follow the guide below (select the "External Database" tab for Neon-specific instructions in each case):

1. Deploying on [Fly.io](https://exograph.dev/docs/deployment/cloud-deployment) (these instructions can be adapted to other cloud providers)
2. Deploying on [AWS Lambda](https://exograph.dev/docs/deployment/aws-lambda-deployment)

  Neon
enableTableOfContents: true

_This guide was contributed by Josep Vidal from Grafbase_

Grafbase allows you to combine your data sources into a centralized GraphQL endpoint and deploy a serverless GraphQL backend.

This guide describes how to create a GraphQL API using Grafbase and use Grafbase [Edge Resolvers](https://grafbase.com/docs/edge-gateway/resolvers) with the [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to interact with your Neon database at the edge.

The example project in this guide simulates a marketplace of products, where the product price is dynamically calculated based on data retrieved from your Neon database.

## Prerequisites

- The [Grafbase CLI](https://grafbase.com/cli)
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a backend with Grafbase

1. Create a directory and initialize your Grafbase project by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    npx grafbase init grafbase-neon
    cd grafbase-neon
    ```

2. In your project directory, open the `grafbase/schema.graphql` file and replace the existing content with the following schema:

    ```graphql
    extend type Mutation {
      addProductVisit(productId: ID!): ID! @resolver(name: "add-product-visit")
    }

    type Product @model {
      name: String!
      price: Float @resolver(name: "product/price")
    }
    ```

## Create the schema in Neon

1. Navigate to the Neon Console and select your project.
2. Open the Neon **SQL Editor** and run the following `CREATE TABLE` statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE product_visits(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, product_id TEXT NOT NULL);
    ```

    The `product_visits` table stores product page view data that the application uses to dynamically calculate a product price.

## Create the resolver files

The schema includes an `addProductVisit` query and `prodcut/price` field. Create resolvers for those by creating the following files in your project directory:

- `grafbase/resolvers/add-product-visit.js`
- `grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js`

You can use the following commands to create the files:

```bash
cd grafbase
mkdir resolvers
cd resolvers
touch add-product-visit.js
mkdir product 
cd product
touch price.js
```

You will add code to these files in a later step.

## Install the Neon serverless driver

Inside the `grafbase` directory in your project, run the following commands to install the Neon serverless driver:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  npm init -y
  npm install @neondatabase/serverless
  ```

## Retrieve your Neon connection string

A database connection string is required to forward queries to your Neon database. To retrieve the connection string for your database:

1. Navigate to the Neon **Dashboard**.
2. Copy the connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget. The connection string should appear similar to the following:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

3. Add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your `grafbase/.env` file and set the value to your connection string. For example:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

## Add code to the resolvers

1. In the `resolvers/product/add-product-visit` resolver, add the following code, which inserts a new record in the `product_visits` table with a `productId` each time the resolver is queried.

    ```javascript
    # grafbase/resolvers/add-product-visit.js
    import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

    export default async function Resolver(_, { productId }) {
      const client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

      await client.connect()
      await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO product_visits (product_id) VALUES ('${productId}')`
      )
      await client.end()

      return productId
    }
    ```

2. In the `grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js` resolver, add the following code, which calculates the product price based on the number of product visits (the number of visits represents customer interest in the product).

    ```javascript
    # grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js
    import { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless'

    export default async function Resolver({ id }) {
      const client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
      await client.connect()

      const {
        rows: [{ count }]
      } = await client.query(
        `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_visits WHERE product_id = '${id}'`
      )
      await client.end()

      return Number.parseInt(count)
    }
    ```

## Test the resolvers

To test the resolvers with Neon, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Grafbase CLI:

    ```bash
    npx grafbase dev
    ```

2. Go to http://localhost:4000 and execute the following GraphQL mutation, which creates a new product:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      productCreate(input: { name: "Super Product" }) {
        product {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Use the product `id` to execute the following mutation, which adds a row to the database table in Neon:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      addProductVisit(productId: "PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID")
    }
    ```

4. Query the same product, and check the price:

    ```graphql
    query {
      product(input: { by: "PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID" }) {
        id
        name
        price
      }
    }
    ```

5. Run the query several more times and watch how the price increases as "interest" in the product increases.

- An existing Neon project. If you do not have a Neon project, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
- A connection string for a branch in your Neon project:

  ```text
  postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
  ```

  Your project's connection string can be found on the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

### Add Neon as a data source

The following steps describe how to navigate to Hasura Cloud and connect to your Neon project.

1. Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/projects) and sign up or log in.
1. Click **Create Project** to create a Hasura Cloud project or click **Launch Console** to open an existing project.
1. Select **DATA** from the top navigation bar.
1. On the **Connect Existing Database** tab, paste your connection string into the **Database URL** field.
1. Enter a display name for your database in the **Database Display Name** field, and click **Connect Database**.

Hasura Cloud connects to your Neon project and automatically discovers the default `public` schema.

To start exploring Hasura's GraphQL API with data stored in Neon, see [Load a template in Hasura](#load-a-template-in-hasura-optional).

## Load a template in Hasura (optional)

Optionally, after connecting from your Hasura project to Neon, you can explore Hasura's GraphQL API by loading a template from Hasura's template gallery. Follow these steps to load the `Welcome to Hasura` template, which creates `customer` and `order` tables and populates them with sample data.

1. In the Hasura Console, select **DATA**.
1. Under **Data Manager**, select your database.
1. From the **Template Gallery**, select **Welcome to Hasura** to install the template.

To view the newly created tables from the Neon Console:

1. In the Hasura Console, select **DATA** > **Manage your Neon databases** to open the Neon Console.
2. In the Neon Console, select your project.
3. Select the **Tables** tab. The newly created `customer` and `order` tables should appear under the **Tables** heading in the sidebar.

## Import existing data to Neon

If you are migrating from Hasura with Heroku Postgres to Neon, refer to the [Import data from Heroku](/docs/import/import-from-heroku) guide for data import instructions. For general data import instructions, see [Import data from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).

GraphQL has been around for years and is becoming increasingly popular among web developers. It is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data. GraphQL allows clients to access data flexibly and efficiently. However, building a GraphQL API often requires writing a lot of code and familiarizing yourself with a new framework. This guide shows how you can generate a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes using [StepZen](https://stepzen.com/).

Why use Neon and StepZen together? Neon is serverless Postgres. Neon separates storage and compute to offer modern developer features such as scale-to-zero and database branching. With Neon, you can be up and running with a Postgres database in just a few clicks, and you can easily create and manage your database in the Neon Console and connect to it using [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor) or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). What if you want to let clients consume your data through an API in a way that is both flexible and efficient? That's where StepZen comes in. StepZen is a GraphQL API platform that lets you build a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes. Just like Neon, it's serverless and offers a generous free tier.

## Set up Neon

Before generating a GraphQL API, you must set up a Neon database, which you can do it in a few steps:

1. Sign in to Neon, or [sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up) if you do not yet have an account.
2. Select a Neon project. If you do not have one, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
3. [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) or use the ready-to-use `dbname` database.

You can find the connection string for your database in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

Using the connection string, you can seed the database with the data from the `init.sql` file, which you can find [here](https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples/blob/main/with-neon/init.sql).

Running the `init.sql` file creates the `address`, `customer`, `product`, and `order` tables and populates them with the data. It also creates tables that connect the `customer` table with the `address` table, and the `order` table with the `product` table.

You can seed the database directly from the terminal by running the following `psql` command:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname] < init.sql
```

</CodeBlock>

The command takes a Neon connection string as the first argument and a file as the second argument.

In the terminal, you can see that the tables are created and populated with the data. You can also view the tables and data from the **Tables** page in the Neon Console.

![Neon database seeded with data](/docs/guides/stepzen_tables_view.png)

Next, you will connect StepZen to the Neon database and use it to generate a GraphQL schema for the database.

## Connect StepZen to Neon

To generate a GraphQL schema for the data in your Neon database, you need to connect StepZen to Neon. This can be done manually or by using the StepZen CLI.

The StepZen CLI can be installed with `npm` (or Yarn), and it must be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g stepzen
```

After you install the CLI, create a StepZen account. You can do this by navigating to [https://stepzen.com/](https://stepzen.com) and clicking the **Start for Free** button.

To link your StepZen account to the CLI, log in using the following command:

```bash
stepzen login
```

<Admonition type="note">
You can also use StepZen without creating an account. The difference is that you will have a public account, which means that your schema will be public, and everyone with the link can query data from your database. For more information, refer to the [StepZen documentation](https://stepzen.com/docs/quick-start/install-and-setup).
</Admonition>

Next, create a local directory for your StepZen workspace and navigate to the directory. For example:

```bash
mkdir stpezen
cd stepzen
```

Specify your data source with the `stepzen import` CLI. Answer the setup questions as shown below.

```bash
stepzen import postgresql

? What would you like your endpoint to be called? api/with-neon
? What is your host? YOUR_NEON_HOST:5432 (e.g., `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432`)
? What is your database name? YOUR_NEON_DATABASE (e.g., `dbname`)
? What is the username? YOUR_NEON_USERNAME (e.g., `alex`)
? What is the password? [hidden] YOUR_NEON_PASSWORD
? Automatically link types based on foreign key relationships using @materializer
 (https://stepzen.com/docs/features/linking-types) Yes
? What is your database schema (leave blank to use defaults)?

Starting... done
Successfully imported schema postgresql from StepZen
```

The CLI has now created a GraphQL schema based on the tables and data in your Neon database. You can find the schema in the `stepzen` folder at the root of your project. The schema is generated in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file.

<Admonition type="note">
The **Automatically link types based on foreign key relationships using @materializer** step is essential, as it automatically links the tables based on foreign key relationships, which allows you to query data from the `customer` table and get related data from the `address` table.
</Admonition>

The `config.yaml` file stores connection details for the Neon database. The StepZen CLI uses this file to connect to the Neon database. But you need to make two changes to the file:

```bash
configurationset:
  - configuration:
      name: postgresql_config
      uri: YOUR_NEON_DSN?user=YOUR_NEON_USERNAME&password=YOUR_NEON_PASSWORD&options=project=YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID&sslmode=require
```

As shown above, you need to append `&options=project=YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID` to the `uri` connection string. This is needed to establish a secure connection to the Neon database. The `project` option is the ID of the project in Neon. You can find the project ID in the Neon Console under **Settings** or in the URL of your project.

The next section explores the GraphQL API to see how the connection between the Neon Postgres database and StepZen works.

## Explore the GraphQL API

The GraphQL schema that StepZen generates still needs to be deployed to the cloud before you are able to explore the GraphQL API. With StepZen, you have multiple options to deploy your schema. You can deploy it to the StepZen cloud or run it locally using Docker. This guide uses the StepZen cloud, which the fastest way to get started.

To deploy the schema to the StepZen cloud, run the following command:

```bash
stepzen start
```

After the schema is deployed, you can explore the GraphQL API in the [StepZen dashboard](https://dashboard.stepzen.com/explorer).

From the dashboard, you can view the GraphQL schema, try out queries and mutations, and generate code snippets for your favorite programming language.

The CLI also outputs the URL of your GraphQL API endpoint. You can use this endpoint to query your API from other tools or applications.

It's time to start querying the GraphQL API. Start by querying the `customer` table. You can do this by writing the following query on the left-hand side of the dashboard:

```graphql
{
  getCustomerList {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The GraphQL API will retrieve the `name` and `email` fields from the `customer` table. The result looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getCustomerList": [
      {
        "name": "Lucas Bill",
        "email": "lucas.bill@example.com"
      },
      {
        // ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In GraphQL, the result has the same shape as the query (or other operation) you used to retrieve it. The GraphQL API will only retrieve the fields from the database that are present in the query. The query sent to the Neon database has the following shape:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer
```

The following section dives deeper into the GraphQL API, showing how GraphQL API queries are translated to SQL.

## From GraphQL query to SQL

You have explored the GraphQL API, learning how to query data from the Neon database. But how does this work? How is a GraphQL query translated to an SQL query that runs on your Neon database?

In the previous example, StepZen only requests the fields in the query, improving the GraphQL API's performance. Requesting all fields from the database makes no sense if only a few are requested.

Below, you can see a snippet of the `getCustomerList` query in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file:

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomerList: [Customer]
    @dbquery(
      type: "postgresql"
      schema: "public"
      table: "customer"
      configuration: "postgresql_config"
    )
}
```

The `getCustomerList` query defined in the GraphQL schema returns an array of the type `Customer`.

- The `@dbquery` directive identifies the query as a database query
- `type` defines the type of database
- `schema` defines the schema
- `table` defines the table in the database
- `configuration` defines the name of the connection configuration used to connect to the database

Earlier, the CLI created connections based on foreign key relationships. For example, the `order` table has a foreign key relationship with the `customer` table. This means that you can query data from the `order` table, and get the related data from the `customer` table. You can query the customer linked to an order like this:

```graphql
{
  getOrderList {
    id
    shippingcost
    customer {
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to the `id` and `shippingcost` fields, the `name` and `email` fields are requested from the `customer` table. So how does the query get the `customer` field?

The `getOrderList` query is defined in the GraphQL schema, and returns a list of the type `Order` with a field called `customerid`. This relationship is defined as a foreign key in the database and the GraphQL schema has a field called `customer`, which is linked to the `customerid` field.

```graphql
type Order {
  carrier: String
  createdat: Date!
  customer: Customer
    @materializer(
      query: "getCustomer"
      arguments: [{ name: "id", field: "customerid" }]
    )
  customerid: Int!
  id: Int!
  lineitemList: [Lineitem] @materializer(query: "getLineitemUsingOrderid")
  shippingcost: Float
  trackingid: String
}
```

The `@materializer` directive links the `customer` field to the `customerid` field. The `query` argument is the name of the query that retrieves the data, which in this case is `getCustomer`. The `arguments` argument is an array of objects that define the arguments passed to the query. In this case, the `id` argument is passed to the `getCustomer` query, and the value of the `id` argument is the value of the `customerid` field.

When you retrieve a list of orders from the database, you can include the `customer` field for each order. StepZen then executes the `getCustomer` query with the `id` argument set to the value of the `customerid` field.

```graphql
type Query {
  getCustomer(id: Int!): Customer
    @dbquery(
      type: "postgresql"
      schema: "public"
      table: "customer"
      configuration: "postgresql_config"
    )
}
```

This GraphQL query is translated to the following SQL query, which is run on the Neon Postgres database.

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer WHERE id = $1
```

And together with the previous query, it is translated to the following SQL query for the Neon Postgres database:

```sql
SELECT id, shippingcost, customerid FROM public.order
SELECT name, email FROM public.customer WHERE id = $1
```

StepZen reuses SQL queries or merges queries when possible to retrieve data from the Neon database more efficiently. For example, if you request the `customer` field for multiple orders, StepZen only executes the `getCustomer` query once for every recurring value of `customerid`.

<Admonition type="note">
In addition to having StepZen generate the query that is sent to the Neon database, you can also define a raw query in the GraphQL schema. Defining a raw query is useful when you want to query data from multiple tables or when you want to use a more complex query. You can find an example in the `getOrderUsingCustomerid` query in the `postgresql/index.graphql` file.
</Admonition>

## Conclusion

In this guide, you have learned how to generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database. You have used StepZen, which offers GraphQL-as-a-Service and a CLI to generate GraphQL APIs from data sources such as databases and REST APIs. Using StepZen, you can quickly generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database and use it to query data from the database. You also looked at how StepZen translates queries to the GraphQL API into SQL queries that run on your Neon database.

You can find the complete code example [here](https://github.com/stepzen-dev/examples).

WunderGraph is an open-source Backend for Frontend (BFF) framework designed to optimize developer workflows through API composition. Developers can use this framework to compose multiple APIs into a single unified interface and generate typesafe API clients that include authentication and file uploads. This guide shows how you can pair WunderGraph with your Neon database to accelerate application development.

With WunderGraph, you can easily introspect your data sources and combine them within your virtual graph. WunderGraph treats APIs as dependencies. You can easily turn your Neon database into a GraphQL API or expose it via JSON-RPC or REST. With an easy-to-deploy Postgres database like Neon, you can now have a 100% serverless stack and build your own stateful serverless apps on the edge.

This guide demonstrates setting up a full-stack app with Neon and WunderGraph, securely exposing Neon to your Next.js frontend in under 15 minutes. While WunderGraph and Neon are compatible with a variety of frontend clients, this demo focuses on using Next.js.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A [WunderGraph Cloud](https://cloud.wundergraph.com/) account
- A Neon project. See [Create a Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Installation

Sign into [WunderGraph Cloud](https://cloud.wundergraph.com/) and follow these steps:

1. Click **New Project**.
2. Choose the `NEXT.js` template and give your repository a name.
3. Select the region closest to you.
4. Click **Deploy**.

The deployment will take a few moments.

### Add sample data to Neon

While the project is deploying, add some sample data to your Neon database.

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/) and select **SQL Editor** from the sidebar.
2. Run the following SQL statements to add the sample data.

```sql
create table if not exists Users (
 id serial primary key not null,
 email text not null,
 name text not null,
 unique (email)
);

create table if not exists Messages (
id serial primary key not null,
user_id int not null references Users(id),
message text not null
);

insert into Users (email, name) VALUES ('Jens@wundergraph.com','Jens@WunderGraph');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'Hey, welcome to the WunderGraph!');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'This is WunderGraph!');
insert into Messages (user_id, message) VALUES ((select id from Users where email = 'Jens@wundergraph.com'),'WunderGraph!');

alter table Users add column updatedAt timestamptz not null default now();

alter table Users add column lastLogin timestamptz not null default now();
```

### Connect Neon and Wundergraph

1. Now that your database has some data, navigate back to WunderGraph Cloud.
2. Select the project you just created and navigate to the **Settings** page.
3. Select the **Integrations** tab and click **Connect Neon**.
   ![WunderGraph Settings](/docs/guides/wundergraph_settings.png)
4. You are directed to Neon to authorize WunderGraph. Review the permissions and click **Authorize** to continue.
   You are directed back to WunderGraph Cloud. If you are a part of multiple organizations, you are asked to select the organization to connect with Neon.
5. Select the Neon project and WunderGraph project that you want to connect, and click **Connect Projects**.
   ![WunderGraph connect projects](/docs/guides/wundergraph_connect_projects.png)

Your Neon and Wundergraph projects are now connected.

<Admonition type="important">
WunderGraph creates a role named `wundergraph-$project_id` in the Neon project that you selected during the integration process. Please do not delete or change the password for this role.

WunderGraph configures a environment variable called `NEON_DATABASE_URL`. Please use this variable wherever you need to provide a database URL.
</Admonition>

## Set up the WunderGraph project locally

The following steps describe how to set up your Wundergraph project locally and configure access to Neon.

1. In WunderGraph Cloud, select your project and click **View Git repository** to view your WunderGraph project repository.
2. Clone the repository and open it in your IDE. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/wundergraph.git
cd wundergraph
code .
```

3. After the project is cloned, run the following commands in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```

   These commands install the required dependencies and start your project locally.

4. Inside the `.wundergraph` directory, open the `wundergraph.config.ts` file and add Neon as a datasource, as shown below, or simply replace the existing code with this code:

   ```typescript
   import {
     configureWunderGraphApplication,
     introspect,
     authProviders,
     EnvironmentVariable,
   } from '@wundergraph/sdk';
   import operations from './wundergraph.operations';
   import server from './wundergraph.server';

   const spaceX = introspect.graphql({
     apiNamespace: 'spacex',
     url: 'https://spacex-api.fly.dev/graphql/',
   });

   // Add your neon datasource
   const neon = introspect.postgresql({
     apiNamespace: 'neon',
     //Your database URL can be found in the Neon console
     databaseURL: new EnvironmentVariable('NEON_DATABASE_URL'),
   });

   configureWunderGraphApplication({
     // Add neon inside your APIs array
     apis: [spaceX, neon],
     server,
     operations,
     codeGenerators: [
       {
         templates: [...templates.typescript.all],
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

5. Write an operation that turns your Neon database into an API that exposes data that you can pass through the frontend. To do so, navigate to the `operations` folder inside your `.wundergraph` directory and create a new file called `Users.graphql`.

   <Admonition type="info">
   With WunderGraph you can write operations in either GraphQL or TypeScript.
   </Admonition>

   Inside your `Users.graphql` file, add the following code:

   ```graphql
   {
     neon_findFirstusers {
       id
       name
       email
     }
   }
   ```

This operation queries your Neon database using GraphQL and exposes the data via JSON-RPC. In the next section, you will add the operation to the frontend.

## Configure the frontend

This section describes how to configure the frontend application.

1. In your local project, navigate to the `pages` directory and open the `index.tsx` file.
2. In the `index.tsx` file, make the following three changes or replace the existing code with the code shown below:

- Retrieve the data from the `Users` endpoint using the `UseQuery` hook.
- On line 62, update the copy to read: "This is the result of your **Users** Query".
- On line 66, pass the `users` variable through to the frontend.

```typescript
import { NextPage } from 'next';
import { useQuery, withWunderGraph } from '../components/generated/nextjs';

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const dragons = useQuery({
    operationName: 'Dragons',
  });
  // We want to write this hook to get the data from our Users operation
  const users = useQuery({
    operationName: 'Users',
  });

  const refresh = () => {
    dragons.mutate();
  };

Flyway is a database migration tool that facilitates version control for databases. It allows developers to manage and track changes to the database schema, ensuring that the database evolves consistently across different environments.

This guide steps you through installing the Flyway command-line tool, configuring Flyway to connect to a Neon database, and running database migrations. The guide follows the setup described in the [Flyway command-line quickstart](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/quickstart-command-line-184127576.html).

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A Neon project. See [Create your first project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).
- A database. This guide uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database. You can create your own database if you like. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Download and extract Flyway

1. Download the latest version of the [Flyway command-line tool](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/command-line-184127404.html).

2. Extract the Flyway files. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    tar -xzvf flyway-commandline-x.y.z-linux-x64.tar.gz -C ~/
    ```

3. Open a command prompt to view the contents of your Flyway installation:

    ```bash
    cd ~/flyway-x.y.z
    ls
    assets  drivers  flyway.cmd  jre  licenses    rules
    conf    flyway   jars        lib  README.txt  sql
    ```

## Set your path variable

Add the Flyway directory to your `PATH` so that you can execute Flyway commands from any location.

<CodeTabs labels={["bash", "zsh"]}>

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/flyway-x.y.z' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/flyway-x.y.x' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</CodeTabs>

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve your password and a Java connection string from the **Connection Details** widget.

Your Java connection string should look something like this:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
```

</CodeBlock>

## Configure flyway

To configure Flyway to connect to your Neon database, create a `flyway.conf` file in the /conf directory. Include the following items, modified to use the connection details you retrieved in the previous step.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb

flyway.user=alex

flyway.password=AbC123dEf

flyway.locations=filesystem:/home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql
```

</CodeBlock>

## Create the first migration

Create an `sql` directory to hold your first migration file. We'll name the file `V1__Create_person_table.sql` and include the following command, which creates a person table in your database.

```bash
create table person (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

## Migrate the database

Run the `flyway migrate` command to migrate your database:

```bash
flyway migrate
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:sqlite:FlywayQuickStartCLI.db (SQLite 3.41)
Successfully validated 1 migration (execution time 00:00.008s)
Creating Schema History table: "PUBLIC"."flyway_schema_history"
Current version of schema "PUBLIC": << Empty Schema >>
Migrating schema "PUBLIC" to version 1 - Create person table
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "PUBLIC" (execution time 00:00.033s)
```

To verify that the `person` table was created, you can view it on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## Add a second migration

Run another migration to add data to the table. Add a second migration file to the `/sql` directory called `V2__Add_people.sql` and add the following statements:

```bash
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (1, 'Alex');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (2, 'Mr. Lopez');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (3, 'Ms. Smith');
```

Run the migration:

```bash
flyway migrate
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-red-credit-85617375.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Successfully validated 2 migrations (execution time 00:00.225s)
Current version of schema "public": 1
Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - Add people"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "public", now at version v2 (execution time 00:00.388s)
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql/report.html
```

You can verify that the data was added by viewing the table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## View your schema migration history

When you run the `flyway migrate` command, Flyway registers the schema changes in the `flyway_schema_history` table, which Flyway automatically creates in your database. You can view the table by running the [flyway info](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/command-line-info-184127413.html) command.

```bash
flyway info
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-red-credit-85617375.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Schema version: 2
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
| Category  | Version | Description         | Type | Installed On        | State   | Undoable |
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
| Versioned | 1       | Create person table | SQL  | 2023-10-22 19:00:39 | Success | No       |
| Versioned | 2       | Add people          | SQL  | 2023-10-22 19:04:42 | Success | No       |
+-----------+---------+---------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------+
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql/report.html
```

You can also view the table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

# Manage multiple environments

title: Manage multiple database environments
subtitle: Learn how to manage schemas for multiple database environments with Flyway
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-04T12:15:51.547Z'

With Flyway, you can manage and track changes to your database schema, ensuring that the database evolves consistently across different environments.

When automating releases, there are often multiple environments or a chain of environments that you must deliver changes to in a particular order. Such environments might include _development_, _staging_, and _production_.

In this guide, we'll show you how to use Neon's branching feature to spin up a branch for each environment and how to configure Flyway to manage schema changes across those environments.

## Prerequisites

- A flyway installation. See [Get started with Flyway and Neon](/docs/guides/flyway) for installation instructions.
- A Neon account and project. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A database. This guide uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database on the `main` branch of your Neon project. You can create your own database if you like. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Add a table to your database

Set up a database to work with by adding a table to your `neondb` database on the `main` branch of your Neon project. If you completed [Get started with Flyway and Neon](/docs/guides/flyway), you might already have this `person` table created. We'll consider this your _production_ environment database.

If you still need to create the `person` table, open the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), and run the following statement:

```bash
create table person (
    ID int not null,
    NAME varchar(100) not null
);
```

## Create databases for development and staging

Using Neon's branching feature, create your _development_ and _staging_ databases. When you create a branch in Neon, you are creating a copy-on-write clone of the parent branch that incudes all databases and roles that exist on the parent, and each branch is an isolated Postgres instance with its own compute resources.

Perform these steps twice, once for your _development_ branch and once for your _staging_ branch.

<Tabs labels={["Console", "CLI", "API"]}>

<TabItem>
1. In the Neon Console, select your project.
2. Select **Branches**.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
4. Enter a name for the branch. For example, name the branch for the environment (_development_ or _staging_).
5. Select a parent branch. This should be the branch where you created the `person` table.
6. Leave the other default settings and click **Create Branch**.

  "endpoints": [
    {
      "type": "read_only"
    }
  ]
}
' | jq
```

</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When you are finished, you should have a _development_ branch and a _staging_ branch.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection strings

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve the connection string for each branch (`main`, `development`, and `staging`) from the **Connection Details** widget. Use the **Branch** drop-down menu to select each branch before copying the connection string.

Your connection strings should look something like the ones shown below. Note that the hostname differs for each (the part starting with `ep-` and ending with `aws.neon.tech`). That's because each branch is hosted on its own compute instance.

- **main**

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

- **development**

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-mute-night-47642501.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

- **staging**

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    jdbc:postgresql://ep-shrill-shape-27763949.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

## Configure flyway to connect each environment

To enable Flyway to connect to multiple environments, we'll create a configuration file for each environment and add the environment-specific connection details. When running Flyway, you'll specify the configuration file to be used.

<Admonition type="note">
By default, Flyway loads its configuration from the default `conf/flyway.conf` file. This is true even if you specify another configuration file when running Flyway. You can take advantage of this behavior by defining non-environment specific configuration settings in the default `conf/flyway.conf` file, and placing your environment-specific settings in separate configuration files, as we'll do here.
</Admonition>

1. Switch to your Flyway `/conf` directory and create the following configuration files, one for each environment, by copying the default configuration file. For example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/flyway-x.y.z/conf
    cp flyway.conf env_dev.conf
    cp flyway.conf env_staging.conf
    cp flyway.conf env_prod.conf
    ```

2. In each configuration file, update the following items with the correct connection details for that database environment. The `url` setting will differ for each environment (in `env_prod.conf`, the `url` will point to `main`). In this example, where you are the only user, the `user` and `password` settings should be the same for each of your three database environments.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb

    flyway.user=alex

    flyway.password=AbC123dEf

    flyway.locations=filesystem:/home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/sql

    flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    - The `flyway.locations` setting tells Flyway where to look for your migration files. We'll create them in the `/sql` directory in a later step.
    - The `flyway.baselineOnMigrate=true` setting tells Flyway to perform a baseline action when you run the `migrate` command on a non-empty schema with no Flyway schema history table. The schema will then be initialized with the `baselineVersion` before executing migrations. Only migrations above the `baselineVersion` will then be applied. This is useful for initial Flyway deployments on projects with an existing database. You can disable this setting by commenting it out again or setting it to false after applying your first migration on the database.

## Create a migration

Create a migration file called `V2__Add_people.sql`, add it to your Flyway `/sql` directory, and add the following statements to the file:

```bash
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (1, 'Alex');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (2, 'Mr. Lopez');
insert into person (ID, NAME) values (3, 'Ms. Smith');
```

### Run the migration on each environment

Run the migration on each environment in order by specifying the environment's configuration file in the `flyway migrate` command. You'll start with your `development` environment, then `staging`, and then finally, `production`.

<Tabs labels={["Development", "Staging", "Production"]}>

<TabItem>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers>

```bash
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_dev.conf"
```

</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers>

```bash
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_staging.conf"
```

</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

<TabItem>

<CodeBlock showLineNumbers>

```bash
flyway migrate -configFiles="conf/env_prod.conf"
```

</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

A successful migration command returns output similar to the following:

```bash
Database: jdbc:postgresql://ep-nameless-unit-49929920.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb (PostgreSQL 15.4)
Schema history table "public"."flyway_schema_history" does not exist yet
Successfully validated 1 migration (execution time 00:00.199s)
Creating Schema History table "public"."flyway_schema_history" with baseline ...
Successfully baselined schema with version: 1
Current version of schema "public": 1
Migrating schema "public" to version "2 - Add people"
Successfully applied 1 migration to schema "public", now at version v2 (execution time 00:00.410s)
A Flyway report has been generated here: /home/alex/flyway-x.y.z/report.html
```

After you run the migration commands, your database should be consistent across all three environments. You can verify that the data was added to each database by viewing the branch and table on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar and select your database.

## Conclusion

You've seen how you can instantly create new database environment with Neon's branching feature and how to keep schemas consistent across different environments using Flyway. The steps in this guide were performed manually from the command line but could be easily integrated into your release management pipeline. Neon provides a [CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli) and [API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) for automating various tasks in Neon, such as branch creation, which you can also integrate into your release automation.

## Set your path variable

Add the Liquibase directory to your `PATH` so that you can run Liquibase commands from any location.

<CodeTabs labels={["bashrc", "profile", "zsh"]}>

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/liquibase' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</CodeTabs>

## Verify your installation

Verify that the Liquibase installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
liquibase --version
...
Liquibase Version: x.yy.z
Liquibase Open Source x.yy.z by Liquibase
```

## Prepare a Neon database

For demonstration purposes, create a `blog` database in Neon with two tables, `posts` and `authors`.

1. Open the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
1. Select your project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar and create a database named `blog`. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
1. Using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), add the following tables:

    ```sql
    -- Creating the `authors` table
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(100),
        last_name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        bio TEXT
    );

    -- Creating the `posts` table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id),
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        content TEXT,
        published_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

## Retrieve your Neon database connection string

From the Neon **Dashboard**, retrieve your password and a Java connection string from the **Connection Details** widget. Use the selection drop-down menu.

Your Java connection string should look something like the one shown below.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user=alex&password=AbC123dEf
```

</CodeBlock>

## Connect from Liquibase to your Neon database

1. Create a directory for your Liquibase project. For example:

    ```bash
    mkdir blogdb
    ```

2. Change to your project directory and create a `liquibase.properties` file.

    ```bash
    cd blogdb
    touch liquibase.properties
    ```

3. Open the the `liquibase.properties` file in an editor and add entries for a [liquibase changelog file](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/home.html) and your database `url`. We'll call the changelog file `dbchangelog.xml`. You will use this file to define schema changes. For the `url`, specify the Neon connection string you retrieved previously.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```env
    changeLogFile:dbchangelog.xml  
    url: jdbc:postgresql://ep-floral-poetry-66238369.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user=alex&password=4GfNAqycba8P&sslmode=require
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

## Take a snapshot of your database

In this step, you will run the [generateChangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/inspection/generate-changelog.html) command in your project directory to create a changelog file with the current state of your database. We'll call this file `mydatabase_changelog.xml`.

```bash
liquibase --changeLogFile=mydatabase_changelog.xml generateChangeLog
```

Youâll get a changelog file for your database that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<databaseChangeLog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog" xmlns:ext="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext" xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-ext.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-latest.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-latest.xsd">
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-1">
        <createTable tableName="authors">
            <column autoIncrement="true" name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="authors_pkey"/>
            </column>
            <column name="first_name" type="VARCHAR(100)"/>
            <column name="last_name" type="VARCHAR(100)"/>
            <column name="email" type="VARCHAR(255)">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="bio" type="TEXT"/>
        </createTable>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-2">
        <createTable tableName="posts">
            <column autoIncrement="true" name="post_id" type="INTEGER">

            </column>
            <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER"/>
            <column name="title" type="VARCHAR(255)">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="content" type="TEXT"/>
            <column defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" name="published_date" type="TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE"/>
        </createTable>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-3">
        <addUniqueConstraint columnNames="email" constraintName="authors_email_key" tableName="authors"/>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697969580160-4">
        <addForeignKeyConstraint baseColumnNames="author_id" baseTableName="posts" constraintName="posts_author_id_fkey" deferrable="false" initiallyDeferred="false" onDelete="NO ACTION" onUpdate="NO ACTION" referencedColumnNames="author_id" referencedTableName="authors" validate="true"/>
    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```

## Create a schema change

Now, you can start making database schema changes by creating [changesets](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/changeset.html) and adding them to the database changelog file you defined in your `liquibase.properties` file. A changeset is the basic unit of change in Liquibase.

1. Create the changelog file where you will add your schema changes:

    ```bash
    cd ~/blogdb
    touch dbchangelog.xml
    ```

2. Add the following changeset, which adds a `comments` table to your database. Replace `author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234"` with your auther name and id, which you can retrieve from your changelog file, described in the previous step.

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
    <databaseChangeLog  
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
    xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro"  
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-4.4.xsd
        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-4.5.xsd">
        <changeSet author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234">
            <createTable tableName="comments">
                <column autoIncrement="true" name="comment_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="comments_pkey"/>
                </column>
                <column name="post_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_post_id" referencedTableName="posts" referencedColumnNames="post_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_author_id" referencedTableName="authors" referencedColumnNames="author_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="comment" type="TEXT"/>
                <column name="commented_date" type="TIMESTAMP" defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"/>
            </createTable>
        </changeSet>
    </databaseChangeLog>
    ```

## Deploy your change

Deploy your database schema change by running the [update](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update.html) command:

```bash
liquibase update
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 07:33:53 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
Running Changeset: dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::AlexL

UPDATE SUMMARY
Run:                          1
Previously run:               0
Filtered out:                 0
-------------------------------
Total change sets:            1

Liquibase: Update has been successful. Rows affected: 1
Liquibase command 'update' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

<Admonition type="info">
When you run a changeset for the first time, Liquibase automatically creates two tracking tables in your database:

- [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html): Tracks which changesets have been run.
- [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html): Ensures only one instance of Liquibase runs at a time.

You can verify these tables were created by viewing the `blog` database on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
</Admonition>

## Rollback a change

Try rolling back your last change by running the Liquibase [rollbackCount](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/rollback/rollback-count.html) command:

```bash
liquibase rollbackCount 1
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 07:36:22 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
Rolling Back Changeset: dbchangelog.xml::myIDNumber1234::AlexL
Liquibase command 'rollbackCount' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

You can verify that creation of the `comments` table was rolled back viewing the `blog` database on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.

Liquibase is an open-source database-independent library for tracking, managing, and applying database schema changes. To learn more about Liquibase, refer to the [Liquibase documentation](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html).

This guide shows how to set up a developer workflow using Liquibase with Neon's branching feature. The workflow involves making schema changes to a database on a development branch and applying those changes back to the source database on the main branch of your Neon project.

The instructions in this guide are based on the workflow described in the [Liquibase Developer Workflow](https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/developer-workflow) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. See [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A Neon project. See [Create your first project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).
- Liquibase requires Java. For Liquibase Java requirements, see [Requirements](https://docs.liquibase.com/start/install/liquibase-requirements.html). To check if you have Java installed, run `java --version`, or `java -version` on macOS`. 
- An installation of Liquibase. For instructions, refer to [Get started with Liquibase and Neon](/docs/guides/liquibase).

## Initialize a new Liquibase project

Run the [init project](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/init/project.html) command to initialize a Liquibase project in the specified directory. The project directory is created if it does not exist. Initializing a Liquibase project in this way provides you with a pre-populated Liquibase properties file, which we'll modify in a later step.

```bash
liquibase init project --project-dir ~/blogdb
```

Enter `Y` to accept the defaults.

## Prepare a source database

For demonstration purposes, create a `blog` database in Neon with two tables, `posts` and `authors`.

1. Open the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects).
1. Select your project.
1. Select **Databases** from the sidebar and create a database named `blog`. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
1. Using the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), add the following tables:

    ```sql
    -- Creating the `authors` table
    CREATE TABLE authors (
        author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(100),
        last_name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        bio TEXT
    );

    -- Creating the `posts` table
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id),
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        content TEXT,
        published_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

## Prepare a development database

Now, let's prepare a development database in Neon by creating a development branch, where you can safely make changes to your database schema without affecting the source database on your `main` branch. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of the data in your Neon project, so it will include a copy of the `blog` database with the `authors` and `posts` tables that you just created.

To create a branch:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**. You will see your `main` branch, where you just created your `blog` database and tables.
3. Click **New Branch** to open the branch creation dialog.
4. Enter a name for the branch. Let's call it `dev1`.
5. Leave `main` selected as the parent branch. This is where you created the `blog` database.
6. Leave the remaining default settings. Creating a branch from **Head** creates a branch with the latest data, and a compute endpoint is required to connect to the database on the branch.
8. Click **Create Branch** to create your branch.

## Retrieve your Neon database connection strings

From the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects), select your project and retrieve connection strings for your target and source databases from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**.

<Admonition type="note">
The target database is the database on your `dev1` branch where you will will do your development work. Your source database is where you will apply your schema changes later, once you are satisfied with the changes on your development branch.
</Admonition>

1. Select the `dev1` branch, the `blog` database, and copy the connection string.

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog
    ```

2. Select the `main` branch, the `blog` database, and copy the connection string.

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog
    ```

Be careful not to mix up your connection strings. You'll see that the hostname (the part starting with `-ep` and ending in `neon.tech`) differs. This is because the `dev1` branch is a separate instance of Postgres, hosted on its own compute.

## Update your liquibase.properties file

The `liquibase.properties` file defines the location of the Liquibase changelog file and your target and source databases.

1. From your Liquibase project directory, open the `liquibase.properties` file, which comes pre-populated with example settings.

2. Change the `changeLogFile` setting as shown:

    ```env
    changeLogFile=dbchangelog.xml
    ``````

    The [changelog file](https://docs.liquibase.com/parameters/changelog-file.html) is where you define database schema changes (changesets).

3. Change the target database `url`, `username`, and `password` settings to the correct values for the `blog` database on your `dev1` branch. You can obtain the required details from the connection string you copied previously. You will need to swap out the hostname (`ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`), username, and password for your own.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```env
    liquibase.command.url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-silent-hill-85675036.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog

    liquibase.command.username: alex

    liquibase.command.password: AbC123dEf
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

4. Change the source database settings to the correct values for the `blog` database on your `main` branch. The username and password will be the same as your `dev1` branch, but make sure to use the right hostname. Copy the snippet below and replace the hostname (`ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`), username, and password for your own.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```env
    liquibase.command.referenceUrl: jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog

    liquibase.command.referenceUsername: alex

    liquibase.command.referencePassword: AbC123dEf
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

## Take a snapshot of your target database

Capture the current state of your target database. The following command creates a Liquibase changelog file named `mydatabase_changelog.xml`.

```bash
liquibase --changeLogFile=mydatabase_changelog.xml generateChangeLog
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 09:23:33 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)
Liquibase Version: 4.24.0
Liquibase Open Source 4.24.0 by Liquibase
BEST PRACTICE: The changelog generated by diffChangeLog/generateChangeLog should be inspected for correctness and completeness before being deployed. Some database objects and their dependencies cannot be represented automatically, and they may need to be manually updated before being deployed.
Generated changelog written to mydatabase_changelog.xml
Liquibase command 'generateChangelog' was executed successfully.
```

Check for the `mydatabase_changelog.xml` file in your Liquibase project directory. It should look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<databaseChangeLog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog" xmlns:ext="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext" xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog-ext http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-ext.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-latest.xsd http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-latest.xsd">

        </createTable>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697977416317-3">
        <addUniqueConstraint columnNames="email" constraintName="authors_email_key" tableName="authors"/>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet author="alex (generated)" id="1697977416317-4">
        <addForeignKeyConstraint baseColumnNames="author_id" baseTableName="posts" constraintName="posts_author_id_fkey" deferrable="false" initiallyDeferred="false" onDelete="NO ACTION" onUpdate="NO ACTION" referencedColumnNames="author_id" referencedTableName="authors" validate="true"/>
    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```

## Create a schema change

Now, you can start making database schema changes by creating [changesets](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/changeset.html) and adding them to the changelog file you defined in your `liquibase.properties` file. A changeset is the basic unit of change in Liquibase.

1. Create the changelog file where you will add your schema changes:

    ```bash
    cd ~/blogdb
    touch dbchangelog.xml
    ```

2. Add the following changeset to the `dbchangelog.xml` file, which adds a `comments` table to your database:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
    <databaseChangeLog  
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
    xmlns:pro="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro"  
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-4.4.xsd
        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/pro/liquibase-pro-4.5.xsd">
        <changeSet author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234">
            <createTable tableName="comments">
                <column autoIncrement="true" name="comment_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="comments_pkey"/>
                </column>
                <column name="post_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_post_id" referencedTableName="posts" referencedColumnNames="post_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="author_id" type="INTEGER">
                    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="fk_comments_author_id" referencedTableName="authors" referencedColumnNames="author_id"/>
                </column>
                <column name="comment" type="TEXT"/>
                <column name="commented_date" type="TIMESTAMP" defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"/>
            </createTable>
        </changeSet>
    </databaseChangeLog>
    ```

### Deploy the schema change

Run the [update](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update.html) command to deploy the schema change to your target database (your development database on the `dev1` branch).

```bash
liquibase update
```

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following:

```bash

<Admonition type="info">
When you run a changeset for the first time, Liquibase automatically creates two tracking tables in your database:

- [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html): Tracks which changesets have been run.
- [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html): Ensures only one instance of Liquibase runs at a time.

You can verify these tables were created by viewing the `blog` database on your `dev1` branch on the **Tables** page in the Neon console. Select **Tables** from the sidebar.
</Admonition>

At this point, you can continue to iterate, applying schema changes to your database, until you are satisfied with the modified schema.

### Review schema changes

It is a best practice to review schema changes before saving and applying them to your source database.

You can run the [status](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/change-tracking/status.html) command to see if there are any changesets that haven't been applied to the source database. Notice that the command specifies the hostname of the source database:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
liquibase --url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-rapid-bush-01185324.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog status --verbose
```

</CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

If the command was successful, youâll see output similar to the following indicating that there is one changeset that has not been applied to the source database. This is your `comments` table changeset.

```bash
Starting Liquibase at 12:30:51 (version 4.24.0 #14062 built at 2023-09-28 12:18+0000)

Liquibase command 'status' was executed successfully.
```

</details>

### Check your SQL

Before applying the update, you can run the [updateSQL](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/update/update-sql.html) command to inspect the SQL Liquibase will apply when running the update command:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
liquibase --url=jdbc:postgresql://ep-rapid-bush-01185324.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/blog updateSQL

To ensure that all changes have been applied to the production database, you can rerun the `status`, `updatedSql`, and `diff` commands you ran above. After applying the change, there should be no differences. You can also check your databases in the **Tables** view in the Neon console to verify that the source database now has a `comments` table.

<Admonition type="note">
When you run a changeset for the first time on the source database, you will find that Liquibase automatically creates the [databasechangelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangelog-table.html) and [databasechangeloglock](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/tracking-tables/databasechangeloglock-table.html) tracking tables that were created in your development database. These tracking tables are created on any database where you apply changesets.

# Serverless

# Neon serverless driver

title: Neon serverless driver
enableTableOfContents: true
subtitle: Learn how to connect to Neon from serverless and edge environments over HTTP
  or WebSockets
updatedOn: '2023-10-13T14:08:36.352Z'
---

The [Neon serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP.

You can use the driver as a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), the popular npm `pg` package you may already be familiar with. See [Using node-postgres Pool or Client](#using-node-postgres-pool-or-client).

The driver's low-latency capability is due to [message pipelining and other optimizations](https://neon.tech/blog/quicker-serverless-postgres).

## Install the Neon serverless driver

You can install the driver with your preferred JavaScript package manager. For example:

```shell
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
```

The driver includes TypeScript types (the equivalent of `@types/pg`). No additional installation is required.

## Configure your Neon database connection

You can obtain a connection string for your database from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** and set it as an environment variable. Your Neon connection string will look something like this:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

## How to use the driver over HTTP

To use the Neon serverless driver over HTTP, you must use the driver's `neon` function. You can use raw SQL queries or tools such as [Drizzle-ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/neon), [kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely), [Zapatos](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/), and others for type safety.

<CodeTabs labels={["Node.js", "Drizzle-ORM", "Vercel Edge Function", "Vercel Serverless Function"]}>

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const {rows: [post]} = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =$1', [postId]);
// `post` is now [{ id: 12, title: 'My post', ... }] (or undefined)
```

```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { posts } from './schema';

export default async () => {
  const postId = 12;
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const db = drizzle(sql);
  const [onePost] = await db.select().from(posts).where(eq(posts.id, postId));
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ post: onePost }));
}
```

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export default async (req: Request) => {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const {rows: [post]} = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(post));
}

export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

```ts
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
 
export default async function handler(
  request: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const {rows: [post]} = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1', [postId]);
 
  return res.status(500).send(post);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

<Admonition type="note">
The maximum request size and response size for queries over HTTP is 10 MB. Additionally, there is a 15 second proxy timeout for SQL requests over HTTP. Long running queries that exceed the 15 second threshold are terminated.
</Admonition>

## Experimental connection caching

Connection caching provides server-side connection pooling, so that a new connection does not  have to be set up for each query over HTTP. You can enable it by setting `fetchConnectionCache` to `true` in the `neonConfig` object.

## Using node-postgres Pool or Client

You can use the Neon serverless driver in the same way you would use `node-postgres` with `Pool` and `Client`. Where you usually import `pg`, import `@neondatabase/serverless` instead.

<Admonition type="note">
The `Pool` and `Client` objects must be connected, used, and closed within a single request handler. Don't create the objects outside a request handler; don't create them in one handler and try to reuse them in another; and to avoid exhausting available connections, don't forget to close them.

</CodeTabs>

## When to use the neon function vs Pool or Client

The Neon serverless driver supports the `neon` function for queries over HTTP, and `Pool` and `Client` constructors for querying over WebSockets.

### The neon function

Querying over an HTTP [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) request is faster for single, non-interactive transactions. If you do not require sessions or transactions, consider using HTTP for faster response times.

### neon function configuration options

The `neon(...)` function supports `arrayMode`, `fullResults`, and `fetchOptions` option keys for customizing the query function. For usage information, see [Options and configuration](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#options-and-configuration).

The `neon(...)` function also supports issuing multiple queries at once in a single, non-interactive transaction using the `transaction()` function, which is exposed as a property of the query function. For example:

```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
const showLatestN = 10;

const [posts, tags] = await sql.transaction([
  sql`SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT ${showLatestN}`,
  sql`SELECT * FROM tags`,
]);
```

The `transaction()` function supports the same option keys as the ordinary query function â `arrayMode`, `fullResults`, and `fetchOptions` â plus three additional keys concerning transaction configuration:

- `isolationMode`

  Must be one of `ReadUncommitted`, `ReadCommitted`, `RepeatableRead`, or `Serializable`.

- `readOnly`
  
  Ensures that a `READ ONLY` transaction is used to execute queries. This is a boolean option. The default value is `false`.

- `deferrable`

  Ensures that a `DEFERRABLE` transaction is used to execute queries. This is a boolean option. The default value is `false`.

For additional details, see [transaction(...) function](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#transaction-function).

### Pool or Client

The `Pool` and `Client` constructors, which support querying over WebSockets, provide session and transaction support, as well as `node-postgres` compatibility. You can find the API guide for the `Pool` and `Client` constructors in the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) documentation.

Consider using the driver with `Pool` or `Client` in the following scenarios:

- You already use `node-postgres` in your code base and would like to migrate to using `@neondatabase/serverless`.
- You are writing a new code base and want to use a package that expects a `node-postgres-compatible` driver.
- Your backend service uses sessions / interactive transactions with multiple queries per connection.

### Pool and Client configuration options

For configuration options that apply to `Pool` and `Client`, see [options and configuration](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#options-and-configuration) in the driver's GitHub repository.

## Example applications

Explore the example applications that use the Neon serverless driver.

### UNESCO World Heritage sites app

Neon provides an example application to help you get started with the Neon serverless driver. The application generates a `JSON` listing of the 10 nearest UNESCO World Heritage sites using IP geolocation (data copyright Â© 1992 â 2022 UNESCO/World Heritage Centre).

title: Connect from AWS Lambda
subtitle: Learn how to set up a Neon database and connect from an AWS Lambda function
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T10:43:33.372Z'
---

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a convenient and cost-effective solution for running various types of workloads, including those that require a database.

This guide describes how to set up a Neon database and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. It covers:

- Creating a Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), which is a serverless application lifecycle management framework.
- Connecting your Lambda function to a Neon database.
- Deploying the Lambda function to AWS.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account. If you do not have one, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up/) for instructions.
- An AWS account. You can create a free AWS account at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). An [IAM User and Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) are required to programmatically interact with your AWS account. You must provide these credentials when deploying the Serverless Framework project.
- A Service Framework account. You can sign up at [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

## Create a table in Neon

To create a table, navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/):

In the SQL Editor, run the following queries to create a `users` table and insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES
    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
    ('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com'),
    ('Dave', 'dave@example.com'),
    ('Eve', 'eve@example.com');
```

## Create a Lambda function

Create the Lambda function using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/):

1. Install the Serverless Framework by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g serverless
    ```

2. Create a `my-lambda` project directory and navigate to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir neon-lambda
    cd neon-lambda
    ```

3. Run the **serverless** command to create a serverless project.

    ```bash
     serverless
    ```

    Follow the prompts, as demonstrated below. You will be required to provide your AWS account credentials. The process creates an `aws-node-project` directory.

    ```bash
    ? What do you want to make? AWS - Node.js - Starter
    ? What do you want to call this project? aws-node-project

    â Project successfully created in aws-node-project folder

    ? Do you want to login/register to Serverless Dashboard? Yes
    Logging into the Serverless Dashboard via the browser
    If your browser does not open automatically, please open this URL:
    https://app.serverless.com?client=cli&transactionId=jP-Zz5A9xu67PPYqzIhOe

    â You are now logged into the Serverless Dashboard

    ? What application do you want to add this to? [create a new app]
    ? What do you want to name this application? aws-node-project

    â Your project is ready to be deployed to Serverless Dashboard (org: "myorg", app: "aws-node-project")

    ? No AWS credentials found, what credentials do you want to use? AWS Access Role
    (most secure)

    If your browser does not open automatically, please open this URL: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/settings/providers?source=cli&providerId=new&provider=aws

    To learn more about providers, visit: http://slss.io/add-providers-dashboard
    ? 
    [If you encountered an issue when setting up a provider, you may press Enter to
    skip this step]

    â AWS Access Role provider was successfully created

    ? Do you want to deploy now? Yes

    Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1, "default" provider)

    â Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (71s)

    dashboard: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/apps/my-aws-node-project/aws-node-project/dev/us-east-1

    functions:
      hello: aws-node-project-dev-hello (225 kB)

    What next?
    Run these commands in the project directory:

    serverless deploy    Deploy changes
    serverless info      View deployed endpoints and resources
    serverless invoke    Invoke deployed functions
    serverless --help    Discover more commands
    ```

4. Navigate to the `aws-node-project` directory created by the previous step and install the `node-postgres` package, which you will use to connect to the database.

    ```bash
    npm install pg
    ```

    After installing the `node-postgres` package, the following dependency should be defined in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
     "dependencies": {
       "pg": "^8.8.0"
     }
    }
    ```

5. In the `aws-node-project` directory, add a `users.js` file, and add the following code to it:

    ```javascript
    'use strict';

    const { Client } = require('pg');

    module.exports.getAllUsers = async () => {
     var client = new Client(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
     client.connect();
     var { rows } = await client.query('SELECT * from users');
     return {
       statusCode: 200,
       body: JSON.stringify({
         data: rows,
       }),
     };
    };
    ```

    The code in the `users.js` file exports the `getAllUsers` function, which retrieves all rows from the `users` table and returns them as a `JSON` object in the `HTTP` response body.

    This function uses the `pg` library to connect to the Neon database. It creates a new `Client` instance and passes the database connection string, which is defined in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. It then calls `connect()` to establish a connection to the database. Finally, it uses the `query()` method to execute a `SELECT` statement that retrieves all rows from the `users` table.

    The query method returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object containing the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` statement, which the function parses to retrieve the `rows` property. Finally, the function returns an `HTTP` response with a status code of 200 and a body that contains a `JSON` object with a single `data` property, which is set to the value of the rows variable.

6. Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and the function definition to the `serverless.yml` file, which is located in your `aws-node-project` directory.

    <Admonition type="note">
    Environment variables can also be added to a `.env` file and loaded automatically with the help of the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. For more information, see [Resolution of environment variables](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/environment-variables).
    </Admonition>

    You can copy the connection string from **Connection Details** widget the Neon Console. Add the `DATABASE_URL` under `environment`, and add `sslmode=require` to the end of the connection string to enable SSL. The `sslmode=require` option tells Postgres to use SSL encryption and verify the server's certificate.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>
  
    ```yaml
    provider:
     name: aws
     runtime: nodejs14.x
     environment:
       DATABASE_URL: postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require

    functions:
     getAllUsers:
       handler: users.getAllUsers
       events:
         - httpApi:
             path: /users
             method: get
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

7. Deploy the serverless function using the following command:

    ```bash
    serverless deploy
    ```

    The `serverless deploy` command generates an API endpoint using [API Gateway](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api). The output of the command appears similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Deploying aws-node-project to stage dev (us-east-1, "default" provider)

    â Service deployed to stack aws-node-project-dev (60s)

    dashboard: https://app.serverless.com/myorg/apps/aws-node-project/aws-node-project/dev/us-east-1

    endpoint: GET - https://ge3onb0klj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users

    functions:

      getAllUsers: aws-node-project-dev-getAllUsers (225 kB)
    ```
  
8. Test the generated endpoint by running a cURL command. For example:

    ```bash
    curl https://eg3onb0jkl.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/users | jq
    ```

    The response returns the following data:

    ```bash
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "email": "alice@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "email": "bob@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "email": "charlie@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Dave",
          "email": "dave@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "name": "Eve",
          "email": "eve@example.com",
          "created_at": "2023-01-10T17:46:29.353Z"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Enabling CORS

If you make API calls to the Lambda function from your app, you will likely need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  Visit the AWS documentation for information about [how to enable CORS in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-cors.html).

You can run the following command to enable CORS to your local development environment:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id <api-id> --cors-configuration AllowOrigins="http://localhost:3000"
```

</CodeBlock>

You can find your `api-id` on the API Gateway dashboard:

## Conclusion

In this guide, you have learned how to set up a Postgres database using Neon and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. You have also learned how to use Serverless Framework to create and deploy the Lambda function, and how to use the `pg` library to perform a basic database read operations.


# Caching

# PolyScale integration

subtitle: Set up a global database cache with Neon's PolyScale integration
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-04T18:49:23.387Z'
---

[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) allows you to easily cache your data globally through its low-latency [regional edge network](https://docs.polyscale.ai/edge-network-and-security/#regional-edge-network). Enjoy benefits like speedy accces to your data from anywhere in the world, reduced load on your database, and improved slow query performance. A PolyScale global cache is also an alternative to cross-regional replication without the added complexity. No coding or infrastructure changes are required to use PolyScale. You can have it up and running in just a few minutes.

Adding the PolyScale integration to a Neon project automatically creates a global cache and provides you with a PolyScale connection string, which you can use in your application as a direct replacement for your Neon connection string.

By default, PolyScale automatically caches all queries that pass through its platform. This means that when you connect through PolyScale, any queries you run will be automatically cached. Requests are routed to the closest Point Of Presence (POP) location where your query results are  cached for low latency access.

<Admonition type="note">
The PolyScale integration creates a cache for the read-write compute endpoint associated with the [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch) of your Neon project. It does not cache queries for read-only compute endpoints ([read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas)) or [non-primary branches](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch). If you want to set up a cache for those, please refer to the [manual PolyScale setup instructions](/docs/guides/polyscale).
</Admonition>

For more information about PolyScale, see [How PolyScale works](#how-polyscale-works).

To get started with the Neon PolyScale integration, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon account and project. For instructions, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).
- A database on the primary branch of your Neon project. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).

## Add the PolyScale integration

To add the PolyScale integration to your Neon project:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page for your project.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Add** to open the **Add PolyScale** drawer.
    ![Integrations page showing PolyScale](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_add_integration.png)
3. Under **How to add**, click **Sign in**, and sign in to PolyScale using your Google, GitHub, or email account. If you do not have a PolyScale account, you can create one. PolyScale offers a free plan and no credit card is required.
    ![PolyScale sign in](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_sign_in.png)
4. Select the desired PolyScale **Workspace** and click **Authorize Access** to allow Neon to access read and write caches on PolyScale.
    ![PolyScale authorize access](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_authorize.png)

    After the integration is added, you are returned to the **Integrations** page. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** if the **Manage PolyScale** drawer is not already opened. 

    ![PolyScale manage drawer](/docs/guides/polyscale_int_manage.png)

    Here, you can view information about your newly created PolyScale cache and copy the PolyScale connection string. Use this connection string in place of your Neon connection string in your application.

    You might notice the drop-down menus for **Database** and **Role**. If you have multiple databases and roles on the primary branch of your Neon project, use the drop-down menus to select the database and role you want to connect with. Your selections will be reflected in the PolyScale connection string.
   
    <Admonition type="note">
    To ensure your cache remains current, always use the PolyScale connection string. Modifying your database directly through a Neon connection string or the Neon SQL Editor can result in an outdated cache.
    </Admonition>

## View your PolyScale cache

You can access your PolyScale cache directly from the Neon PolyScale integration.

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click the **View cache in PolyScale** link. You directed to PolyScale where you will be required to log in if not logged in already.

## Purging your PolyScale cache

Occasionally, it may be necessary to purge your PolyScale cache. For example, you may want to purge your cache after modifying your data directly without using the PolyScale connection string, which can result in an outdated cache.

To purge your PolyScale cache:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click **Purge PolyScale cache**.

Purging the cache purges all cached data globally.

## Remove the PolyScale integration

To remove the PolyScale integration:

1. In the Neon Console, navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Locate the PolyScale integration and click **Manage** to open the **Manage PolyScale** drawer.
3. Click **Remove integration**.

Removing the integration deletes the cache and terminates all current connections using the PolyScale connection string.

## How PolyScale works

When you use a PolyScale connection string in your application, PolyScale automatically caches the queries that pass through its platform via the connection string. That means any queries you run using the PolyScale connection string are cached, by default.

PolyScale identifies caching opportunities by recognizing and remembering patterns in query traffic. New queries typically begin to see cache hits on or about the third query. For more information on this topic, see [Time To First Hit](https://docs.polyscale.ai/how-does-it-work/#time-to-first-hit-ttfh), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

After queries from your application start passing through PolyScale, you can monitor traffic and caching behavior on the **Observability** tab in PolyScale. For instructions, see [Observability](https://docs.polyscale.ai/database-observability/), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

For additional information about the PolyScale platform, please refer to the [PolyScale documentation](https://docs.polyscale.ai/).

[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) is a serverless database cache service. With PolyScale, you can distribute and cache your data globally, allowing you to scale your database without altering transactional semantics. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. You can connect Neon to PolyScale in minutes, providing your database-backed applications with speedy access to your Neon data from anywhere in the world. 

<Admonition type="note">
Neon also provides a [PolyScale integration](/docs/guides/polyscale-integration), which allows you to set up a PolyScale cache in just a few clicks. The PolyScale integration creates a cache for the read-write compute endpoint associated with your project's [primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch). If you do not want to use the integration or you want to set up a cache for a read-only compute endpoint ([read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas)) or a [non-primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch), use these manual setup instructions.
</Admonition>

Follow the steps below to connect your Neon database to PolyScale manually.

## Retrieve your Neon connection details

In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

Copy the hostname. In the example above, the hostname is this part of the connection string:

```text
 ep-raspy-cherry-95040071.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
 ```

Also, make note of the user, password, and database name. You will need those details when you configure a connection from your  application to PolyScale.

## Create a PolyScale cache

A PolyScale account can have one or more caches. A cache identifies a database by the hostname and port number. Typically, you create one cache per database.

To create the database cache:

1. Log into [PolyScale](https://app.polyscale.ai/signup/). If you do not have an account, you can create one by logging in with your GitHub or Google account. PolyScale has a free tier and does not require a credit card to sign up.
2. If you have just signed up for PolyScale, select **Create new cache** from the **Welcome to PolyScale** dialog.
![Connection details widget](/docs/guides/welcome_to_polyscale.png)
If you already have a PolyScale account, click the **New Cache** button in the upper right corner of the PolyScale dashboard.
3. Enter a name for the cache, select `PostgreSQL` as the type, enter the Neon hostname you copied earlier, and enter the database port number. Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`. Leave the default values for the other settings. The **Caching** setting enables the database query cache, so this setting should remain enabled.
![Create a PolyScale cache](/docs/guides/polyscale_create_cache.png)
4. Click **Create**. PolyScale creates a cache for your Neon database and provides a new **Connection URI** to use in your application in place of the Neon connection string. Simply replace `[USERNAME]`, `[PASSWORD]`, and `[DATABASE]` with the values from your Neon connection string.
![Create a PolyScale cache](/docs/guides/polyscale_success.png)

After queries from your application start passing through PolyScale, you can monitor traffic and caching behavior on the **Observability** tab in PolyScale. For more information, see [Observability](https://docs.polyscale.ai/database-observability/), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

By default, PolyScale automatically caches all queries that pass through the platform. That means you can connect to PolyScale, and any queries you run will be cached.

PolyScale identifies caching opportunities by recognizing and remembering patterns in query traffic. New queries typically begin to see cache hits on or about the third query. For more information, see [Time To First Hit](https://docs.polyscale.ai/how-does-it-work/#time-to-first-hit-ttfh), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

title: Use Neon with Koyeb
subtitle: Learn how to connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with
  Koyeb
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T10:43:33.385Z'
---

[Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) is a developer-friendly, serverless platform designed to easily deploy reliable and scalable applications globally. Koyeb offers native autoscaling, automatic HTTPS (SSL), auto-healing, and global load-balancing across their edge network with zero configuration.

This guide describes how connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with Koyeb. To follow the instructions in this guide, you require:

- A [Koyeb account](https://app.koyeb.com/) to deploy the application. Alternatively, you can install the [Koyeb CLI](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/quickstart/koyeb-cli) if you prefer to deploy the application from your terminal.
- A Neon account to deploy the Postgres database. If you do not have one, see [Sign up](/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up).

The example application connects to your Neon Postgres database using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM. Prisma synchronizes the database schema with the Prisma schema included with the application and seeds the database.

## Create a Neon project

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).
1. Select **Create a project**.
1. Enter a name for the project (`neon-koyeb`, for example), and select a Postgres version and region.
1. Click **Create project**.

A dialog pops up with your Neon connection string, which appears similar to the following:

```bash
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

Store this value in a safe place. It is required later. The connection string specifies `neondb` as the database. This is the ready-to-use database created with each Neon project. You will use this database with the example application.

## Deploy the application on Koyeb

You can deploy on Koyeb using the control panel or the Koyeb CLI.

### From the Koyeb control panel

To deploy the application from the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), follow these steps:

1. Select **Create App**.
1. Select GitHub as the deployment method.
1. Enter `https://github.com/koyeb/example-express-prisma` in the **Public GitHub repository** field.
1. Keep `example-express-prisma` as the name and `main` as the branch.
1. In **Build and deployment settings**, enable the **Override** setting and add the following **Build command**: `npm run postgres:init`
1. Select the region closest to your Neon database.
1. Under **Advanced** > **Environment variables**, add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to enable the application to connect to your Neon Postgres database. Set the value to the Neon connection string provided to you when you created the Neon project.
1. Enter a name for your app. For example, `express-neon`
1. Click **Deploy**.

Koyeb builds the application. After the build and deployment have finished, you can access your application running on Koyeb by clicking the URL ending with `.koyeb.app`.

The example application exposes a `/planets` endpoint that you can use to list planets from the database. After your deployment is live, you should see the following results when navigating to `https://<YOUR_APP_URL>.koyeb.app/planets`:

```json
[
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mercury"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Venus"
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mars"
}
]
```

### From the Koyeb CLI

The [Koyeb CLI](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/quickstart/koyeb-cli) requires an API access token, which you can generate in the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), under **Account** > **API**.

To deploy the example application using the Koyeb CLI, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
koyeb app init express-neon \
--git github.com/koyeb/example-express-prisma \
--git-branch main \
--git-build-command "npm run postgres:init" \
--ports 8080:http \
--routes /:8080 \
--env PORT=8080 \
--env DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]"
```

Make sure to replace `[user]`, `[password]`, and `[host]` with your Neon connection string values.

### Access Koyeb deployment logs

To track the app deployment and visualize build logs, execute the following command:

```bash
koyeb service logs express-neon/express-neon -t build
```

### Access your app

After the build and deployment have finished, you can retrieve the public domain to access your application by running the following command:

```bash
$ koyeb app get express-neon
ID          NAME         STATUS         DOMAINS                                CREATED AT          
b8611a1d    express-neon HEALTHY        ["express-neon-myorg.koyeb.app"]       16 Feb 23 18:13 UTC
```

The example application exposes a `/planets` endpoint that you can use to list planets from the database. After your deployment is live, you should see the following results when navigating to `https://<YOUR_APP_URL>.koyeb.app/planets`:

```json
[
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mercury"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Venus"
},
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Mars"
}
]
```

## Delete the example application and Neon project

To delete the example application on Koyeb to avoid incurring any charges, follow these steps:

1. From the Koyeb [control panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), select the **App** to delete.
1. On the **Settings** tab, select **Danger Zone** and click **Delete**.

To delete your Neon project, refer to [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project).

Neon supports several options for integrating with Vercel:

- [Vercel Postgres](/docs/guides/vercel-postgres)
  
  Vercel Postgres is serverless Postgres **powered by Neon**. This integration allows you to seamlessly create and manage a serverless Postgres instance from the Vercel dashboard. A Neon account is not required.
- [The Neon Vercel Integration](/docs/guides/vercel)
  
  You can find the Neon Vercel Integration on the [Vercel Integration Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon). The integration connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and uses Neon's branching capability to create a database branch for each preview deployment.
- [The Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver)
  
  The Neon serverless driver allows you to query data from [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) and is a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), the popular npm `pg` package.  
- [Connect Vercel and Neon manually](/docs/guides/vercel-manual)
  
  This method involves setting Vercel environment variables to connect your Vercel Project to your Neon database.

[Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) is a collection of managed storage products that you can integrate with your frontend framework. Included in this suite of products is [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), which is serverless Postgres **powered by Neon**.

<YoutubeIframe embedId="gA8cHj3w5XI?start=122" />

Vercel Postgres is currently available in [Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/release-phases#beta) on Vercel's [Pro and Hobby plans](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/payments-and-billing/pro).

With _Vercel Postgres_, creating, deleting, and managing a Postgres instance happens in the Vercel dashboard rather than the Neon Console or using the Neon API. Furthermore, you do not need a Neon account to use Vercel Postgres. Everything is managed from Vercel.

Vercel Postgres is an alternative to using Neon directly through one of the other Vercel integration options described in the [Neon and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).

Use the following resources to get started with Vercel Postgres:

- Read [Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) for an overview of Vercel's storage suite and a brief introduction to Vercel Postgres.
- Read [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) for a full introduction. Here, you can learn about Vercel Postgres uses cases, how to get started with a preconfigured template, ORM compatibility, how Vercel Postgres works, and how to use it in your workflows.
- Follow the [Vercel Postgres Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart) to learn how to read and write data from Vercel Postgres. This guide demonstrates how to create and manage a Neon-powered Postgres database through the Vercel dashboard and populate your database using the Vercel Postgres SDK.
- Explore the [API reference for the Vercel Postgres SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/sdk). The `@vercel/postgres` SDK provides an efficient way to interact with your Postgres database. It is 100% compatible with the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) library.
- Deploy one of the [Vercel Postgres starter templates](https://vercel.com/templates?database=vercel-postgres) to start reading and writing data in minutes.
- Read [Vercel Postgres Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/limits) to learn about Vercel Postgres technical limits.

## About the Neon Vercel Integration

Vercel [preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments) enable teams to collaborate effectively by automatically creating an isolated, production-like environment for every commit. This allows changes to be previewed before they are merged into production.

However, when databases are involved, teams often use a single database containing dummy data for all preview deployments. This setup is not ideal for these reasons:

- If the shared database encounters an issue, so will all preview deployments.
- Changes to the shared database schema might break all previously created preview deployments, making it a productivity bottleneck.

![Shared database](/docs/guides/vercel_shared_database.webp)

Neonâs branching feature addresses these challenges. A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data, so creating it only takes a few seconds. This makes it a scalable and cost-effective solution for preview deployments, enabling you to create a branch for each pull request.

![Branch database](/docs/guides/vercel_branch_database.webp)

When you push changes to the GitHub repository associated with your Vercel project, triggering a preview deployment, the integration automatically creates a branch in Neon and connects it to your preview deployment by setting Vercel preview environment variables.

## Add the Neon Vercel Integration

This section describes how to add the Neon Vercel Integration to your Vercel project.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Please be aware that the Neon Vercel Integration connects one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project, nor does it support connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project.
- The Neon Vercel Integration is currently only supported with the GitHub source code repository.
</Admonition>

Prerequisites:

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A Vercel project. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.
- The integration sets the `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPASSWORD`, and `DATABASE_URL` environment variables for your Vercel production, development, and preview environments. Make sure these variables do not already exist in your Vercel project settings. For more information, see [Troubleshoot connection issues](#troubleshoot-connection-issues).

To add the integration:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Vercel Integration page](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon), and click **Add integration**.
   ![Add integration](/docs/guides/vercel_add_integration.png)
1. Select a **Vercel Account** to add the integration to.
1. Select the Vercel projects to add the integration to. You can select **All Projects** or **Specific Projects** but be aware that you can only connect one Vercel project to one Neon project and vice versa. By selecting **All projects**, you are simply making the integration available to use with all of your Vercel projects.
1. Review the permissions required by the integration, and click **Add Integration**.
1. In the **Integrate Neon** dialog:
    1. Select a Vercel project.
      ![Select a Vercel project](/docs/guides/vercel_select_project.png)
    1. Select the Neon project that you want to connect to your Vercel project by selecting the Neon project, database, and role that Vercel will use to connect.
      ![Connect to Neon](/docs/guides/vercel_connect_neon.png)

          The root branch of your Neon project is preselected as your **Production branch**.

          The **Create a branch for your development environment** option creates a branch named `vercel-dev` and sets Vercel development environment variables for it. The `vercel-dev` branch is a clone of your production branch that you can modify without affecting your production branch.

          When you finish making selections, click **Continue**.
    1. Confirm the integration settings. This allows the integration to:
         - Set environment variables for your Vercel project's production, development, and preview environments.
         - Create database branches for preview deployments.
         - Create a development branch for your Vercel development environment.
      ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_confirm_settings.png)
    1. Click **Connect** to confirm and proceed with the integration. If you encounter a connection error, see [Troubleshoot connection issues](#troubleshoot-connection-issues).

        After the settings are configured, you are presented with a **Success!** dialog.
        ![Vercel integration success](/docs/guides/vercel_success.png)
    1. Click **Done** to complete the installation.
1. To view the results of the integration in Neon:
    1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/).
    1. Select the project you connected to.
    1. Select **Branches**.
       You will see the root branch of your project. If you created a development branch, you will also see a `vercel-dev` branch.
       ![Neon branches](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_branches.png)
1. To view the results of the integration in Vercel:
    1. Navigate to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    1. Select the Vercel project you added the integration to.
    1. Select **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
       You should see the `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPASSWORD`, and `DATABASE_URL` variable settings added by the integration.
       ![Vercel environment variables](/docs/guides/vercel_env_variables.png)

## Use the Neon Vercel Integration

After you add the Neon Vercel Integration to a Vercel project, Neon creates a database branch for each preview deployment. The branch is created when you push commits made on your local branch to your application's GitHub repository. To see the integration in action, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch in your local GitHub repository.

   ```bash
   cd myapp
   git checkout -b myapp-update
   ```

2. Make changes to your application on the local branch.
3. Commit the changes. For example:

   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "Update my app"
   ```

4. Push your commit to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   Pushing the commit triggers the following actions:

   - The commit triggers a preview deployment in Vercel, as would occur without the Neon integration.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_deployments.png)
   - The integration creates a database branch in Neon. This branch is an isolated copy-on-write clone of your production branch, with its own dedicated compute endpoint. The branch is created with the same name as your `git` branch.
     ![Neon preview deployment branch](/docs/guides/vercel_neon_app_update.png)
   - The integration sets Vercel preview environment variables to connect the preview deployment to the new database branch.
     ![Vercel preview settings](/docs/guides/vercel_preview_settings.png)

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon Free Tier lets you create up to 10 branches. To avoid running out of branches for new preview deployments, remove old branches regularly. See [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch) for instructions.
</Admonition>

## Make the integration available to other Vercel projects

If you added the Neon Vercel Integration to a single Vercel project but would like to make it available for use with your other Vercel projects, complete the steps outlined below.

<Admonition type="important">
Please be aware that the Neon Vercel Integration connects one Vercel project to one Neon project. It does not support connecting multiple Vercel projects to one Neon project, nor does it support connecting multiple Neon projects to one Vercel project. The steps below outline how to make the integration available to other Vercel projects to use with their own separate and dedicated Neon project.
</Admonition>

1. Make sure the Neon Vercel Integration that you added previously has access to the Vercel project that you want to use with the Neon Vercel Integration.
   1. On the Vercel Dashboard, select **Integrations**.
   1. Find the Neon Postgres integration, and select **Manage**.
   1. On the Neon Postgres integration page, select **Manage Access**.
   1. On the **Manage Access for Neon Postgres** modal, make sure that the Neon Postgres integration has access to the Vercel project. You can do so by selecting **Specific Projects** and choosing a Vercel project, or by granting access to **All Projects**. If you previously granted access to **All Projects**, no change is necessary.
   1. Click **Save**.
1. Navigate to this URL: [https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new](https://vercel.com/integrations/neon/new).
1. Follow the prompts. When you reach the **Integrate Neon** dialog, select the Vercel project that you want to add the integration to. Vercel projects that are already integrated with Neon are identified as `CONNECTED`, so you'll have to select a different Vercel project.
   ![Confirm integration settings](/docs/guides/vercel_add_new_project.png)
1. Continue following the prompts to complete the setup. These are the same steps described above, in [Add the Neon integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration). When you select a Neon project to connect to, be sure to select one that is not already connected to a Vercel project, as you cannot connect one Vercel project to multiple Neon projects or vice versa. 

## Troubleshoot connection issues

This section describes commonly encountered connection issues for the Neon Vercel Integration.

### Failed to set environment variables

If the environment variables configured by the Neon integration already exist, you may encounter the following error due to an existing integration that sets one or more of the same environment variables.

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```text
Failed to set environment variables in Vercel. Please make sure that the following environment variables are not set: PGHOST, PGUSER, PGDATABASE, PGPASSWORD, DATABASE_URL
```

</CodeBlock>

In this case, you can remove or rename the existing environment variables in your Vercel project settings and retry the Neon integration.

1. From the Vercel project page, select **Settings**.
2. Locate the environment variables required by the Neon integration and remove or rename them.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Alternatively, you can remove the conflicting integration, assuming it is no longer required. This may be a previous Neon integration or another integration. Removing the integration removes the variables set by the integration.
   </Admonition>

3. Try adding the Neon integration again. See [Add the Neon Vercel Integration](#add-the-neon-vercel-integration).

### DATABASE_URL not set on first preview deployment

In Vercel, the preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is not set by the Neon Vercel Integration on the first preview deployment for a pull request.

This is a known [issue](https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/issues/5378) with a dependency on Vercel that we are working to resolve.

The current workaround is to redeploy your preview deployment in Vercel. The preview environment `DATABASE_URL` is set on the next deployment. For redeploy instructions, see [Managing Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/managing-deployments), in the _Vercel documentation_.

## Manage the Neon Vercel Integration

To view integration permissions, manage integration access, or remove the Neon integration:

1. On the Vercel dashboard, select **Settings** > **Integrations**.
1. Find the **Neon** integration and select **Manage**.

   <Admonition type="note">
   Removing the Neon Vercel Integration removes the Vercel environment variables set by the integration. It does not remove Neon branches created by the integration. To remove Neon branches, see [Delete a branch](/docs/manage/branches#delete-a-branch).

This guide describes how to manually connect a Vercel project to a Neon database.

<Admonition type="note">
For other Vercel integration options, refer to the [Neon and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- A Neon project. If you do not have one, see [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com).
- A project deployed to Vercel. If you do not have one, see [Creating a project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#creating-a-project), in the _Vercel documentation_.

## Gather your Neon connection details

You can these details from the **Connection Details** widget on the **Neon Dashboard**. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

The connection string includes the role name, hostname, and database name. For example:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
           ^              ^                                               ^
           |- <role>      |- <hostname>                                   |- <database>
```

- role name: `alex`
- hostname: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
- database name: `dbname`

## Configure project environment variables in Vercel

The environment variables required to connect your application to Neon depend on your application. Some applications use a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with a database connection string:

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Other applications may use `PG*` environment variables to define database connection details:

```text
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
```

<Admonition type="note">
Neon uses the default Postgres port, `5432`.
</Admonition>

To configure the environment variables required by your application:

<Admonition type="note">
Vercel environment variables can also be configured when you first deploy an application to Vercel.
</Admonition>

1. Navigate to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/).
1. Select your Vercel project.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Environment variables**.
1. Enter the environment variable name in the **Key** field and add the value.
1. Click **Add another** if you need to add more variables.

title: Neon OAuth integration
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-10-20T13:35:56.478Z'

You can integrate your application or service with Neon using OAuth. The Neon OAuth integration enables your application to interact with Neon user accounts, carrying out permitted actions on their behalf. Our integration does not require direct access to user login credentials and is conducted with their approval, ensuring data privacy and security.

To set up the integration and create a Neon OAuth application, you can apply on our [Partners page](https://neon.tech/partners). You will need to provide the following information:

1. Details about your application, including the application name, what it does, and a link to the website.
2. Callback URL(s), which are used to redirect users after completing the authorization flow. For example `https://yourapplication.com/api/oauth/callback`, `http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback`
3. Scopes, defining the type of access you require. Currently, we provide access to the following scopes:
   - Create Projects
   - Read Projects
   - Modify Projects
   - Delete Projects
4. Whether or not you will make API calls from a backend.
5. A logo to be displayed on Neon's OAuth consent dialog when users authorize your application to access their Neon account.

After your application is reviewed, we will get in touch with you and provide you with two credentials: a client ID and a client secret. These credentials are sensitive and should be stored securely.

## How the OAuth integration works

Here is a high-level overview of how Neon's OAuth implementation works:

![OAuth flow diagram](/docs/oauth/flow.png)

1. The user initiates the OAuth flow in your application by clicking a button or link.
2. An authorization URL is generated, and the user is redirected to Neonâs OAuth consent screen to authorize the application and grant the necessary permissions.
3. The application receives an access token to manage Neon resources on the userâs behalf.

## About the Neon OAuth server

The Neon OAuth server implements the OpenID Connect protocol and supports [OpenID Connect Discovery specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). The server metadata is published at the following well-known URL: [https://oauth2.neon.tech/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://oauth2.neon.tech/.well-known/openid-configuration).

Here is an example response:

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth",
  "token_endpoint": "https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/token",

  "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "none"],
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": ["plain", "S256"]
}
```

<Admonition type="note">
You must add `offline` and `offline_access` scopes to your request to receive the `refresh_token`.
</Admonition>

Depending on the OpenID client youâre using, you might not need to explicitly interact with the API endpoints listed below. OAuth 2.0 clients typically handle this interaction automatically. For example, the [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli), written in Typescript, interacts with the API endpoints automatically to retrieve the `refresh_token` and `access_token`. For an example, refer to this part of the Neon CLI [source code](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl/blob/main/src/auth.ts#L54-L71). In this example, the `oauthHost` is `https://oauth2.neon.tech`.

### 1. Initiating the OAuth flow

To initiate the OAuth flow, you need to generate an authorization URL. You can do that by directing your users to `https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth` while passing the following query parameters:

- `client_id`: your OAuth application's ID.
- `redirect_uri`: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
- `scope`: This is a space-separated list of scopes that you want to request access to. For example: `urn:neoncloud:projects:create urn:neoncloud:projects:read urn:neoncloud:projects:update urn:neoncloud:projects:delete`
- `response_type`: This should be set to `code` to indicate that you are using the [Authorization Code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).
- `code_challenge`: This is a random string that is used to verify the integrity of the authorization code.
- `state`: This is a random string that is returned to your callback URL. You can use this parameter to verify that the request came from your application and not from a third party.

Here is an example of what the authorization URL might look like:

```text
https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth?client_id=neon-experimental&scope=openid%20offline%20offline_access%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Acreate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aread%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aupdate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Adelete&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fneon&grant_type=authorization_code&state=H58y-rSTebc3QmNbRjNTX9dL73-IyoU2T_WNievO9as&code_challenge=99XcbwOFU6iEsvXr77Xxwsk9I0GL4c4c4Q8yPIVrF_0&code_challenge_method=S256
```

After being redirected to the authorization URL, the user is presented with Neon's consent screen, which is pre-populated with the scopes you requested. From the consent screen, the user is able to review the scopes and authorize the application to connect their Neon account.

![Neon OAuth consent screen](/docs/oauth/consent.png)

<Admonition type="note">
The Neon API provides a [Get current user details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getcurrentuserinfo) endpoint for retrieving information about the currently authorized Neon user.
</Admonition>

### 2. Authorization code is returned to your callback URL

After successfully completing the authorization flow, the user is redirected to the callback URL with the following query parameters appended to the URL:

- `code`: an authorization code that will be exchanged for an access token
- `scope`: the scopes that the user authorized your application to access
- `state`: you can compare the value of this parameter with the original `state` you provided in the previous step to ensure that the request came from your application and not from a third party

### 3. Exchanging the authorization code for an access token

You can now exchange the authorization code returned from the previous step for an access token. To do that, you need to send a `POST` request to `https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/token` with the following parameters:

- `client_id`: your OAuth application's ID.
- `redirect_uri`: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
- `client_secret`: your OAuth application's secret
- `grant_type`: set this to `authorization_code` to indicate that you are using the [Authorization Code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
- `code`: the authorization code returned from the previous step

The response object includes an `access_token` value, required for making requests to the Neon API on your users' behalf. This value must be supplied in the Authorization header of the HTTP request when sending requests to the Neon API.

## Example OAuth applications

The [Visualizing Neon Database Branches](https://neon-experimental.vercel.app) application leverages the Neon OAuth integration. You can find the example application code on GitHub.

# Manage billing with quotas

title: Manage billing with consumption limits
subtitle: Learn how to set usage quotas per project with the Neon API
enableTableOfContents: true
isDraft: false
updatedOn: '2023-11-10T14:21:35.348Z'
---

When setting up your billing solution with Neon, you may want to impose some hard limits on how much storage or compute resources a given project can consume. For example, you may want to cap how much usage your free tier users can consume versus pro or enterprise users. With the Neon API, you can use the `quota` key to set usage limits for a variety of consumption metrics. These limits act as thresholds after which all active computes for a project are [suspended](#suspending-active-computes). 

## Metrics and quotas
By default, Neon tracks a variety of consumption metrics at the project level. If you want to set quotas (max limits) for these metrics, you need to explicitly [configure](#configuring-quotas) them. 

### Available metrics

Here are the relevant metrics that you can track in order to understand your users' current consumption levels.

#### Project-level metrics

* `active_time_seconds`
* `compute_time_seconds`
* `written_data_bytes`
* `data_transfer_bytes` 

These consumption metrics represent total cumulative usage across all branches and computes in a given project, accrued so far in a given monthly billing period. Metrics are refreshed on the first day of the following month, when the new billing period starts. 

#### Branch-level metric

There is an additional value that you also might want to track: `logical_size`, which gives you the current size of a particular branch. 

Neon updates all metrics every 15 minutes but it could take up to 1 hour before they are reportable.

To find the current usage level for any of these metrics, see [retrieving details about a project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project). You can read more about these metrics and how they impact billing [here](/docs/introduction/billing).

### Corresponding quotas

You can set quotas for these consumption metrics per project using the `quote` object in the [Create project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) or [Update project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) API.

The `quota` object includes an array of parameters used to set threshold limits. Their names generally match their corresponding metric:

* `active_time_seconds` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of time your project's total compute endpoints are allowed to be active during the current billing period. It excludes time when computes are in an `Idle` state due to [auto-suspension](/docs/reference/glossary#auto-suspend-compute).
* `compute_time_seconds` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of CPU seconds allowed in total across all of a project's compute endpoints. This includes any endpoints deleted during the current billing period. Note that the larger the compute size per endpoint, the faster the project consumes `compute_time_seconds`. For example, 1 second at .25 vCPU costs .25 compute seconds, while 1 second at 4 vCPU costs 4 compute seconds.
   | vCPUs  | active_time_seconds | compute_time_seconds |
   |--------|-----------------------|------------------------|
   | 0.25   | 1                     | 0.25                   |
   | 4      | 1                     | 4                      |
* `written_data_bytes` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of data in total, measured in bytes, that can be written across all of a project's branches for the month.
* `data_transfer_bytes` &#8212; Sets the maximum amount of egress data, measured in bytes, that can be transferred out of Neon from across all of a project's branches using the proxy.

There is one additional `quota` parameter, `logical_size_bytes`, which applies to individual branches, not to the overall project. You can use `logical_size_bytes` to set the maximum size (measured in bytes) that any one individual branch is allowed to reach. Once this threshold is met, the compute for that particular branch (and _only_ that particular branch) is suspended. Note that this limit is _not_ refreshed once per month: it is a strict size limit that applies for the life of the branch.

### Sample quotas

Let's say you want to set limits for an application with two tiers, Trial and Pro, you might set limits like the following:

### Guidelines

Generally, the most effective quotas for controlling spend per project are those controlling maximum compute (`active_time_seconds` and `compute_time_seconds`) and maximum written storage (`written_data_bytes`). In practice, it is possible that `data_transfer_bytes` could introduce unintended logical constraints against your usage. For example, let's say you want to run a cleanup operation to reduce your storage. If part of this cleanup operation involves moving data across the network (for instance, to create an offsite backup before deletion), the `data_transfer_bytes` limit could prevent you from completing the operation &#8212; an undesirable situation where two measures meant to control cost interfere with one another.

### Neon Default Limits

In addition to the configurable limits that you can set, Neon also sets certain branch size limits by default. You might notice these limits in a [Get Project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project) response:
* `branch_logical_size_limit` (MiB)
* `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes `(Bytes)

These limits are not directly configurable. They act as "failsafe" limits to prevent runaway branch size growth due to possible issues with your application. If you need larger limits here, contact Neon Support.

For Neon Free Tier users, the limit is approximately 3 GiB per branch:
* `branch_logical_size_limit`: 3072
* `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes:` 3221225472

For Neon Pro Tier users, the limit is approximately 200 GiB per branch:
* `branch_logical_size_limit`: 204800
* `branch_logical_size_limit_bytes`: 214748364800

## Suspending active computes

_**What happens when the quota is met?**_

When any configured metric reaches its quota limit, all active computes for that project are automatically suspended. It is important to understand, this suspension is persistent. It works differently than the inactivity-based [autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide), where computes restart at the next interaction: this suspend will _not_ restart at the next API call or incoming connection. If you don't take explicit action otherwise, the suspension remains in place until the end of the current billing period starts (`consumption_period_end`).

See [Querying metrics and quotas](#querying-metrics-and-quotas) to find your reset date, billing period, and other values related to the project's consumption.

<Admonition type="Note">
Neon tracks these consumption metrics on a monthly cycle. If you want to track metrics on a different cycle, you need to take snapshots of your metrics at the desired interval and store the data externally. You can also use the Preview [Consumption API](#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) to collect metrics from across a range of billing periods. 
</Admonition>

## Configuring quotas

You can set quotas using the Neon API either in a `POST` when you create a project or a `PATCH` to update an existing project:
* [Set quotas when you create the project](#set-quotas-when-you-create-the-project)
* [Update an existing project](#update-an-existing-project)

### Set quotas when you create the project
For performance reasons, you might want to configure these quotas at the same time that you create a new project for your user using the [Create a project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject) API, reducing the number of API calls you need to make.

Here is a sample `POST` in `curl` that creates a new project called `UserNew` and sets the `active_time_seconds` quota to a total allowed time of 10 hours (36,000 seconds) for the month, and a total allowed `compute_time_seconds` set to 2.5 hours (9,000 seconds) for the month. This 4:1 ratio between active and compute time is suitable for a fixed compute size of 0.25 vCPU.

<CodeBlock highlight="11,12">
```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "quota": {
        "active_time_seconds": 36000,
        "compute_time_seconds": 9000
      }
    },
    "pg_version": 15,
    "name": "UserProject"
  }
}
' | jq
```
</CodeBlock>


### Update an existing project
If you need to change the quota limits for an existing project &#8212; for example, if a user switches their plan to a higher usage tier &#8212; you can reset those limits via `PATCH` request. See [Update a project](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateproject) in the Neon API.

Here is a sample `PATCH` that updates both the `active_time_seconds` and `compute_time_seconds` quotas to 30 hours (108,000):

<CodeBlock highlight="11,12">
```bash
curl --request PATCH \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/[project_ID]\
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project": {
    "settings": {
      "quota": {
        "active_time_seconds": 108000,
        "compute_time_seconds": 108000
      }
    }
  }
}
' | jq
```
</CodeBlock>

## Querying metrics and quotas

You can get metrics and quota details for a single project or a list of metrics for all projects at once:
* [Per project](#retrieving-details-about-a-project)
* [All projects](#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects)

### Retrieving details about a project

Using a `GET` request from the Neon API (see [Get project details](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getproject)), you can find the following consumption details for a given project:
* Current consumption metrics accumulated for the billing period
* Start and end dates for the billing period
* Current usage quotas (max limits) configured for the project

Using these details, you can set up the logic for when to send notification warnings, when to reset a quota, and other possible actions related to the pending or current suspension of a project's active computes.

Here is an example a `GET` request for an individual project.

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/[project_ID] \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' | jq
```

Looking at this response, here are some conclusions we can draw:

* **This project is _1 hour away_ from being suspended.**
  
  With current `compute_time_seconds` at _68,400_ (19 hours) and the quota for that metric set at _72,000_ (20 hours), the project is only _1 hour_ of compute time away from being suspended.

* **This project is _1 day away_ from a quota refresh.**

  If today's date is _October 31st, 2023_, and the `consumption_period_end` parameter is _2023-11-01T00:00:00Z_ (November 1st, 2023), then the project has _1 day_ left before all quota parameters (except for `logical_byte_size`) are refreshed.

### Retrieving metrics for all projects

Instead of retrieving metrics for a single project per request, you can use the [Consumption API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption) to get a full list of key consumption metrics for all the projects in your Neon account in a single API request. You can specify a date range to get metrics from across multiple billing periods and control pagination for large result sets.

<Admonition type="Warning" title="Preview API">
This functionality is part of the preview API and is subject to change in the future.
</Admonition>

Here is the URL in the Neon API where you can get details for all projects in your account:

```bash
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption/projects
```
This API endpoint accepts the following query parameters: `from`,`to`, `limit`, and `cursor`.

#### Set a date range across multiple billing periods

You can set `from` and `to` query parameters to define a time range that can span across multiple billing periods. 
* `from` â Sets the start date and time of the time period for which you are seeking metrics.
* `to` â Sets the end date and time for the  the interval for which you desire metrics.

The response is organized by project and billing period: one object per project, per active billing period within the range. For example, if you choose a 6-month time range you will get up to 6 objects for every project active within those months. The response includes any projects deleted within that time range.

If you do not include these parameters, the query defaults to the current consumption period. 

Here is an example query that returns metrics from September 1st and December 1st, 2023. Time values must be provided  in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/).

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>
```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption/projects?limit=10&from=2023-09-01T00%3A00%3A00Z&to=2023-12-01T00%3A00%3A00Z' \

* The `cursor` object under `pagination` shows the last project Id in the response. See more about pagination in the next section.

#### Control pagination for large result sets

To control pagination (number of results per response), you can include these query parameters:
* `limit` &#8212; sets the number of project objects to be included in the response
* `cursor` &#8212; by default, the response uses the project `id` from the last project in the list as the `cursor` value (included in the `pagination` object at the end of the response). Generally, it is up to the application to collect and use this cursor value when setting up the next request.

Here is an example `GET` request asking for the next 100 projects, starting with project id `divine-tree-77657175`:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>
```bash
curl --request GET \

## Resetting a project after suspend
Projects remain suspended until the next billing period. It is good practice to notify your users when they are close to reaching a limit; if the user is then suspended and loses access to their database, it will not be unexpected. If you have configured no further actions, the user will have to wait until the next billing period starts to resume usage.

Alternatively, you can actively reset a suspended compute by changing the impacted quota to `0`: this effectively removes the limit entirely. You will need to reset this quota at some point if you want to maintain limits.

### Using quotas to actively suspend a user
If you want to suspend a user for any reason &#8212; for example, suspicious activity or payment issues &#8212; you can use these quotas to actively suspend a given user. For example, setting `active_time_limit` to a very low threshold (e.g., `1`) will force a suspension if the user has 1 second of active compute for that month. To remove this suspension, you can set the threshold temporarily to `0` (infinite) or some value larger than their currently consumed usage.

## Other consumption related settings

In addition to setting quota limits against the project as a whole, there are other sizing-related settings you might want to use to control the amount of resources any particular endpoint is able to consume:
* `autoscaling_limit_min_cu` &#8212; Sets the minimium compute size for the endpoint. The default minimum is .25 vCPU but can be increased if your user's project could benefit from a larger compute start size.
* `autoscaling_limit_max_cu` &#8212; Sets a hard limit on how much compute an endpoint can consume in response to increased demand. For more info on min and max cpu limits, see [Autoscaling](/docs/guides/autoscaling-guide).
* `suspend_timeout_seconds` &#8212; Sets how long an endpoint's allotted compute will remain active with no current demand. After the timeout period, the endpoint is suspended until demand picks up. For more info, see [Autosuspend](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).

There are several ways you can set these endpoint settings using the Neon API: you can set project-level defaults that apply for any new computes created in the project, you can define the endpoint settings when creating a new branch, or you can adjust these settings when creating or updating an endpoint for an existing branch.

See these sample CURL requests for each method.

<Tabs labels={["Project", "Branch","Endpoint"]}>

In this sample, we are setting defaults for all new endpoints created in the project as a whole. The minimum compute size is at **1 vCPU**, the max size at **3 vCPU**, and a 10 minute (**600 seconds**) inactivty period before the endpoint is suspended.

Vector databases enable efficient storage and retrieval of vector data, which is an essential component in building AI applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI.

Neon supports the `pgvector` open-source extension, which enables Postgres as a vector database for storing and querying vector embeddings. By enabling Postgres as a vector database, you can keep your data in the open source database that you know and trust. There's no need for data migration or a proprietary vector storage solution.

To get started, see [The pgvector extension](/docs/extensions/pgvector).

Embeddings are an essential component in building AI applications. Ths topic describes embeddings and how they are used in building AI and LLM applications.

## What are embeddings?

When working with unstructured data, a common objective is to transform it into a more structured format that is easier to analyze and retrieve. This transformation can be achieved through the use of 'embeddings', which are vectors containing an array of floating-point numbers that represent the features or dimensions of the data. For example, a sentence like "The cow jumped over the moon" could be represented by an embedding that looks like this: [0.5, 0.3, 0.1].

The advantage of embeddings is that they allow us to measure the similarity between different pieces of text. By calculating the distance between two embeddings, we can assess their relatedness - the smaller the distance, the greater the similarity, and vice versa. This quality is particularly useful as it enables embeddings to capture the underlying meaning of the text.

Take the following three sentences, for example:

- Sentence 1: "The cow jumped over the moon."
- Sentence 2: "The bovine leapt above the celestial body."
- Sentence 3: "I enjoy eating pancakes."

You can determine the most similar sentences by following these steps:

1. Generate embeddings for each sentence. For illustrative purposes, assume these values represent actual embeddings:

    - Embedding for sentence 1 â [0.5, 0.3, 0.1]
    - Embedding for sentence 2 â [0.6, 0.29, 0.12]
    - Embedding for sentence 3 â [0.1, -0.2, 0.4]

2. Compute the distance between all pairs of embeddings (1 & 2, 2 & 3, and 1 & 3).

3. Identify the pair of embeddings with the shortest distance between them.

When we apply this process, it is likely that sentences 1 and 2, both of which involve bounding cattle, would emerge as the most related according to a distance calculation.

## Vector similarity search

The method of transforming data into embeddings and computing similarities between one or more items is referred to as vector search or similarity search. This process has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

- **Information retrieval:** By representing user queries as vectors, we can perform more accurate searches based on the meaning behind the queries, allowing us to retrieve more relevant information.
- **Natural language processing:** Embeddings capture the essence of the text, making them excellent tools for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Recommendation systems:** Using vector similarity, we can recommend items that are similar to a given item, whether they be movies, products, books, or otherwise. This technique allows us to create more personalized and relevant recommendations.
- **Anomaly detection:** By determining the similarity between items within a dataset, we can identify outliers or anomaliesâitems that don't quite fit the pattern. This can be crucial in many fields, from cybersecurity to quality control.

### Distance metrics

Vector similarity search computes similarities (the distance) between data points. Calculating how 'far apart' data points are helps us understand the relationship between them. Distance can be computed in different ways using different metrics. Some popular distance metrics include:

- Euclidean (L2): Often referred to as the "ordinary" distance you'd measure with a ruler.
- Manhattan (L1): Also known as "taxicab" or "city block" distance.
- Cosine: This calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

Different distance metrics can be more appropriate for different tasks, depending on the nature of the data and the specific relationships you're interested in. For instance, cosine similarity is often used in text analysis.

## Generating embeddings

A common approach to generate embeddings is to use OpenAIâs Embeddings API. This API allows you to input a text string into an API endpoint, which then returns the corresponding embedding. The "cow jumped over the moon" example above is a simplistic example with 3 dimensions. Most embedding models generate a much larger number of embeddings. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model, for example, generates 1536 embeddings.

Here's an example of how to use OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to generate an embedding:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "text-embedding-ada-002"
  }'
```

<Admonition type="note">
Running the command above requires an OpenAI API key, which must be obtained from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
</Admonition>

Upon successful execution, you'll receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "index": 0,
      "embedding": [
        -0.007009038,
        -0.0053659794,
        ...
        -0.00010458116,
        -0.024071306
      ]
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-ada-002-v2",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 5,
    "total_tokens": 5
  }
}
```

To learn more about OpenAI's embeddings, see [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## Storing vector embeddings in Postgres

Neon supports the [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) and [pg_embedding](/docs/extensions/pg_embedding) Postgres extensions, which enable storing and retrieving vector embeddings directly within your Postgres database. When building AI and LLM applications, installing either of these extensions eliminates the need to build out your architecture to include a separate vector store.

After installing an extension, you can create a table to store your embeddings. For example, if you install the `pgvector` extension, you might define a table similar to the following to store your embeddings:

```sql
CREATE TABLE items(id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, embedding VECTOR(1536));
```

To add embeddings to the table, you would insert the data as shown:

```sql
INSERT INTO items(embedding) VALUES ('[
    -0.006929283495992422,
    -0.005336422007530928,
    ...
    -4.547132266452536e-05,
    -0.024047505110502243
]');
```

## Building AI apps with embeddings

The concepts described above provide an introduction to the basic building blocks for developing an AI application with embeddings. You can see how they fit with the general process, which involves these steps:

1. Generate embeddings from your data
2. Store the embeddings in your database
3. Build an interface that prompts for user for input
4. Generate an embedding for the provided user input
5. Perform a similarity search that compares the embedding generated for the provided input against the embeddings stored in your database
6. Return the most similar data to the user

For example applications built based on this general process, see the following:

Neon offers the following features enabling you to build scalable AI and LLM applications that meet workload demand while managing costs.

## Autoscaling

With Neon, you do not have to pick a size for your database upfront. Neon is able to automatically allocate compute resources to meet demand. This is made possible by Neonâs architecture, which separates storage and compute, allowing compute resources to be managed independently.

Neon's _Autoscaling_ feature automatically scales up compute on demand in response to application workload and down to zero on inactivity, and you are only charged for the compute resources you use.

For example, if your AI application experiences heavy load during certain hours of the day or at different times throughout the week, month, or calendar year, Neon automatically scales compute resources without manual intervention according to the compute size boundaries that you configure. This enables you to handle peak demand while avoiding paying for compute resources during periods of low activity.

To learn more about Neon's Autoscaling feature and how to enable it, refer to our [Autoscaling guide](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Read replicas

Neon supports regional read replicas, which are independent read-only compute instances designed to perform read operations on the same data as your read-write computes. Read replicas do not replicate data across database instances. Instead, read requests are directed to a single source. This architecture enables read replicas to be created instantly, and because data is read from a single source, there are additional storage costs.

Since vector similarity search is a read-only workload, you can leverage read replicas to offload reads from your read-write compute instance to a dedicated read-only compute when deploying AI and LLM applications. After you create a read replica, you can simply swap out your current Neon database connecting string for the read replica connection string, which makes deploying a read replica for your AI application very simple.

To learn more about the Neon read replica feature, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) and refer to our [Working with Neon read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) guide.

## The Neon serverless driver

Neon supports a low-latency serverless Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript applications that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over HTTP or WebSockets in place of TCP.

The driver is a drop-in replacement for [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), the popular `npm pg` package you may already be familiar with.

With the Neon serverless driver, you can reduce query latencies for your AI applications, making it possible to achieve sub-10ms Postgres queries when querying from Edge functions.

See [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) to learn more.


# pgvector

title: The pgvector extension
subtitle: Use the pgvector for vector similarity search in Postgres
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.748Z'

The `pgvector` extension enables you to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search in Postgres. It is particularly useful for applications involving natural language processing, such as those built on top of OpenAI's GPT models. This topic describes how to enable the `pgvector` extension in Neon and how to create, store, and query vectors.

## Enable the pgvector extension

You can enable the `pgvector` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Create a table to store vectors

To create a table for storing vectors, use the following SQL command, adjusting the dimensions as needed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding VECTOR(3)
);
```

The command generates a table named `items` with an `embedding` column capable of storing vectors with 3 dimensions. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model supports 1536 dimensions for each piece of text, which creates more accurate embeddings for natural language processing tasks. For more information about embeddings, see [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings), in the _OpenAI documentation_.

## Storing vectors and embeddings

After you have generated an embedding using a service like the OpenAI API, you can store the resulting vector in your database. Using a Postgres client library in your preferred programming language, you can execute an `INSERT` statement similar to the following to store embeddings:

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

This command inserts two new rows into the items table with the provided embeddings.

## Querying vectors

To retrieve vectors and calculate similarity, use `SELECT` statements and the built-in vector operators. For instance, you can find the top 5 most similar items to a given embedding using the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

This query computes the Euclidean distance (L2 distance) between the given vector and the vectors stored in the items table, sorts the results by the calculated distance, and returns the top 5 most similar items.

`pgvector` also supports inner product (`<#>`) and cosine distance (`<=>`).

For more information about querying vectors, refer to the [pgvector README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Indexing vectors

Using an index on the vector column can improve query performance with a minor cost in recall.

You can add an index for each distance function you want to use. For example, the following query adds an ivfflat index to the `embedding` column for the L2 distance function:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

This query adds an HNSW index to the `embedding` column for the L2 distance function:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

For additional indexing guidance and examples, see [Indexing](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/tree/8bf360ed84bfdeba9caa19e9f193fd9ad8dd9e73#indexing), in the _pgvector README_.

<Admonition type="note">
If you encounter an error similar to the following while attempting to create an index, you can increase the `maintenance_work_mem` setting to the required amount of memory using a `SET` or `ALTER DATABASE` statement.

```text
ERROR: memory required is 202 MB, maintenance_work_mem is 67 MB
```

The default `maintenance_work_mem` setting depends on your [compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration). The `SET` statement changes the value for the current session. `ALTER DATABASE` updates the session default.

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem TO '205MB';
```

or

```sql
ALTER DATABASE <dbname> SET maintenance_work_mem TO '205MB';
```

Always consider your compute instance's memory resources when adjusting this parameter, as setting it too high could lead to out-of-memory situations or unexpected behavior.

title: The pg_tiktoken extension
subtitle: Efficiently tokenize data in your Postgres database using OpenAI's `tiktoken`
  library
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.747Z'
---

The `pg_tiktoken` extension enables fast and efficient tokenization of data in your Postgres database using OpenAI's [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library.

This topic provides guidance on installing the extension, utilizing its features for tokenization and token management, and integrating the extension with ChatGPT models.

## What is a token?

Language models process text in units called tokens. A token can be as short as a single character or as long as a complete word, such as "a" or "apple." In some languages, tokens may comprise less than a single character or even extend beyond a single word.

For example, consider the sentence "Neon is serverless Postgres." It can be divided into seven tokens: ["Ne", "on", "is", "server", "less", "Post", "gres"].

## `pg_tiktoken` functions

The `pg_tiktoken` offers two functions:

- `tiktoken_encode`: Accepts text inputs and returns tokenized output, allowing you to seamlessly tokenize your text data.
- `tiktoken_count`: Counts the number of tokens in a given text. This feature helps you adhere to text length limits, such as those set by OpenAI's language models.

## Install the `pg_tiktoken` extension

You can install the `pg_tiktoken` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_tiktoken
```

For information about using the Neon **SQL Editor**, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Use the `tiktoken_encode` function

The `tiktoken_encode` function tokenizes text input and returns a tokenized output. The function accepts encoding names and OpenAI model names as the first argument and the text you want to tokenize as the second argument, as shown:

```sql
SELECT tiktoken_encode('text-davinci-003', 'The universe is a vast and captivating mystery, waiting to be explored and understood.');

tiktoken_encode 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {464,6881,318,257,5909,290,3144,39438,10715,11,4953,284,307,18782,290,7247,13}
(1 row)
```

The function tokenizes text using the [Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) algorithm.

## Use the `tiktoken_count` function

The `tiktoken_count` function counts the number of tokens in a text. The function accepts encoding names and OpenAI model names as the first argument and text as the second argument, as shown:

```sql
neondb=> SELECT tiktoken_count('text-davinci-003', 'The universe is a vast and captivating mystery, waiting to be explored and understood.');

 tiktoken_count 
----------------
             17
(1 row)
```

## Supported models

The `tiktoken_count` and `tiktoken_encode` functions accept both encoding and OpenAI model names as the first argument:

```text
tiktoken_count(<encoding or model>,<text>)
```

The following models are supported:

| Encoding name      | OpenAI model                                      |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| cl100k_base        | ChatGPT models, text-embedding-ada-002            |
| p50k_base          | Code models, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003    |
| p50k_edit          | Use for edit models like text-davinci-edit-001, code-davinci-edit-001 |
| r50k_base (or gpt2)| GPT-3 models like davinci                         |

## Integrate `pg_tiktoken` with ChatGPT models

The `pg_tiktoken` extension allows you to store chat message history in a Postgres database and retrieve messages that comply with OpenAI's model limitations.

For example, consider the `message` table below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE message (
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- equals to 'system', 'user' or 'assistant'
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  n_tokens INTEGER -- number of content tokens
);
```

The [gpt-3.5-turbo chat model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction) requires specific parameters:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."}
    ]
}
```

The `messages` parameter is an array of message objects, with each object containing two pieces of information: The `role` of the message sender (either `system`, `user`, or `assistant`) and the actual message `content`. Conversations can be brief, with just one message, or span multiple pages as long as the combined message tokens do not exceed the 4096-token limit.

To insert `role`, `content`, and the number of tokens into the database, use the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO message (role, content, n_tokens)
VALUES ('user', 'Hello, how are you?', tiktoken_count('text-davinci-003','Hello, how are you?'));
```

## Manage text tokens

When a conversation contains more tokens than a model can process (e.g., over 4096 tokens for `gpt-3.5-turbo`), you will need to truncate the text to fit within the model's limit.

Additionally, lengthy conversations may result in incomplete replies. For example, if a `gpt-3.5-turbo` conversation spans 4090 tokens, the response will be limited to just six tokens.

The following query retrieves messages up to your desired token limits:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT role, content, created, n_tokens,
         SUM(tokens) OVER (ORDER BY created DESC) AS cumulative_sum
  FROM message
)

SELECT role, content, created, n_tokens, cumulative_sum
FROM cte
WHERE cumulative_sum <= <MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS>;
```

`<MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS>` represents the conversation history you want to keep for chat completion, following this formula:

```text
MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = MODEL_MAX_TOKENS â NUM_SYSTEM_TOKENS â NUM_COMPLETION_TOKENS
```

For example, assume the desired completion length is 100 tokens (`NUM_COMPLETION_TOKENS=90`).

```text
MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = 4096 â 6 â 90 = 4000
```

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", // MODEL_MAX_TOKENS = 4096
  "messages": [
         {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, // NUM_SYSTEM_TOKENS = 6
         {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
         {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
         {"role": ...}
         .
         .
         .
         {"role": "user", "content": "Great! Have a great day."}  // MAX_HISTORY_TOKENS = 4000
    ] 
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `pg_tiktoken` extension is a valuable tool for tokenizing text data and managing tokens within Postgres databases. By leveraging OpenAI's tiktoken library, it simplifies the process of tokenization and working with token limits, enabling you to integrate more easily with with OpenAI's language models.

As you explore the capabilities of the `pg_tiktoken extension`, we encourage you to provide feedback and suggest features you'd like to see added in future updates. We look forward to seeing the innovative natural language processing applications you create using `pg_tiktoken`.

title: The pg_embedding extension (Support Discontinued)
subtitle: null
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.747Z'
---

<Admonition type="warning">
As of **Sept 29, 2023**, Neon is no longer committing to `pg_embedding`.

Support will remain in place for existing users of the extension, but we strongly encourage migrating to [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

For migration instructions, see [Migrate from pg_embedding to pgvector](#migrate-from-pg_embedding-to-pgvector).
</Admonition>

## Migrate from pg_embedding to pgvector

The `pg_embedding` extension stores embeddings in `real[]` type columns, while `pgvector` uses `vector` type columns. To migrate from `pg_embedding` to `pg_vector`, you have two options:

- **Use casting**: Keep your embeddings data as it is, in `real[]` type columns, and cast from `real[]` to `vector` in your queries and index creation statements.
- **Use the vector type**: Recreate your table using the `vector` type instead of `real[]`. This method requires copying data from one table to another.

Both migration methods are described below.

The migration instructions are based on the following setup, which has the `pg_embedding` extension installed, a table named `documents` defined with a `real[]` column named `embedding`, and an `hnsw` index defined on the `embeddings` column. You have to adapt the queries in the migration instructions according to your setup.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION embedding;
CREATE TABLE documents(id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, embedding real[]);
INSERT INTO documents(embedding) VALUES ('{1,2,3}'),('{4,5,6}');
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw(embedding) WITH (dims=3, m=3, efconstruction=5, efsearch=5);
```

### Migration option 1: Use casting

To migrate to `pgvector` without altering the `embeddings` column type, and cast from `real[]` to `vector`:

1. Drop the `pg_embedding` extension:

    ```sql
    DROP EXTENSION embedding CASCADE;
    ```

    The `CASCADE` clause removes the HNSW index that you defined with `pg_embedding`, which means that search queries fall back to using sequential scans until you install `pgvector` and recreate your index.

2. Create the `pgvector` extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    ```

3. Update your queries to cast embeddings data from `real[]` to `vector`. For example, the following query casts embeddings data stored in the `embedding` column, defined as a `real[]`, to `vector`.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM documents ORDER BY embedding::vector <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
    ```

4. Recreate your index, casting the `real[]` type column to `vector`, as shown:

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw ((embedding::vector(3)) vector_cosine_ops);
    ```

### Migration option 2: Use the vector type

To migrate to `pgvector`, changing your `embeddings` column type from `real[]` to `vector`:

1. Drop the `pg_embedding` extension:

    ```sql
    DROP EXTENSION embedding CASCADE;
    ```

    The `CASCADE` clause removes the HNSW index that you defined with `pg_embedding`, which means that search queries fall back to using sequential scans until you install `pgvector` and recreate your index.

2. Create the `pgvector` extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION vector;
    ```

3. Create a new table with the `vector` type:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE new_documents (id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
    ```

4. Copy data over from your old table:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO new_documents (id, embedding)
    SELECT id, embedding::vector(3) FROM documents;
    ```

5. Drop the old table:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE documents;
    ```

6. Rename the new table to the name of the old table:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE new_documents RENAME TO documents;
    ```

7. Recreate your index. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
    ```

8. Optionally, run a test query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
    ```

## About pg_embedding

The `pg_embedding` extension enables the use of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for vector similarity search in Postgres.

This extension is based on [ivf-hnsw](https://github.com/dbaranchuk/ivf-hnsw) implementation of HNSW
the code for the current state-of-the-art billion-scale nearest neighbor search system<sup>[[1]](https://github.com/neondatabase/pg_embedding#references)</sup>.

Neon also supports `pgvector` for vector similarity search. See [The pgvector extension](/docs/extensions/pgvector).

## Using the pg_embedding extension

This section describes how to use the `pg_embedding` extension in Neon with simple examples demonstrating the required statements, syntax, and options.

### Usage summary

The statements in this summary are described in further detail in the sections that follow.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION embedding;
CREATE TABLE documents(id integer PRIMARY KEY, embedding real[]);
INSERT INTO documents(id, embedding) VALUES (1, '{0,1,2}'), (2, '{1,2,3}'),  (3, '{1,1,1}');
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <-> ARRAY[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

### Enable the extension

<Admonition type="warning">
The `pg_embedding` extension is no longer available for installation in Neon. Please refer to the notice at the top of the page.
</Admonition>

To enable the `pg_embedding` extension, run the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon [SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or from a client such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION embedding;
```

### Create a table for your vector data

To store your vector data, create a table similar to the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents(id INTEGER, embedding real[]);
```

This statement generates a table named `documents` with a `real[]` type column for storing vector data. Your table and vector column names may differ.

### Insert data

To insert vector data, use an `INSERT` statement similar to the following:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```sql
INSERT INTO documents(id, embedding) VALUES (1, '{0,1,2}'), (2, '{1,2,3}'),  (3, '{1,1,1}');
```

</CodeBlock>

## Similarity search

The `pg_embedding` extension supports Euclidean (L2), cosine, and Manhattan distance metrics.

Euclidean (L2) distance:

```sql
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <-> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

Cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <=> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

Manhattan distance:

```sql
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <~> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

where:

- `SELECT id FROM documents` selects the `id` field from all records in the `documents` table.
- `ORDER BY` sorts the selected records in ascending order based on the calculated distances. In other words, records with values closer to the `[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]` query vector according to the distance metric will be returned first.
- `<->`, `<=>`, and `<~>` operators define the distance metric, which calculates the distance between the query vector and each row of the dataset.
- `LIMIT 1` limits the result set to one record after sorting. You can adjust this value as required.

In summary, the query retrieves the ID of the record from the `documents` table whose value is closest to the `[3,3,3]` query vector according to the specified distance metric.

### Create an HNSW index

To optimize search behavior, you can add an HNSW index. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use a `CREATE INDEX` statement as shown in the following examples. The `pg_embedding` extension supports indexes for use with Euclidean, cosine, and Manhattan distance metrics. You must ensure that your search query syntax matches the index that you define. You will notice in the query examples below that each distance metric has a specific operator (`<->`, `<=>`, and `<~>`).

Euclidean (L2) distance index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw(embedding) WITH (dims=3, m=3, efconstruction=5, efsearch=5);
SET enable_seqscan = off;
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <-> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

Cosine distance index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw(embedding ann_cos_ops) WITH (dims=3, m=3, efconstruction=5, efsearch=5);
SET enable_seqscan = off;
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <=> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

Manhattan distance index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING hnsw(embedding ann_manhattan_ops) WITH (dims=3, m=3, efconstruction=5, efsearch=5);
SET enable_seqscan = off;
SELECT id FROM documents ORDER BY embedding <~> array[3,3,3] LIMIT 1;
```

### Tuning the HNSW algorithm

The following options allow you to tune the HNSW algorithm when creating an index:

- `dims`: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data.  This is a required parameter.
- `m`: Defines the maximum number of links or "edges" created for each node during graph construction. A higher value increases accuracy (recall) but also increases the size of the index in memory and index construction time.
- `efconstruction`: Influences the trade-off between index quality and construction speed. A high `efconstruction` value creates a higher quality graph, enabling more accurate search results, but a higher value also means that index construction takes longer.
- `efsearch`: Influences the trade-off between query accuracy (recall) and speed. A higher `efsearch` value increases accuracy at the cost of speed. This value should be equal to or larger than `k`, which is the number of nearest neighbors you want your search to return (defined by the `LIMIT` clause in your `SELECT` query).

In summary, to prioritize search speed over accuracy, use lower values for `m` and `efsearch`. Conversely, to prioritize accuracy over search speed, use a higher value for `m` and `efsearch`. A higher `efconstruction` value enables more accurate search results at the cost of index build time, which is also affected by the size of your dataset.

For an idea of how to configure index option values, consider the benchmark performed by Neon using the _GIST-960 Euclidean dataset_, which provides a training set of 1 million vectors of 960 dimensions. The benchmark was run with this series of index option values:

- `dims`: 960
- `m`: 32, 64, and 128.
- `efconstruction`: 64, 128, and 256
- `efsearch`: 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512

For a million rows of data, we recommend an `m` setting between 48 and 64, and as mentioned [above](#tuning-the-hnsw-algorithm), `efsearch` should be equal to or larger than the number of nearest neighbors you want your search to return.

To learn more about the benchmark, see [Introducing pg_embedding extension for vector search in Postgres and LangChain](https://neon.tech/blog/pg-embedding-extension-for-vector-search). Try experimenting with different settings to find the ones that work best for your particular application.

## How HNSW search works

HNSW is a graph-based approach to indexing multi-dimensional data. It constructs a multi-layered graph, where each layer is a subset of the previous one. During a search, the algorithm navigates through the graph from the top layer to the bottom to quickly find the nearest neighbor. An HNSW graph is known for its superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy.

![HNSW graph](/docs/extensions/hnsw_graph.png)

The search process begins at the topmost layer of the HNSW graph. From the starting node, the algorithm navigates to the nearest neighbor in the same layer. The algorithm repeats this step until it can no longer find neighbors more similar to the query vector.

Using the found node as an entry point, the algorithm moves down to the next layer in the graph and repeats the process of navigating to the nearest neighbor. The process of navigating to the nearest neighbor and moving down a layer is repeated until the algorithm reaches the bottom layer.

In the bottom layer, the algorithm continues navigating to the nearest neighbor until it cannot find any nodes that are more similar to the query vector. The current node is then returned as the most similar node to the query vector.

The key idea behind HNSW is that by starting the search at the top layer and moving down through each layer, the algorithm can quickly navigate to the area of the graph that contains the node that is most similar to the query vector. This makes the search process much faster than if it had to search through every node in the graph.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.
You can use Google Colab to run python code through the browser.

This guide shows how to create a notebook in Colab, connect to a Neon database, install the `pgvector` extension to enabled Neon as a vector store, and run a vector search query.

## Prerequisites

To perform the steps in this guide, you require a Neon database for storing vectors. You can use the ready-to-use `neondb` database or create your own. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

## Retrieve your database connection string

In the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

![Connection details widget](/docs/connect/connection_details.png)

## Create a notebook

In your browser, navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and click **New notebook**.

![Google Colab](/docs/ai/google_colab.png)

Alternatively, you can open a predefined Google Colab notebook for this guide by clicking the **Open in Colab** button below.

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neondatabase/neon-google-colab-notebooks/blob/main/neon_pgvector_quickstart.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

## Connect to your database

1. In your Colab notebook, create a code block to define your database connection and create a cursor object. Replace `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]` with the database connection string you retrieved in the previous step.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```python
    import os
    import psycopg2

    # Provide your Neon connection string
    connection_string = "postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]"

    # Connect using the connection string
    connection = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)

    # Create a new cursor object
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

3. Add a code block for testing the database connection.

    ```python
    # Execute this query to test the database connection
    cursor.execute("SELECT 1;")
    result = cursor.fetchone()

    # Check the query result
    if result == (1,):
        print("Your database connection was successful!")
    else:
        print("Your connection failed.")
    ```

4. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Install the pgvector extension

1. Create a codeblock to install the `pgvector` extension to enable your Neon database as a vector store:

    ```python
    # Execute this query to install the pgvector extension
    cursor.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;")
    ```

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Create a table and add vector data

1. Add a code block to create a table and insert data:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```python
    create_table_sql = '''
    CREATE TABLE items (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding VECTOR(3)
    );
    '''

    # Insert data
    insert_data_sql = '''
    INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]'), ('[7,8,9]');
    '''

    # Execute the SQL statements
    cursor.execute(create_table_sql)
    cursor.execute(insert_data_sql)

    # Commit the changes
    connection.commit()
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Query your data

1. Add a codeblock to perform a vector similarity search.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```python
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 3;")
    all_data = cursor.fetchall()
    print(all_data)
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

2. Execute the code block (**Ctrl** + **Enter**).

## Install an extension

Unless otherwise noted, supported extensions can be installed using [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createextension.html) syntax.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name>
```

You can install extensions from the Neon SQL Editor or from a client such as `psql` that permits running SQL queries. For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Update an extension version

Neon updates supported extensions as new versions become available. Version updates are communicated in the [Changelog](/docs/changelog). To check the current version of extensions you have installed, query the `pg_extension` table:

```bash
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

You can update an extension to the latest version using `ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO <new_version>` syntax. For example:

  ```sql
  ALTER EXTENSION postgis_topology UPDATE TO '3.3.2';
  ```

<Admonition type="important">
When Neon releases a new extension or new extension version, a compute restart is required to make the new extension or extension version available for installation or update. A compute restart may occur on its own due to Neon's default [Auto-suspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend) behavior. However, if your compute never restarts because you disabled Auto-suspend or because your compute is constantly active, you may need force a restart. To force a restart, Neon Pro Plan users can temporarily set a compute's **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting to 1 second (the default is 5 minutes). See [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) for instructions. After doing so, check the **Operations** page in the Neon Console to see if your compute endpoint restarted. Look for `suspend_compute` and `start_compute` actions. Alternatively, all Neon users can issue [Suspend endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/suspendprojectendpoint) and [Start endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/startprojectendpoint) API calls. Please be aware that restarting a compute endpoint temporarily interrupts any connections currently using the compute.
</Admonition>

## Extension support notes

- Neon supports the `uuid-ossp` extension for generating UUIDs instead of the `uuid` extension.
- The `sslinfo` extension is not supported. Neon handles connections via a proxy that checks SSL.
- The `pg_cron` extension is not supported. Neon scales to zero when it is not being used, which means that a scheduler that runs inside the database cannot be implemented. Consider using an scheduler that runs externally instead.
- The `file_fdw` extension is not supported. Files would not remain accessible when Neon scales to zero.

## Request extension support

To request support for a Postgres extension, please post your request to the [Neon community forum](https://community.neon.tech/). [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can open a support ticket from the console. For more detail, see [Getting Support](/docs/introduction/support).

### Custom-built extensions

Neon supports custom-built Postgres extensions for exclusive use with your Neon account. If you developed your own Postgres extension and want to use it with Neon, please post your request to the [Neon community forum](https://community.neon.tech/). [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can open a support ticket from the console. For more detail, see [Getting Support](/docs/introduction/support). Please include the following information in your request:

- A repository link or archive file containing the source code for your extension
- A description of what the extension does, instructions for compiling it, and any prerequisites
- Whether an NDA or licensing agreement is necessary for Neon to provide support for your extension

Please keep in mind that certain restrictions may apply with respect to Postgres privileges and local file system access. Neon features such as Autoscaling and Auto-suspend may limit the types of extensions we can support.

Depending on the nature of your extension, Neon may also request a liability waiver.

This topic describes migrating data from another Postgres database to Neon using the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` command line utilities.

Repeat the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` process for each database you want to migrate.

## Before you begin

- Neon supports PostgreSQL 14, 15, and 16. We recommend that clients are the same version as source Postgres instance. To check the version of `pg_dump` or `pg_restore`, use the `-V` option. For example: `pg_dump -V`
- Retrieve the connection parameters or connection string for your source Postgres database. The instructions below use a [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING), but you can use the connection format you prefer. If you are logged in to a local Postgres instance, you may only need to provide the database name. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for information about connection parameters.
- Optionally, create a role in Neon to perform the restore operation. The role that performs the restore operation becomes the owner of restored database objects. For example, if you want role `sally` to own database objects, create `role` sally in Neon and perform the restore operation as `sally`.
- If you have assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, read [Database object ownership considerations](#database-object-ownership-considerations). You may want to add the `-O, --no-owner` option to your `pg_restore` command to avoid errors.
- Create the target database in Neon. For example, if you are migrating a database named `pagila`, create a database named `pagila` in Neon. For instructions, see [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).
- Retrieve the connection string for your Neon database. You can find it in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. It will look something like this:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

- Consider running a test migration first to ensure your actual migration goes smoothly. See [Run a test migration](#run-a-test-migration).
- If your database is small, you can pipe `pg_dump` output directly to `pg_restore` to save time. See [Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore](#pipe-pg_dump-to-pg_restore).

## Export data with pg_dump

Export your data from the source database with `pg_dump`:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
pg_dump -Fc -v -d <source_database_connection_string> -f <dump_file_name> 
```

</CodeBlock>

The `pg_dump` command above includes these arguments:

- `-Fc`: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into `pg_restore`.
- `-v`: Runs `pg_dump` in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the dump operation.
- `-d`: Specifies the source database name or [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
- `-f`: The dump file name. It can be any name you choose (`mydumpfile.bak`, for example).

For more command options, see [Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options](#advanced-pg_dump-and-pg_restore-options).

## Restore data to Neon with pg_restore

Restore your data to the target database in Neon with `pg_restore`.

<Admonition type="note">
If you assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, consider adding the `-O, --no-owner` option to your `pg_restore` command to avoid errors. See [Database object ownership considerations](#database-object-ownership-considerations).
</Admonition>

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
pg_restore -v -d <neon_database_connection_string> <dump_file_name>
```

</CodeBlock>

The example above includes these arguments:

- `-v`: Runs `pg_restore` in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the restore operation.
- `-d`: Specifies the Neon database to connect to. The value is a Neon database connection string. See [Before you begin](#before-you-begin).
- `<dump_file_name>` is the name of the dump file you created with `pg_dump`.

For more command options, see [Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options](#advanced-pg_dump-and-pg_restore-options).

## pg_dump and pg_restore example

The following example shows how data from a `pagila` source database is dumped and restored to a `pagila` database in Neon using the commands described in the previous sections. (A database named `pagila` was created in Neon prior to running the restore operation.)

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
~$ cd mydump
~/mydump$ pg_dump -Fc -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila -f mydumpfile.bak 

~/mydump$ ls
mydumpfile.bak

~/mydump$ pg_restore -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila mydumpfile.bak
```

</CodeBlock>

## Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore

For small databases, the standard output of `pg_dump` can be piped directly into a `pg_restore` command to minimize migration downtime:

```bash
pg_dump [args] | pg_restore [args]
```

For example:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
pg_dump -Fc -v -d <source_database_connection_string> | pg_restore -v -d <neon-database-connection-string>
```

</CodeBlock>

Piping is not recommended for large databases, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy migration operations.

When piping `pg_dump` output directly to `pg_restore`, the custom output format (`-Fc`) is most efficient. The directory format (`-Fd`) format cannot be piped to `pg_restore`.

## Post-migration steps

After migrating your data, update your applications to connect to your new database in Neon. You will need the database connection string that you used in your `pg_restore` command. If you run into any problems, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app). After connecting your applications, test them thoroughly to ensure they function correctly with your new database.

## Database object ownership considerations

Roles created in the Neon console, including the default role created with your Neon project, are automatically granted membership in the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#neon_superuser) role. This role can create roles and databases, select from all tables and views, and insert, update, or delete data in all tables. However, the `neon_superuser` is not a PostgreSQL `superuser`. It cannot run `ALTER OWNER` statements to grant ownership of database objects. As a result, if you granted ownership of database objects in your source database to different roles, your dump file will contain `ALTER OWNER` statements, and those statements will cause non-fatal errors when you restore data to your Neon database.

<Admonition type="note">
Regardless of `ALTER OWNER` statement errors, a restore operation still succeeds because assigning ownership is not necessary for the data itself to be restored. The restore operation will still create tables, import data, and create other objects.
</Admonition>

To avoid the non-fatal errors, you can ignore database object ownership statements when restoring data by specifying the `-O, --no-owner` option in your `pg_restore` command:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
pg_restore -v -O -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila mydumpfile.bak 
```

</CodeBlock>

The Neon role performing the restore operation becomes the owner of all database objects.

## Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options

The `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands provide numerous advanced options, some of which are described below. Full descriptions and more options are found in the PostgreSQL [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) documentation.

### pg_dump options

- `-Z`: Defines the compression level to use when using a compressible format. 0 means no compression, while 9 means maximum compression. In general, we recommend a setting of 1. A higher compression level slows the dump and restore process but also uses less disk space.
- `--lock-wait-timeout=20s`: Error out early in the dump process instead of waiting for an unknown amount of time if there is lock contention.
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump. Instead fail if unable to lock a table within the specified timeout.`
- `-j <njobs>`: Consider this option for large databases to dump tables in parallel. Set `<njobs>` to the number of available CPUs. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only make sense for Neon Pro Plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU.
- `--no-blobs`: Excludes large objects from your dump. See [Data migration notes](#data-migration-notes).

### pg_restore options

- `-c --if-exists`: Drop database objects before creating them if they already exist. If you had a failed migration, you can use these options to drop objects created by the previous migration to avoid errors when retrying the migration.
- `-j <njobs>`: Consider this option for large databases to run the restore process in parallel. Set `<njobs>` to the number of available vCPUs. Refer to the [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only makes sense for Neon Pro Plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU. It cannot be used together with `--single-transaction`.
- `--single-transaction`: Forces the operation to run as an atomic transaction, which ensures that no data is left behind when a restore operation fails. Retrying an import operation after a failed attempt that leaves data behind may result in "duplicate key value" errors.
- `--no-tablespaces`: Do not output commands to select tablespaces. See [Data migration notes](#data-migration-notes).
- `-t <table_name>`: Allows you to restore individual tables from a custom-format database dump. Individual tables can also be imported from a CSV file. See [Import from CSV](/docs/import/import-from-csv).

## Run a test migration

It is recommended that you run a test migration before migrating your production database. Make sure you can successfully migrate data to the new database and connect to it. Before starting the actual migration, create a database dump and address any issues that show up. In Neon, you can quickly create a test database, obtain the connection string, and delete the database when you are finished with it. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database).

## Other migration options

This section discusses migration options other than `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

### Postgres GUI clients

Some Postgres clients offer backup and restore capabilities. These include [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/backup_and_restore.html) and [phppgadmin](https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/releases), among others. We have not tested migrations using these clients, but if you are uncomfortable using command-line utilities, they may provide an alternative.

### Table-level data migration

Table-level data migration (using CSV files, for example) does not preserve database schemas, constraints, indexes, types, or other database features. You will have to create these separately. Table-level migration is simple but could result in significant downtime depending on the size of your data and the number of tables. For instructions, see [Import data from CSV](/docs/import/import-from-csv).

## Data migration notes

- You can load data using the `psql` utility, but it only supports plain-text SQL dumps, which you should only consider for small datasets or specific use cases. To create a plain-text SQL dump with `pg_dump` utility, leave out the `-F` format option. Plain-text SQL is the default `pg_dump` output format.
- `pg_dumpall` is not supported.
- `pg_dump` with the `-C, --create` option is not supported.
- Some PostgreSQL features, such as tablespaces and large objects, which require access to the local file system are not supported by Neon. To exclude selecting tablespaces, specify the `--no-tablespaces` option with `pg_restore`. To exclude large objects, specify the `--no-blobs` option with `pg_dump`.

title: Import data from another Neon project
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.758Z'
---

This guide describes how to migrate a database from one Neon project to another by piping data from `pg_dump` to `pg_restore`. Use these instructions to:

- Import a database from a Neon project created in one region to a project created in another region.
- Import a database from a Neon project created with one Postgres version to a Neon project created with another Postgres version.

## Important considerations

- **Upgrading the Postgres version**: When upgrading to a new version of Postgres, always test thoroughly before migrating your production systems or applications. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with the changes in the new version of Postgres, especially those affecting compatibility. For information about those changes, please refer to the official Postgres [Release 15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.0/) or [Release 16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html) documentation.
- **Piping considerations**: Piping is not recommended for large datasets, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy migration operations (see [Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore](/docs/import/import-from-postgres#pipe-pgdump-to-pgrestore) for more information). If your dataset is large, we recommend performing the dump and restore as separate operations. For instructions, see [Import data from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).
- **Neon Free Tier project limit**: The Neon Free Tier has a limit of one project per user, which means a Neon Free Tier user cannot have two projects simultaneously. To move your data from a Neon Free Tier project, dump your database first, delete your Neon project, create a new Neon project with the desired region or Postgres version, and import your data into the new project. For the dump and restore procedure, refer to [Import from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres).

## Import data from another project

To import your data from another Neon project:

1. Create a new project with the desired region or Postgres version. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project) for instructions.

2. Create a database with the desired name in your new Neon project. See [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#create-a-database) for instructions.

3. Retrieve the connection strings for the new and existing Neon databases.

   You can obtain the connection strings from the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**. Connections strings have this format:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

4. Prepare your import command to pipe data to from one Neon project to the other. The command will look similar to this:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   pg_dump -Fc -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname] | pg_restore -v -d postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

   The command includes these arguments:

   - `-Fc`: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into `pg_restore`.
   - `-v`: Runs commands in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the operation.
   - `-d`: Specifies the database name or connection string.

5. Run the command from your terminal or command window.
6. If you no longer require the old project, you can remove it. See [Delete a project](/docs/manage/projects#delete-a-project) for instructions.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.757Z'
---

This topic describes how to import data into a Neon database table from a CSV file.

The instructions require a working installation of [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). The `psql` client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres. For more information about `psql`, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

The following example uses the ready-to-use `neondb` database that is created with your Neon project, a table named `customer`, and a data file named `customer.csv`. Data is loaded from the `customer.csv` file into the `customer` table.

1. Connect to the `neondb` database using `psql`. For example:

   <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

   ```bash
   psql postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

   <Admonition type="note">
   For more information about connecting to Neon with `psql`, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).
   </Admonition>

2. Create the `customer` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE customer (
     id SERIAL,
     first_name VARCHAR(50),
     last_name VARCHAR(50),
     email VARCHAR(255),
     PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   ```

   <Admonition type="tip">
   You can also create tables using the **SQL Editor** in the Neon Console. See [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).
   </Admonition>

3. Prepare a `customer.csv` file with the following data:

   ```text
   First Name,Last Name,Email
   1,Casey,Smith,casey.smith@example.com
   2,Sally,Jones,sally.jones@example.com
   ```

4. From your `psql` prompt, load the data from the `customer.csv` file using the `\copy` option.

   ```bash
   \copy customer FROM '/path/to/customer.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
   ```

   If the command runs successfully, it returns the number of records copied to the database:

   ```bash
   COPY 2
   ```

   For more information about the `\copy` option, refer to the [psql reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

This guide describes how to import your data from Heroku Postgres to Neon.

The instructions assume that you have installed the Heroku CLI, which is used to transfer data from Heroku. For installation instructions, see [The Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

To migrate your data from Heroku to Neon:

1. [Create a Neon project and copy the connection string](#create-a-neon-project-and-copy-the-connection-string)
2. [Retrieve your Heroku app name and database name](#retrieve-your-heroku-app-name-and-database-name)
3. [Import your data](#import-your-data)
4. [Verify that your data was imported](#verify-that-your-data-was-imported)

## Create a Neon project and copy the connection string

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.
4. After creating a project, you are directed to the Neon **Dashboard**, where a connection string with your password is provided under **Connection Details**. Copy the connection string. It is required to import your data from Heroku.

    The example connection string used the instructions that follow is:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

# Migrate data with AWS DMS

---
title: Migrate with AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-27T16:33:52.719Z'
---

This guide outlines the steps for using the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate data to Neon from another hosted database server. AWS DMS supports a variety of database migration sources including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. For a complete list of data migration sources supported by AWS DMS, see [Source endpoints for data migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Introduction.Sources.html#CHAP_Introduction.Sources.DataMigration).

For additional information about particular steps in the migration process, refer to the [official AWS DMS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). If you are not familiar with AWS DMS, we recommend stepping through the [Getting started with AWS Database Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html) tutorial.

If you encounter problems with AWS DMS that are not related to defining Neon as a data migration target endpoint, please contact [AWS Customer Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

This guide uses the [AWS DMS sample Postgres database](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-database-migration-samples/blob/master/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/README.md) for which the schema name is `dms_sample`.

## Before you begin

Complete the following steps before you begin:

- Create a [replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Creating.html) in AWS DMS.
- Configure a [source database endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.html) in AWS DMS.
- Set up a Neon project and a target database. See [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project), and [Create a database](/docs/manage/databases#delete-a-database) for instructions.
- If you are migrating from a database other than Postgres, use the [Schema Conversion Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.SCT.html) or [DMS Schema Conversion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to convert and export the schema from the source database to the target database. Perform this step after creating the target endpoint for the Neon database but before the data migration. If migrating from a Postgres database, schema conversion is not required.

## Create a target endpoint for your Neon database

1. In the AWS Console, select **Database Migration Service**.
2. Select **Endpoints** from the sidebar.
3. Click **Create endpoint**.
4. Select **Target endpoint** as the **Endpoint type**.
5. Provide an **Endpoint identifier** label for your new target endpoint. In this guide, we use `neon` as the identifier.
6. In the **Target engine** drop-down menu, select `PostgreSQL`.
7. Under **Access to endpoint database**, select **Provide access information manually** and enter the information outlined below. You can obtain the connection details from your Neon connection string, which you can find in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. Your  connection string will look similar to this: `postgres://daniel:AbC123dEf@ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb"`.

    - **Server name**: Specify your Neon hostname, which is this portion of your connection string: `ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
    - **Port**: `5432`
    - **User name**: Specify the Neon user.
    - **Password**: Specify the password in the following format: `endpoint=[endpoint_id]$[password]`, which looks similar to this when defined:

      ```text
      endpoint=ep-curly-term-54009904$AbC123dEf
      ```

      You can obtain the `endpoint_id` and password from your Neon connection string. The `endpoint_id` appears similar to this: `ep-curly-term-54009904`. For information about why this password format is required, see [Connection errors](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#the-endpoint-id-is-not-specified). AWS DMS requires the [Option D workaround](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connection-errors#d-specify-the-endpoint-id-in-the-password-field).

    - **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mode**: Select `require`.
    - **Database name**: The name of your Neon database. In this example, we use a database named `neondb`

      When finished, your target endpoint configuration should look similar to this:
      ![Endpoint configuration dialog](/docs/import/endpoint_configuration.png)

9. Under **Test endpoint connection (optional)**, click **Run test** to test the connection. Running the test creates the endpoint and attempts to connect to it. If the connection fails, you can edit the endpoint definition and test the connection again.
10. Select **Create endpoint**.

## Create a database migration task

A database migration task defines the data to be migrated from the source database to the target database.

1. In AWS DMS, select **Database migration tasks** from the sidebar.
2. Select **Create task** to open a **Create database migration task** page.
3. Enter a **Task identifier** to identify the replication task. In this example, we name the identifier `dms-task`.
4. Select the **Replication instance**. In this guide, the replication instance is named `dms_instance`.
5. Select the **Source database endpoint**. In this guide, the replication instance is named `dms_postgresql`.
5. Select the **Target database endpoint**. In this guide, the target database endpoint identifier is `neon`.  
6. Select a **Migration type**. In this example, we use the default `Migrate existing data` type.
![DMS database migration task configuration](/docs/import/dms_task_configuration.png)

### Task settings

Specify the following task settings:

1. For **Editing mode**, select **Wizard**.
2. For Target table preparation mode, select **Do nothing**. This option means that AWS DMS only creates tables in the target database if they do not exist.
3. For the **LOB column** setting, select **Don't include LOB columns**. Neon does not support LOB columns.
4. Optionally, under **Validation**, check **Turn on** to compare the data after the load operation finishes to ensure that data was migrated accurately. For more information about validation, refer to the [AWS data validation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Validating.html).

You can also check **Enable CloudWatch logs** and set **Target Load** to **Debug** or **Detailed debug** to log information during the migration process. This data is useful for troubleshooting migration issues.
![DMS database migration task settings](/docs/import/dms_task_settings.png)

### Table mappings

Configure the table mapping:

1. For **Editing mode**, select **Wizard**.
2. Under **Selection rules**, click **Add new selection rule**.
3. For **Schema**, select **Enter a schema**.
4. For **Source name**, enter the name of your database schema. In this guide, `dms_sample` is specified as the schema name, which is the schema for the sample database. The `dms_sample` schema will be created in your Neon database, and all database objects will be created in the schema.
5. For the **Source table name**, leave the `%` wildcard character to load all tables in the schema.
6. For **Action**, select **Include** to migrate the objects specified by your selection rule.
![DMS database migration task table mappings](/docs/import/dms_task_table_mappings.png)

### Migration task startup configuration

1. Under ***Migration task startup configuration**, select **Automatically on create**.
2. Click **Start migration task** at the bottom of the page. The data migration task is created, and the data migration operation is initiated. You can monitor operation progress on the AWS DMS **Database migrations tasks** page.
![DMS database migration task status](/docs/import/dms_migration_status.png)

## Verify the migration in Neon

To verify that data was migrated to your Neon database:

1. In the Neon Console, select your Neon project.
2. Select **Tables** from the side bar.
3. Select the **Branch**, **Database**, and **Schema** where you imported the data.
![Neon Tables view showing imported data](/docs/import/dms_neon_table_data.png).

## Migration notes

This section contains notes from our experience using AWS DMS to migrate data to Neon from an RDS Postgres database.

- When testing migration steps, the the [Getting started with AWS Database Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.html) tutorial was our primary reference. As recommended in the tutorial, we created a VPC and created all resources within the VPC.
- We created all resources in the same region (`us-east-2a`)
- We created an RDS PostgreSQL 15 database called `dms_sample` as the source database. The Neon target database was also Postgres 15.
- We populated the RDS PostgreSQL source database using the [AWS DMS sample Postgres database](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-database-migration-samples/blob/master/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/README.md). To do this, we created an EC2 instance to connect to the database following the steps in this topic: [Create an Amazon EC2 Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_GettingStarted.Prerequisites.html#CHAP_GettingStarted.Prerequisites.client).
- The source database was populated using this `psql` command:

  <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

  ```bash
  psql -h dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U postgres -d dms_sample -a -f ~/aws-database-migration-samples/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/postgresql.sql
  ```

  </CodeBlock>

- To verify that data was loaded in the source database, we connected using the following `psql` command and ran a `SELECT` query:

    ```bash
    psql \
    --host=dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com \
    --port=5432 \
    --username=postgres \
    --password \
    --dbname=dms_sample


    dms_sample=> SELECT * from dms_sample.player LIMIT 100;
    ```

- When creating the source database endpoint for the RDS Postgres 15 database, we set **Secure Socket Layer (SSL) mode** to `require`. Without this setting, we encountered the following error:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    Test Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Failed to connect Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.0.1.135", user "postgres", database "dms_sample", no encryption
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

- When creating the target database endpoint for the Neon database, we encountered the following error when testing the connection:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```text
    Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Cannot connect to ODBC provider Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: timeout expired
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    The replication instance, which was created in the private subnet where the source database resided, could not access the Neon database, which resides outside of the VPC. To allow the replication instance to access the Neon database, we added a NAT Gateway to the public subnet, allocated an Elastic IP address, and modified the **Route Table** associated with the private subnet to add a route via the NAT Gateway.


# Sample data

subtitle: 'Download sample data for learning, testing, and exploring Neon'
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-11-24T11:25:06.758Z'
---

This guide describes how to download and install sample data for use with Neon.

## Prerequisites

- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) for downloading datasets, unless otherwise instructed. If your system does not support `wget`, you can paste the source file address in your browser's address bar.
- A `psql` client for connecting to your Neon database and loading data. This client is included with a standalone PostgreSQL installation. See [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- A `pg_restore` client if you are loading the [employees](#employees-database) or [postgres_air](#postgres-air-database) database. The `pg_restore` client is included with a standalone PostgreSQL installation. See [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- A Neon database connection string. After creating a database, you can obtain the connection string from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. In the instructions that follow, replace `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]` with your connection string.
- A Neon [Pro](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account if you intend to install a dataset larger than 3 GB.
- Instructions for each dataset require that you create a database. You can do so from a client such as `psql` or from the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor).

## Sample data

Sample datasets are listed in order of the smallest to largest installed size. Please be aware that the Neon Free Tier has a storage limit of 3 GB per branch. Datasets larger than 3 GB cannot be loaded on the Free Tier.

At Neon, security is our highest priority. We are committed to implementing best practices and earning the trust of our users. A key aspect of earning this trust is by ensuring that every touchpoint in our system, from connections, to data storage, to our internal processes, adheres to the highest security standards.

## Secure connections

Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties.

Neon supports the `verify-full` SSL mode for client connections, which is the strictest SSL mode provided by PostgreSQL. When set to `verify-full`, a PostgreSQL client verifies that the server's certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), and that the server host name matches the name stored in the certificate. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. For information about configuring `verify-full` SSL mode for your connections, see [Connect securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).

In addition, Neon requires a 60-bit entropy password for all PostgreSQL roles. This degree of entropy ensures that passwords have a high level of randomness. Assuming a perfect distribution of choices for every bit of entropy, a password with 60 bits of entropy has 2^60 (or about 1.15 quintillion) possible combinations, which makes it computationally infeasible for attackers to guess the password through brute-force methods. For Neon users created via the Neon Console, API, and CLI, passwords are generated with 60-bit entropy. For SQL users created via SQL, user-defined passwords are validated at user-creation time to ensure 60-bit entropy.

## IP allowlist support

Neon's IP Allow feature, available with the [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan), ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with [CIDR notation](/docs/reference/glossary#cidr-notation). To learn more, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## Data-at-rest encryption

Data-at-rest encryption is a method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in [NVMe SSD volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes). The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an `XTS-AES-256` block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.

## Secure data centers

Neonâs infrastructure is hosted and managed within Amazonâs secure data centers backed by [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). Amazon continually manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to ensure compliance with industry standards. For information about AWS data center compliance programs, refer to [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).

## SOC 2 compliance

Neon has successfully completed SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 audits. For more information, see [SOC 2 compliance](soc2-compliance).

## Security reporting

Neon adheres to the [securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/) standard for transparent and efficient security reporting. For details on how to report potential vulnerabilities, please visit our [Security reporting](/docs/security/security-reporting) page or refer to our [security.txt](https://neon.tech/security.txt) file.

| [-v, --version](#version)   | Show the Neon CLI version number                 | boolean| -                                 |
| [-h, --help](#help)      | Show the Neon CLI help                           | boolean| -                                 |

- <a id="output"></a>`-o, --output`

  Sets the output format. Supported options are `json`, `yaml`, and `table`. The default is `table`. Table output may be limited. The `json` and `yaml` output formats show all data.

  ```bash
  neonctl me --output json
  ```

- <a id="config-dir"></a>`--config-dir`

  Specifies the path to the `neonctl` configuration directory. To view the default configuration directory containing you `credentials.json` file, run `neonctl --help`. The credentials file is created when you authenticate using the `neonctl auth` command. This option is only necessary if you move your `neonctl` configuration file to a location other than the default.

  ```bash
  neonctl projects list --config-dir /home/<user>/.config/neonctl
  ```

- <a id="api-key"></a>`--api-key`

  Specifies your Neon API key. You can authenticate using a Neon API key when running a Neon CLI command instead of using `neonctl auth`. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

  ```bash
  neonctl <command> --api-key <neon_api_key>
  ```

  To avoid including the `--api-key` option with each CLI command, you can export your API key to the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable.

  ```bash
  export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
  ```
  
  <Admonition type="info">
  The authentication flow for the Neon CLI follows this order:

  - If the `--api-key` option is provided, it is used for authentication.
  - If the `--api-key` option is not provided, the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting is used.
  - If there is no `--api-key` option or `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting, the CLI looks for the `credentials.json` file created by the `neonctl auth` command.
  - If the credentials file is not found, the Neon CLI initiates the `neonctl auth` web authentication process.
  </Admonition>
  
- <a id="analytics"></a>`--analytics`

  Analytics are enabled by default to gather information about the CLI commands and options that are used by our customers. This data collection assists in offering support, and allows for a better understanding of typical usage patterns so that we can improve user experience. Neon does not collect user-defined data, such as project IDs or command payloads. To opt-out of analytics data collection, specify `--no-analytics` or `--analytics false`.

- <a id="version"></a>`-v, --version`

  Shows the Neon CLI version number.

  ```bash
  $ neonctl --version
  1.15.0
  ```

- <a id="help"></a>`-h, --help`

  Shows the `neonctl` command-line help. You can view help for `neonctl`, a `neonctl` command, or a `neonctl` subcommand, as shown in the following examples:

### Upgrade

When a new version is released, you can update your Neon CLI using the installation methods described above. To check for the latest version, refer to the **Releases** information on the [Neon CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl) page. To check your installed Neon CLI version, run the folliowing command:

```bash
neonctl --version
```

## Connect

The Neon CLI supports connecting via web authentication or API key.

### Web authentication

Run the following command to connect to Neon via web authentication:

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. If you have not authenticated previously, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the web authentication process unless you have specified an API key.

### API key

To authenticate with a Neon API key, you can specify the `--api-key` option when running a Neon CLI command. For example, the following `neonctl projects list` command authenticates to Neon using the `--api-key` option:

```bash
neonctl projects list --api-key <neon_api_key>
```

To avoid including the `--api-key` option with each CLI command, you can export your API key to the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export NEON_API_KEY=<neon_api_key>
```

For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see [Create an API key](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

## Configure autocompletion

The Neon CLI supports autocompletion, which you can configure in a few easy steps. See [Neon CLI commands â completion](/docs/reference/cli-completion) for instructions.

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-01T19:05:09.472Z'
---

## Before you begin

Before running the `auth` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).

## The `auth` command

Authenticates the user or caller to Neon.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl auth
```

The command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account. After granting permissions to the Neon CLI, your credentials are saved locally to a configuration file named `credentials.json`, enabling you manage your account's projects from the command line.

```text
/home/<home>/.config/neonctl/credentials.json
```

An alternative to authenticating using `neon auth` is to provide an API key when running a CLI command. You can do this using the global `--api-key` option or by setting the `NEON_API_KEY` variable. See [Global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options) for instructions.

<Admonition type="info">
The authentication flow for the Neon CLI follows this order:

- If the `--api-key` option is provided, it is used for authentication.
- If the `--api-key` option is not provided, the `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting is used.
- If there is no `--api-key` option or `NEON_API_KEY` environment variable setting, the CLI looks for the `credentials.json` file created by the `neonctl auth` command.
- If the credentials file is not found, the Neon CLI initiates the `neonctl auth` web authentication process.

    <Admonition type="tip">
    The Neon CLI provides a `neonctl connection-string` command you can use to extract a connection uri programmatically. See [Neon CLI commands â connection-string](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).
    </Admonition>

- Create a project with the `--output` format of the command set to `json`. This output format returns all of the project response data, whereas the default `table` output format (shown in the preceding example) is limited in the information it can display.

title: Neon CLI commands â branches
subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-07T19:06:47.674Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `branches` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## The `branches` command

The `branches` command allows you to list, create, rename, delete, and retrieve information about branches in your Neon project. It also permits setting a branch as the primary branch and adding a compute endpoint to a branch. You can create a [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) by adding a read-only compute endpoint.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches <subcommand> [options]
```

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List branches    |
| [create](#create)  | Create a branch |
| [reset](#reset)   | Reset data to parent
| [rename](#rename)   | Rename a branch |
| [set-primary](#set-primary)   | Set a primary branch |
| [add-compute](#add-compute)   | Add replica to a branch |
| [delete](#delete)  | Delete a branch |
| [get](#get)     | Get a branch    |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list branches in a Neon project.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `list` subcommand supports this option:

| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--project-id` | Project ID    | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |

#### Examples

- List branches with the default `table` output format. The information provided with this output format is limited compared to other formats, such as `json`.

    ```bash
    neonctl branches list --project-id solitary-leaf-288182
    ââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââ

### create

This subcommand allows you to create a branch in a Neon project.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches create [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `create` subcommand supports these options:

| Option    | Description                                                    | Type    |   Required  |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :---------: |
| `--project-id` | Project ID    | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| `--name`    | The branch name                                                | string  |             |
| `--parent`  | Parent branch name, id, timestamp, or LSN. Defaults to the primary branch | string  |             |
| `--compute`| Create a branch with or without a compute. By default, the branch is created with a read-write endpoint. The default value is `true`. To create a branch without a compute, use `--no-compute` | boolean |    |
| `--type`| Type of compute to add. Choices are `read_write` (the default) or `read_only`. A branch with a read-only compute endpoint is also referred to as a [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).                                     | string |             |

    <Admonition type="tip">
    The Neon CLI provides a `neonctl connection-string` command you can use to extract a connection uri programmatically. See [Neon CLI commands â connection-string](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/cli-connection-string).

- Create a branch with a user-defined name:

```bash
neonctl branches create --name mybranch
```

- Create a branch with a read-only compute endpoint (a [read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas))

```bash
neonctl branches create --name my_read_replica_branch --type read_only
```

- Create a branch from a parent branch other than your `main` branch

```bash
neonctl branches create --name my_child_branch --parent mybranch
```

- Create a point-in-time restore branch by specifying the `--parent` option with a timestamp:

```bash
neonctl branches create --name data_recovery --parent 2023-07-11T10:00:00Z
```

The timestamp must be provided in ISO 8601 format. You can use this [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/). For more information about point-in-time restore, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore (PITR)](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

### reset

This command resets a child branch to the latest data from its parent.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl branches reset <id|name> --parent
```
`<id|name>` refers to the branch ID or branch name. You can use either one for this operation.

`--parent` specifies the type of reset operation. Currently, Neon only supports reset from parent. This parameter is required for the operation to work. In the future, Neon might add support for other reset types: for example, rewinding a branch to an earlier period in time.

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `reset` subcommand supports this option:

| Option        | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | :-----: |
| --project-id  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project or context is not set|

#### Example

```bash
neonctl branches reset mybranch --parent

subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-01T19:05:09.474Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `databases` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about databases in Neon, see [Manage databases](/docs/manage/databases).

## The `databases` command

### Usage

The `databases` command allows you to list, create, and delete databases in a Neon project.

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List databases    |
| [create](#create)  | Create a database |
| [delete](#delete)  | Delete a database |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list databases.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl databases list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `list` subcommand supports these options:

| Option        | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ | :------: |
| --project-id  | Project ID  | string | Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| --branch   | Branch ID or name   | string |  |

If a branch ID or name is not provided, the command lists databases for the primary branch of the project.

#### Example

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
neonctl databases list --branch br-autumn-dust-190886
ââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââ

title: Neon CLI commands â operations
subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-01T19:05:09.475Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `operations` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about operations in Neon, see [Operations](/docs/manage/operations).

## The `operations` command

The `operations` command allows you to list operations for a Neon project.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl operations <subcommand> [options]
```

| Subcommand  | Description      |
|---------|------------------|
| [list](#list)    | List operations    |

### list

This subcommand allows you to list operations.

#### Usage

```bash
neonctl operations list [options]
```

#### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `list` subcommand supports this option:

| Option       | Description | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------ | :------: |
| --project-id | Project ID  | string |  Only if your Neon account has more than one project |

#### Example

```bash
neonctl operations list 
ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââ¬âââââââââââ¬âââââââââââââââââââââââ

title: Neon CLI commands â connection-string
subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-19T08:49:51.605Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `connection-string` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## The `connection-string` command

This command constructs a Postgres connection string for connecting to a database in your Neon project. You can construct a connection string for any database in any branch. The connection string includes the password for the specified role.

### Usage

```bash
neonctl connection-string [branch] [options]
```

`branch` specifies the branch name or id. If a branch name or ID is ommited, the primary branch is used.

### Options

In addition to the Neon CLI [global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options), the `connect-string` command supports these options:

| Option        | Description  | Type   | Required  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------ | :------: |
| --project-id  | Project ID   | string |  Only if your Neon account has more than one project |
| --role-name   | Role name    | string | Only if your branch has more than one role |
| --database-name| Database name| string | Only if your branch has more than one database |
| --pooled | Construct a pooled connection. The default is `false`. |boolean||
| --prisma | Construct a connection string for use with Prisma. The default is `false`. |boolean||

### Examples

- Generate a basic connection string for the current project, branch, and database:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string mybranch
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

- Generate a pooled connection string for the current project, branch, and database with the `--pooled` option. This option adds a `-pooler` flag to the host name which enables connection pooling for clients that use this connection string.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string --pooled
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

- Generate a connection string for use with Prisma for the current project, branch, and database. The `--prisma` options adds `connect_timeout=30` option to the connection string to ensure that connections from Prisma Client do not timeout.

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    neonctl connection-string --prisma
   postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?connect_timeout=30
    ```

# set-context

title: Neon CLI commands â set-context
subtitle: Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-07T19:06:47.675Z'
---

## Before you begin

- Before running the `set-context` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/neon-cli#install-the-neon-cli).
- If you have not authenticated with the [neonctl auth](/docs/reference/cli-auth) command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the `--api-key` option when running a command. See [Connect](/docs/reference/neon-cli#connect).

## The `set-context` command

This command sets a background context for your CLI sessions, letting you perform project or branch-specific actions without having to specify the project or branch id in every command. Using the `context-file` parameter, you can save the context to a file of your choice. If you don't specify a file, a default `.neon` file is saved to the current directory. You can switch contexts by providing different files.

The context remains in place until you reset to a new context or remove the `context-file`.

### Usage

#### set-context (hidden file)

```bash
neonctl set-context [option]
```
#### set-context to context-file

```bash
neonctl set-context [option] --context-file <your_context_file>
```

#### set-context during project creation

You can also set context for a new project during project creation.

```bash
neonctl projects create --name <project_name> --set-context <your_context_file>
```

### Options

The `set-context` command requires you set at least one of these options:
| Option       | Description   | Type   | Required  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------ | :------: |
| `--project-id` | Project ID    | string | Sets the identified project as the context until you reset or remove context-file |
| `--branch` | Branch ID or name | string | Sets the identified branch as the context until you reset or remove context-file |
| `--context-file` | path and file name | string | Creates a file that holds project-id and branch context 

[Global options](/docs/reference/neon-cli#global-options) are also supported.

## Examples of setting and using a context

Here are some examples of setting contexts to specific projects, then using them in an example command.

### Using the default file

Set the context to the default `.neon` file:
```bash
neonctl set-context --project-id patient-frost-50125040
```
List all branches for this project using `branches list`. You do not need to include `--project-id` even though multiple projects exist for this account:

```bash
neonctl branches list
```
The results show details for all branches in the `patient-frost-50125040` project:

```

<Admonition type="note">
These two `branches list` commands demonstrate the use of different contexts in the same account. The default `.neon` context is set to `patient-frost-50125040` while the named `context-file` is set to `plain-waterfall-84865553`. These contexts operate independently. You can set as many `context-files` as you'd like, using unique names or in different directories, depending on your needs.
</Admonition>

### Setting context when creating a new project

Let's say you want to create a new project called `MyLatest`. You can automatically set the project ID and primary branch ID  context at the same time as you create the project.

```bash
neonctl projects create --name MyLatest --set-context
```

This creates a hidden file with the following context details:

```json
{
  "projectId": "quiet-water-76237589",
  "branchId": "br-still-wind-46531853"
}
```
You can now use any command that would normally require an additional `--project-id` or `branch` parameter and the command will default to this context.

<Admonition type="note">
Neon does not save any confidential information to the context file (for example, auth tokens). You can safely commit this file to your repository or share with others.
</Admonition>

enableTableOfContents: true
updatedOn: '2023-12-01T22:29:21.618Z'
---

## Before you begin

Before running the `completion` command, ensure that you have [installed the Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-install).

## The `completion` command

This command generates a completion script for the `neonctl` command-line interface (CLI). The completion script, when installed, helps you type `neonctl` commands faster and more accurately. It does this by presenting the possible commands and options when you press the **tab** key after typing or partially typing a command or option.

### Usage

```bash

Neon provides support for the [@neondatabase/api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) library, which is a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). It provides a convenient way to interact with the Neon API using TypeScript.

## Installation

You can install the library using `npm` or `yarn`.

`npm`:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

`yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @neondatabase/api-client
```

## Get Started

To get started with the `@neondatabase/api-client` library, follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API key from the [Developer Settings](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) page in the Neon Console.

2. Click **Generate new API key**.

3. Enter name for your API key and click **Create**.

4. Save your API key to a secure location that enables you to pass it to your code.

5. Import the library:

   ```typescript
   import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';
   ```

6. Create an instance of the API client by calling the `createApiClient` function:

    ```typescript
    const apiClient = createApiClient({
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    });
    ```

7. Use the `apiClient` instance to make API calls. For example:

    ```typescript
    const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
    console.log(response);
    ```

## Community SDKs

The following is a list of community-created SDKs for interacting with the Neon API.

## Access token

See [Token](#token).

## Active time

The total amount of time, measured in hours, that your compute resources have been active within a given billing period. This includes all computes in your Neon project, but excludes time when computes are in an `Idle` state due to [auto-suspension](#auto-suspend-compute). The [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) has an [Active time](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) limit of 100 hours per month, but that limit only affects non-primary branch compute usage. Active time on all computes is counted toward the limit, but when the limit is exceeded, only non-primary branch computes are subject to suspension. The primary branch compute always remains available regardless of the limit, ensuring that access to data on the primary branch is never interrupted. Neon Free Tier users can monitor _Active time_ on the **Usage** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. The _Active time_ limit resets at the beginning of each month. For instance, if you enroll in the Neon Free Tier on January 15th, your _Active time_ limit will reset on February 1st.

## Activity Monitor

A process that monitors a Neon compute instance for activity. During periods of inactivity, the Activity Monitor gracefully places the compute into an `Idle` state to save energy and resources. The Activity Monitor closes idle connections after 5 minutes of inactivity. When a connection is made to an idle compute, the Activity Monitor reactivates the compute.

## API

See [Neon API](#neon-api).

## API Key

A unique identifier used to authenticate a user or a calling program to an API. An API key is required to authenticate to the Neon API. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## apply_config

A Neon Control Plane operation that applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating Postgres users and databases initiates this operation. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Auto-suspend compute

A feature that suspends a compute endpoint after a specified period of inactivity (5 minutes, by default) to save on compute resources. This feature is also referred to as "scale to zero". When suspended, a compute endpoint is placed into an `Idle` state. Otherwise, the compute endpoint is in an `Active` state. Neon Pro Plan users can configure the _Auto-suspend_ feature. For example, you can increase the delay period to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable Auto-suspend completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. For more information, see [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

## autoscaler-agent

A control mechanism in the Neon autoscaling system that collects metrics from VMs, makes scaling decisions, and performs checks and requests to implement those decisions.

## Autoscaling

A feature that automatically adjusts the allocation of vCPU and RAM for compute endpoints within specified minimum and maximum compute size boundaries, optimizing for performance and cost-efficiency. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

## Availability Checker

A periodic load generated by the Control Plane to determine if a compute can start and read and write data. The Availability Checker queries a system database without accessing user data.

## Backpressure

A mechanism that manages the lag between the Pageserver and compute node or the Pageserver and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) service. If the WAL service runs ahead of the Pageserver, the time to serve page requests increases, which could result in increased query times or timeout errors. The backpressure mechanism manages lag using a stop-and-wait backend throttling strategy.

<a id="branches-coming-soon/"></a>

## Branch

A [copy-on-write](#copy-on-write) clone of a Neon project's primary branch or previously created child branch. A branch can be created from the current or past state of the parent branch. A branch created from the current state of the parent branch includes the databases and roles that existed in the parent branch at the time of branch creation. A branch created from a past state of the parent branch includes the databases and roles that existed in the past state. The data in a branch can be modified independently from its originating data. See [Branching](/docs/introduction/branching). Connecting to a database in a branch requires connecting via the branch's compute endpoint. For more information, see [Connect to a branch](/docs/manage/branches#connect-to-a-branch).

## Branching

A Neon feature that allows you to create a copy-on-write clone (a "branch") of your project data. See [Branch](#branch).

## check_availability

A Neon Control Plane operation that checks the availability of data in a branch and that a compute endpoint can start on a branch. Branches without a compute endpoint are not checked. This operation, performed by the availability checker, is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## CI/CD

Continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

## CIDR notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method used to define ranges of IP addresses in network management. It is presented in the format of an IP address, followed by a slash, and then a number (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). The number after the slash represents the size of the address block, providing a compact way to specify a large range of IP addresses. In Neon's IP Allow feature, CIDR notation allows for efficiently specifying a block of IP addresses, especially useful for larger networks or subnets. This can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network. For related information, see [Configure IP Allow](/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow).

## cgroups

Control groups, a Linux kernel feature that allows the organization, prioritization, and accounting of system resources for groups of processes.

## Compute

A service that provides virtualized computing resources (CPU, memory, and storage) for running applications. A Neon compute instance (also referred to as a [compute endpoint](#compute-endpoint)) runs Postgres. The amount of compute resources available to a Neon project is defined by tier. Neon supports free and paid tiers.

## Compute endpoint

A Neon compute instance. Neon creates a single read-write compute endpoint for the project's primary branch. Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints. You can choose whether or not to create a compute endpoint when creating child branches. The compute endpoint hostname is required to connect to a Neon database from a client or application. A compute endpoint hostname can be found in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard** or by selecting the branch on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console. A compute endpoint hostname starts with an `ep-` prefix, as in this example: `ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`. A compute endpoint hostname includes an `endpoint_id` (`ep-cool-darkness-123456`), a region slug (`us-east-2`), the cloud platform (`aws`), and Neon domain (`neon.tech`). For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app). For more information about compute endpoints, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints/).

## Connection pooling

A method of creating a pool of connections and caching those connections for reuse. Neon supports `PgBouncer` inÂ `transaction mode` for connection pooling. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).

## Connection string

A string containing details for connecting to a Neon database. The details include a user name (role), compute endpoint hostname, and database name; for example:

<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```terminal
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

</CodeBlock>

The compute endpoint hostname includes an `endpoint_id` (`ep-cool-darkness-123456`), a region slug (`us-east-2`), the cloud platform (`aws`), and Neon domain (`neon.tech`).

Connection strings for a Neon databases can be obtained from the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For information about connecting to Neon, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Compute size

The number of Compute Units (CU) assigned to a Neon compute. One CU is defined as having 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute.

## Compute Unit (CU)

A unit that measures the processing power of a Neon compute. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs.

## Compute time

A billing metric that measures the amount of computing capacity used within a given billing period. See [Compute time](/docs/introduction/billing#comput-time).

## Console

See [Neon Console](#neon-console).

## Control Plane

The part of the Neon architecture that manages cloud storage and compute resources.

## Copy-on-write

A technique used to copy data efficiently. Neon uses the copy-on-write technique to copy data when creating a branch.

## create_branch

A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a branch in a Neon project. For related information, see Manage branches. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## create_timeline

A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a project with a primary branch. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Data-at-rest encryption

A method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in [NVMe SSD volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes). The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.

## Data transfer

A billing metric that measures the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (known as "egress") during a given billing period. See [Data transfer](/docs/introduction/billing#data-transfer).

## Database

A named collection of database objects. A Neon project has a ready-to-use database named `neondb` which resides in the default `public` schema. A Neon project can contain multiple databases. Users cannot manipulate system databases, such as the `postgres`, `template0`, or `template1` databases.

## Database branching

See [Branching](#branching).

## Database fleet

A collection of database instances, typically managed as a single entity.

## Decoder plugin

Utilized in PostgreSQL replication architecture to decode WAL entries into a format understandable by the subscriber. The `pgoutput` decoder plugin is the default decoder, with alternatives like `wal2json` for specific use cases. Neon supports `pgoutput` and `wal2json`. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## Dedicated resources

Resources including compute and storage dedicated to a single Neon account.

## delete_tenant

A Neon Control Plane operation that deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information.

## Egress

The data transferred out of the Neon service to an external destination.

## Enterprise plan

A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Free Tier

See [Neon Free Tier](#neon-free-tier).

## IP allowlist

An IP allowlist is a security measure used in network and database management. It specifies a list of IP addresses that are permitted to access a certain resource. Any IP address not on the list is automatically blocked, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can gain access. In Neon, **IP Allow** is a [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature that can be used to control access to the branch where your database resides. The allowlist can be applied to all branches (the default) or the [primary branch](#primary-branch) only. For more information, see [Configure the IP Allow list](/docs/manage/projects#configure-tip-allow).

## Kubernetes

An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes cluster

A set of interconnected nodes that run containerized applications and services using Kubernetes, an open-source orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The cluster consists of at least one control plane node, which manages the overall state of the cluster, and multiple worker nodes, where the actual application containers are deployed and executed. The worker nodes communicate with the control plane node to ensure the desired state of the applications is maintained.

## Kubernetes node

A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which runs containerized applications.

## Kubernetes scheduler

A component of Kubernetes that assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

## KVM

Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a virtualization infrastructure built into the Linux kernel that allows it to act as a hypervisor for virtual machines.

## Live migration

A feature provided by some hypervisors, such as QEMU, that allows the transfer of a running virtual machine from one host to another with minimal interruption.

## Local File Cache

A layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data from the storage layer in the local memory of the compute instance. This cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the storage layer repeatedly.

## Logical replication

A method of replicating data between databases or platforms, focusing on replicating transactional changes (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) rather than the entire database, enabling selective replication of specific tables or rows. Neon supports logical replication of data to external destinations. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

## LSN

Log Sequence Number. A byte offset to a location in the [WAL stream](#wal-stream). The Neon branching feature supports creating branches with data up to a specified LSN.

## LRU policy

Least Recently Used policy, an algorithm for cache replacement that evicts the least recently accessed items first.

## Neon

A fully managed serverless Postgres. Neon separates storage and compute to offer modern developer features such as branching, autoscaling, and bottomless storage. For more information, see [What is Neon?](/docs/introduction/about/).

## Neon API

The Neon RESTful Application Programming Interface. Any operation performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API.

## Neon Console

A browser-based graphical interface for managing Neon projects and resources.

## Neon Free Tier

A Neon service tier for which there are no usage charges. For information about the Neon Free Tier and associated limits, see [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

## Neon Pro Plan

A usage-based paid plan offered by Neon. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Neon user

The user account that registers and authenticates with Neon using an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account. After authenticating, a Neon user account can create and manage projects, branches, users, databases, and other project resources.

## NeonVM

A QEMU-based tool used by Neon to create and manage VMs within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing for the allocation and deallocation of vCPU and RAM. For more information, refer to the NeonVM source in the [neondatabase/autoscaling](https://github.com/neondatabase/autoscaling/tree/main/neonvm) repository.

## Non-primary branch

Any branch not designated as the [primary branch](#primary-branch) is considered a non-primary branch. For more information, see [Non-primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch).

## Page

An 8KB unit of data, which is the smallest unit that Postgres uses for storing relations and indexes on disk. In Neon, a page is also the smallest unit of data that resides on a Pageserver. For information about Postgres page format, see [Database Page Layout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/storage-page-layout.html), in the _PostgreSQL Documentation_.

## Paid plan

 A paid Neon service tier. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Pageserver

A Neon architecture component that reads WAL records from Safekeepers to identify modified pages. The Pageserver accumulates and indexes incoming WAL records in memory and writes them to disk in batches. Each batch is written to an immutable file that is never modified after creation. Using these files, the Pageserver can quickly reconstruct any version of a page dating back to the defined history retention period. Neon retains a history for all branches. The default history retention period is 7 days.

The Pageserver uploads immutable files to cloud storage, which is the final, highly durable destination for data. After a file is successfully uploaded to cloud storage, the corresponding WAL records can be removed from the Safekeepers.

## Passwordless authentication

The ability to authenticate without providing a password. Neonâs [Passwordless auth](#passwordless-auth) feature supports passwordless authentication.

## Platform Partnership plan

A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon that includes support for resale. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans).

## Point-in-time restore

Restoration of data to a state that existed at an earlier time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records, which allows you to restore data to an earlier time. A point-in-time restore is performed by creating a branch using the **Time** or **LSN** option. By default, Neon retains a 7-day history of changes for all branches in a project. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Neon Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. For more information about this feature, see [Branching â Point-in-time restore](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

## PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

## Postgres role

A Postgres role named for the registered Neon account is created with each Neon project. This role and any additional role created in the Neon Console, API, or CLI is assigned the [neon_superuser](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role) role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, sequences. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic [public schema privileges](/docs/manage/database-access#public-schema-privileges) granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the `neon_superuser` role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see [Manage database access](/docs/manage/database-access).

Older projects may have a `web-access` system role, used by the [SQL Editor](#sql-editor) and Neonâs [Passwordless auth](#passwordless-auth). The `web-access` role is system-managed. It cannot be modified, removed, or used in other authentication scenarios.

## Primary branch

Each Neon project is created with a primary branch called `main`, but you can designate any branch as your project's primary branch. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch. For more information, see [Primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch).

### Pro Plan

See [Neon Pro Plan](#neon-pro-plan).

## Project

A collection of branches, databases, roles, and other project resources and settings. A project contains a compute with a Postgres server and storage for the project data.

## Project sharing

A feature that allows you to share Neon projects with other Neon users. See [Share a project](/docs/manage/projects#share-a-project) for more information.

## Project storage

The total volume of data stored in your Neon project. Also, a billing metric that measures the total volume of data and history, in GiB-hours, stored in your Neon project. See [Project storage](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

## Proxy

A Neon component that functions as a multitenant service that accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol.

## Publisher

In the context of logical replication, the publisher is the primary data source where changes occur. It's responsible for sending those changes to one or more subscribers. A Neon database can act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

## QEMU

A free and open-source emulator and virtualizer that performs hardware virtualization.

## RAM

Random Access Memory, a type of computer memory used to store data that is being actively processed.

## Region

The geographic location where Neon project resources are located. Neon supports creating projects in several Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions. For information about regions supported by Neon, see [Regions](/docs/introduction/regions).

## Replication slot

On the publisher database in a logical replication setup, replication slots track the progress of replication to ensure no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it, thus preventing data loss or inconsistency. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## Resale

Selling the Neon service as part of another service offering. Neon's Platform Partnership plan offers resale of the Neon service as an option. See [Neon plans](/docs/introduction/plans) for more information.

## Safekeeper

A Neon architecture component responsible for the durability of database changes. Postgres streams WAL records to Safekeepers. A quorum algorithm based on Paxos ensures that when a transaction is committed, it is stored on a majority of Safekeepers and can be recovered if a node is lost. Safekeepers are deployed in different availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.

## Scale-to-zero

Scale-to-zero refers to Neon's _Auto-suspend compute_ feature, which places a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state when it is not being used. Neon suspends a compute after five minutes of inactivity, by default. See [Auto-suspend compute](#auto-suspend-compute).

## Serverless

A cloud-based development model that enables developing and running applications without having to manage servers.

## SNI

Server Name Indication. A TLS protocol extension that allows a client or browser to indicate which hostname it wants to connect to at the beginning of a TLS handshake.

## SQL Editor

A feature of the Neon Console that enables running queries on a Neon database. The SQL Editor also enables saving queries, viewing query history, and analyzing or explaining queries.

## start_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that starts a compute endpoint when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute endpoint initiates this operation. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## Storage

Where data is recorded and stored. Neon storage consists of Pageservers, which store hot data, and a cloud object store, such as Amazon S3, that stores cold data for cost optimization and durability.

## Subscriber

The database or platform receiving changes from the publisher in a logical replication setup. It applies changes received from the publisher to its own data set. Currently, a Neon database can only act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See [Logical replication](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide). 

## Subscription

Represents the downstream side of logical replication, establishing a connection to the publisher and subscribing to one or more publications to receive updates. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## suspend_compute

A Neon Control Plane operation that suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity. See [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle).

## Technical Preview

Neon is currently in Technical Preview, meaning that some intended core functionalities are still being developed or perfected. Please refer to the [Neon roadmap](/docs/introduction/roadmap) for more information.

## Token

An encrypted access token that enables you to authenticate with Neon using the Neon API. An access token is generated when creating a Neon API key. For more information, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).

## tmpfs

A temporary file storage system that uses a portion of a system's RAM to store files, improving performance by reducing disk usage.

## User

See [Neon user](#neon-user) and [Postgres role](#postgresql-role).

## vm-informant

A program that runs inside the VM alongside Postgres, responsible for requesting more resources from the autoscaler-agent and validating proposed downscaling to ensure sufficient memory.

## vCPU

Virtual CPU, a unit of processing power allocated to a virtual machine or compute instance.

## WAL

See [Write-Ahead Logging](#write-ahead-logging-wal).

## WAL receiver

In logical replication, on the subscriber side, the WAL receiver is a process that receives the replication stream (decoded WAL data) and applies these changes to the subscriber's database. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL sender

In logical replication, the WAL sender is a process on the publisher database that reads the WAL and sends relevant data to the subscriber. See [Postgres logical replication concepts](/docs/guides/logical-replication-concepts).

## WAL slice

Write-ahead logs in a specific LSN range.

## WAL stream

The stream of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during transactional processing.

## Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

A standard mechanism that ensures the durability of your data. Neon relies on WAL to separate storage and compute, and to support features such as branching and point-in-time restore.

In logical replication, the WAL records all changes to the data, serving as the source for data that needs to be replicated.

## Written data

A billing metric that measures the total volume of data written from compute to storage within a given billing period, measured in gigibytes (GiB). Writing data from compute to storage ensures the durability and integrity of your data. See [Written data](/docs/introduction/billing#written-data).


# Postgres compatibility

Neon is protocol and application-compatible with Postgres. However, when using the Neon cloud service, there are some limitations that you should be aware of.

## Postgres versions

Neon cloud service is currently compatible with Postgres 14, 15, and 16. You can select the Postgres version you want to use when creating a Neon project. Postgres 15 is selected, by default. For information about creating a Neon project, See [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).

## Postgres extensions

Neon supports numerous Postgres extensions, and we regularly add support for more. For a list of supported extensions, see [Postgres Extensions](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions). To request support for additional extensions, please post your request to the [Neon community forum](https://community.neon.tech/). [Neon Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can open a support ticket from the console. For more detail, see [Getting Support](/docs/introduction/support).

## Roles and permissions

Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres `superuser` account like you can in a standalone Postgres installation.

Roles created in the Neon console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. For information about the privileges associated with this role, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

Roles created in Neon with SQL syntax, from a command-line tool like `psql` or the [Neon SQL Editor](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor), have the same privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the `neon_superuser` role. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have. For more information, see [Manage roles with SQL](/docs/manage/roles#manage-roles-with-sql).

Neon roles cannot access replication methods or install Postgres extensions other than those supported by Neon.

## Neon Postgres parameter settings

The following table lists Neon Postgres parameter settings that may differ from the expected default.

| Parameter       | Value   | Note                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fsync           | off     | Neon syncs data to the Neon Storage Engine to store your data safely and reliably |
| max_connections |         | The value depends on compute size. Set to 100 for Neon.          |
| shared_buffers  |         | The value depends on compute size                                                 |

<Admonition type="note">
You can use connection pooling in Neon to increase the number of supported connections. For more information, see [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling).
</Admonition>

## Unlogged tables

Unlogged tables are maintained on Neon compute local storage. These tables do not survive compute restarts (including when a Neon compute instance is placed into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity). This is unlike a standalone Postgres installation, where unlogged tables are only truncated in the event of abnormal process termination. Additionally, unlogged tables are limited by compute local storage size.

## Spill and index build handling

Certain queries in Postgres can generate large datasets that do not fit in memory. In such cases, storage spills the data. In Neon, the size of compute local storage limits the ability to create large indexes or execute certain queries that generate large datasets.

## Temporary tables

Temporary tables, which are stored in compute local storage, are limited by compute local storage size.

## Session context

The Neon cloud service automatically closes idle connections after a period of inactivity, as described in [Compute lifecycle](/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/). When connections are closed, anything defined within a session context is forgotten and must be recreated before being used again. For example, temporary tables, prepared statements, advisory locks, and notifications and listeners that were defined using the [NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-notify.html)/[LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-listen.html) commands only exist for the duration of the current session and are lost when the session ends.

## Statistics collection

Statistics collected by the Postgres [cumulative statistics system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/monitoring-stats.html) are currently not saved when the Neon compute node is placed into an `Idle` state due to inactivity or restarted. For information about the lifecycle of a Neon compute, see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/conceptual-guides/compute-lifecycle/).

## Database encoding

Neon does not currently support changing the database encoding. This feature will become available when we add support for creating databases using SQL, which is on our roadmap. Currently, creating a database is supported only in the Neon Console. See [Manage databases](/docs/manage/databases).

## PostgreSQL documentation

Neon provides a mirror of the official PostgreSQL documentation on the [Neon documentation site](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction) for the convenience of our users. As Neon is built on standard PostgreSQL, most information from the official PostgreSQL documentation applies to our platform. However, there are a few key differences to consider when referencing the official PostgreSQL docs:

- As a managed Postgres service, certain aspects of the official PostgreSQL documentation like installation procedures do not apply to Neon.
- Some features detailed in the official PostgreSQL documentation may not be relevant for Neon, such as those mentioned on this Postgres compatibility page.
- Features requiring the PostgreSQL superuser privilege may not be supported. See [Roles and permissions](#roles-and-permissions) above.
- Neon may not support all of the extensions mentioned in the official PostgreSQL documentation. See [Postgres extensions](#postgres-extensions) above.

## Why should you contribute?

Open-source projects are always evolving. Contributing to documentation is a great way for beginners to get started in open source and for experienced developers to explain complex topics while sharing their knowledge with the community.

By contributing to the Neon docs, you're helping us create a stronger learning resource for all developers. Whether you've found a typo, a section that's hard to understand, or you've noticed that a certain topic is missing, your contribution is always welcome and appreciated.

## How to contribute

Documentation source files are located in the [neondatabase/website](https://github.com/neondatabase/website) repository, in the `/content/docs` directory. To contribute, you have two options:

1. Edit files directly on GitHub.
2. Fork the [neondatabase/website](https://github.com/neondatabase/website) repository, create a branch for your changes, and submit a pull request.

If you prefer the first option, which is great for edits and small updates, there is an **Edit this page** link at the bottom of each Neon documentation page.

![GitHub edit this page link](/docs/community/edit_this_page.png)

Clicking the link takes you to the Markdown file in GitHub, where you can click the **Edit this page** icon to make a change. When you finish editing, commit your changes to create a pull request.

If you would rather fork the [neondatabase/website](https://github.com/neondatabase/website) repository and submit a pull request, but you're not familiar with the process, we suggest going through the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request). This guide describes how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request. To help you get started, we provide a [GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/neondatabase/website/blob/main/content/docs/guides/GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md) file, which you can find in the [neondatabase/website](https://github.com/neondatabase/website) repository, under the `/content/docs/guides` directory. After you create a branch, copy the template file and rename it. Don't forget to add your guide to the sidebar. See [Add a new page](#add-a-new-page).

## Markdown

Neon uses Markdown as the documentation source format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It's designed to be easy to read and easy to write.

If you're new to Markdown, GitHub provides an excellent guide to get you started. The [GitHub Markdown Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) covers most of the basic writing and formatting syntax you'll need to contribute to the Neon docs.

## Preview changes in VSCode

At Neon, we use VSCode for writing documentation. VSCode includes a built-in markdown previewer that you can use to view your changes locally.

To use this feature, open the command palette (â + â§ + V on Mac or Ctrl + Shift + V on Windows). This opens a preview window for viewing your changes in formatted Markdown.

## Contribution review process

After you submit a contribution, the Neon documentation team reviews your changes, provides feedback, and merges the pull request when it's ready.

Please reach out on the [Neon Community forum](https://community.neon.tech/) if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## Documentation file structure

The Neon documentation file structure reflects the navigation you see on the website. However, the order of the directories under `/content/docs/` is alphabetical.

```text
âââ content
   âââ docs
       âââ ai
       âââ community
       âââ connect
       âââ extensions
       âââ get-started-with-neon
       âââ guides
       âââ introduction
       âââ manage
       âââ reference
       âââ security
       âââ serverless
```

- Every Markdown file in the `/docs` folder becomes a documentation page unless it's defined with an `isDraft: true` property in the page [frontmatter](#markdown-frontmatter).
- Folder and file names should use [kebab-case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case) (hyphens between words).

## Documentation table of contents

This section describes how to modify the documentation table of contents, also referred to as the "sidebar". Adding, removing, or moving a page in the documentation requires updating the sidebar. The sidebar is defined in a `yaml` file, conveniently named `sidebar.yaml`, which you can find at the root of the `/docs` directory.

### Add a new category

To add a new category to the sidebar, add a new item to the top-level array with `title` and `items` key values, as shown below:

```diff
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
+- title: Category 2
+  items:
+    - title: Page 2
+      slug: page-2
```

### Add a new page

To add new page, add a new item to the `items` array with the `title` and `slug` keys under the category or subcategory.

```diff yaml
 - title: Category 1
   items:
     - title: Page 1
       slug: page-1
 - title: Category 2
   items:
     - title: Page 2
       slug: page-2
    - title: Subcategory 1
      items:
        - title: Page 3
          slug: page-3
+       - title: Page 4
+         slug: page-4
    - title: Page 5
      slug: page-5
```

- The `title` in the sidebar may differ from `title` in the Markdown file. For example, your sidebar title might be a shorter version of the title in your Markdown file. This lets you write longer, more informative page titles while keeping the sidebar titles short, readable, and easy to scan. These titles should remain logically related. For example, in our docs we reduce the page title "Use Grafbase Edge Resolvers with Neon" to just "Grafbase" in the sidebar.
- `slug` should always exactly match the page's slug (the last part of the URL after the final backslash "/", in our case the name of the Markdown file).

## Markdown frontmatter

Each Neon documentation Markdown file includes a frontmatter section at the beginning of the file containing file metadata. The frontmatter section is distinguished by three dashes, as shown here:

```yaml
---
tile: Page Title
enableTableOfContents: true
---
```

The only required attribute is `title`, which becomes the page title that appears on the page and the browser tab.

### Frontmatter attributes

Frontmatter attributes include:

Attribute | Description
----- | ---
subtitle |  A secondary title or description that appears on the page, under the main title.
enableTableOfContents | A boolean flag (i.e., true or false) that tells the static site generator whether or not to generate a right-hand table of contents for the page. We recommend adding this option if your page has more than a few sections.
isDraft | Adding this attribute and setting it to `true` prevents the page from becoming a documentation page and being searchable. Include this option to avoid publishing the content before its ready.
redirectFrom | A list of directory paths that should redirect to this file. This is useful if the page has moved and you want old URLs to continue working.
updatedOn | This attribute is added automatically. You do not need to add it.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: Connect a Next.js application to Neon
subtitle: Set up a Neon project and connect from a Next.js application
enableTableOfContents: true
redirectFrom:
  - /docs/content/<old_directory_name>
updatedOn: '2023-10-07T12:25:27.662Z'
---
```

## Heading levels

The page title in the frontmatter is translated into an `h1` element when the page is converted to HTML.

Top-level section headings in the body of your document are defined with two hash characters, which is equivalent to an `h2` heading:

```md
## Section heading
```

To add a subsection heading, equivalent to an `h3`, add another `#` character:

```md
### Subsection heading
```

- Try to avoid heading levels beyond h4 (`####`).
- Do not skip a level, e.g., do not go from `##` to `####`.
- Ensure there's a blank line before and after each heading.

## Common markup

```md
External link markup: [Example.com website](https://www.example.com/)
Neon documentation page link: [Connection from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app)
Neon documentation same page link: [Code blocks](#code-blocks)
Italics markup: _italic_
Bold markup: **strong**
monospace: `backtick`
```

## Code blocks

To insert a code block into your Markdown file, specify three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code. Specify the language identifier to enable code highlighting, as in this example:

````md
```sql
SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id;
```
````

You can add language-specific highlighting to code blocks, as in the example above. See [Supported language highlighting for code blocks](https://prismjs.com/index.html#supported-languages).

You can also wrap code blocks in `<CodeBlock></CodeBlock>` tags to show line numbers or wrap long strings.

`<CodeBlock>` accepts the following options:

- `showLineNumbers`: Shows the line numbers in the code block
- `shouldWrap`: Enables code wrapping in the code block. This is useful for long commands or connection strings that would otherwise require the reader to scroll.

Example:

````md
<CodeBlock shouldWrap>

```bash
A really long line that scrolls off the page
```

</CodeBlock>
````

## Code tabs

To display code tabs, enclose all pieces of code within `<CodeTabs></CodeTabs>` and specify labels in order, as shown in the following example:

````md
<CodeTabs labels={["node-postgres", "postgres.js"]}>

  ```shell
  npm install pg
  ```

  ```shell
  npm install postgres
  ```

</CodeTabs>
````

To view this example in the Neon documentation, see [Create a Next.js project and add dependencies](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/nextjs#create-a-nextjs-project-and-add-dependencies).

## Admonitions

The Neon documentation supports the following admonitions:

- Note
- Important
- Tip
- Warning
- Info

To use an admonition, enclose your text with `<Admonition></Admonition>` and specify the admonition type: `note`, `important`, `tip`, `warning`, and `info`. The default is `note`.

```md
<Admonition type="note">
This is an important note
</Admonition>
```

You can specify a title with the `title` property.

```md
<Admonition type="note" title="Very important note">
This is a very important note.
</Admonition>
```

Example output:

<Admonition type="note" title="Very important note">
This is a very important note.
</Admonition>

## Diagrams and screen captures

Neon uses Figma to create diagrams.

If you're interested in updating or adding a diagram, please open a GitHub issue with your suggestions. Please include a draft, if possible. You can use a tool like [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) to create a draft.

If possible, please take screen captures on a high resolution monitor (UHD/4K). Screen captures should be unaltered (no borders or special effects).

Diagrams and images are stored in the `/public/docs` directory in the Neon website repository. The directory location of the diagram or image under `public` mirrors the location of the file that includes the diagram or image, as shown below:

Example file structure:

```md
âââ content
â âââ docs
â   âââ introduction
â     âââ architecture-overview.md


âââ public
â âââ docs
â   âââ introduction
â     âââ neon_architecture.png // put images in the public directory with the same name
```

To add an image to your Markdown file, add an entry that looks like this:

```md
![Neon architecture diagram](/docs/introduction/neon_architecture.png)
```

## Style Guide

This section outlines the stylistic elements that we do our best to follow in the Neon documentation.

### Voice and language

The voice in the documentation should sound like one human being explaining something to another, while striking the right balance between being approachable and professional.

#### Guidelines

1. **Use contractions**:
    - **Do**: Use contractions like "it's", "don't", "you're" to make the tone more conversational.
      - *Example*: "It's essential to save your progress."
    - **Don't**: Overuse contractions, which can compromise clarity.

2. **Simplicity over jargon**:
    - **Do**: Choose simpler words when possible.
      - *Example*: "Use the tool," not "Utilize the instrument."
    - **Don't**: Oversimplify to the point of being inaccurate or leaving out useful context.

3. **Active voice**:
    - **Do**: Prefer active voice.
      - *Example*: "The software converts the file."
    - **Don't**: Over-rely on passive voice.
      - *Example*: "The file is converted by the software."

4. **Brief sentences**:
    - **Do**: Keep sentences concise.
      - *Example*: "Check the settings."

5. **Personalize when relevant**:
    - **Do**: Use "you" to address the reader.
      - *Example*: "You can adjust the setting."
    - **Don't**: Overdo direct addresses. Not every sentence should start with "You".

6. **Consistent terminology**:
    - **Do**: Stick to one term for one concept.
      - *Example*: Always use "dashboard". Don't mix that term with "control panel".
    - **Don't**: Confuse with synonyms.
      - *Example*: Switching between "log-in", "sign-in", and "access point".

7. **Examples for clarity**:
    - **Do**: Provide clear examples.
      - *Example*: "For instance, to upload a file, click on the 'Upload' button."

8. **Use US English**:
    - **Do**: Adhere to US English spelling and grammar rules.

9. **Avoid emojis and exclamations**:
    - **Don't**: Use emojis or exclamation marks in the documentation.

### Link instead of repeating text

Avoid repeating or duplicating information from other topics. Instead, link to the original source of information and explain why it is important.

### Capitalization

Use lowercase wherever possible.

For topic titles, use sentence-style capitalization. For example: "Create your first project"

Product names should align with the official names of the products, protocols, etc., maintaining exact capitalization.

#### UI text

When referencing specific user interface text, such as button labels or menu items, use the same capitalization displayed in the user interface wherever possible.

#### Feature names

Generally, feature names should be lowercase.

#### Other terms

Capitalize names of:

- Neon tiers and plans. For example, Neon Free Tier, Neon Pro Plan.
- Third-party organizations, software, and products. Kubernetes, Git, and Vercel.
- Methods or methodologies. Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, etc.

Follow the capitalization style used by the authoritative source, which may use non-standard case styles. For example: PostgreSQL, GitHub, npm.

### Fake user information

When including user information in connection details, API calls, or UI instructions, don't use real user information or email addresses.

- Use an email address ending in `@example.com` or `domain.com`.
- Use strings like `example_username` or one of the following diverse and non-gendered names: Zhang Kai, Alex Lopez, or Dana Smith.

### Connection strings

Connection strings should be defined as follows:

```text
postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
```

If you need to provide a connection string with realistic values, use one of the user names mentioned above, `AbC123dEf` for the password, and `dbname` for the database name:

```text
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
```

### Commands, parameters, values, filenames

Commands, parameters, values, filenames, error messages, connection strings, and other similar items should be enclosed in backticks. For example:

- "Run the `neonctl projects list` command."

- "Execute `git clone` to clone a Git repository..."

- `git clone` is a command that should be in lowercase, whereas Git is the product and should have a capital G.

- "A connection string has this format: `postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]`"
