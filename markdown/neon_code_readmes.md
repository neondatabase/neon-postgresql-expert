# How to contribute

Howdy! Usual good software engineering practices apply. Write
tests. Write comments. Follow standard Rust coding practices where
possible. Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to tidy up formatting.

There are soft spots in the code, which could use cleanup,
refactoring, additional comments, and so forth. Let's try to raise the
bar, and clean things up as we go. Try to leave code in a better shape
than it was before.

## Pre-commit hook

We have a sample pre-commit hook in `pre-commit.py`.
To set it up, run:

```bash
ln -s ../../pre-commit.py .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will run following checks on staged files before each commit:
- `rustfmt`
- checks for Python files, see [obligatory checks](/docs/sourcetree.md#obligatory-checks).

There is also a separate script `./run_clippy.sh` that runs `cargo clippy` on the whole project
and `./scripts/reformat` that runs all formatting tools to ensure the project is up to date.

If you want to skip the hook, run `git commit` with `--no-verify` option.

## Submitting changes

1. Get at least one +1 on your PR before you push.

   For simple patches, it will only take a minute for someone to review
it.

2. Don't force push small changes after making the PR ready for review.
Doing so will force readers to re-read your entire PR, which will delay
the review process.

3. Always keep the CI green.

   Do not push, if the CI failed on your PR. Even if you think it's not
your patch's fault. Help to fix the root cause if something else has
broken the CI, before pushing.

*Happy Hacking!*

# How to run a CI pipeline on Pull Requests from external contributors
_An instruction for maintainers_

## TL;DR:
- Review the PR
- If and only if it looks **safe** (i.e. it doesn't contain any malicious code which could expose secrets or harm the CI), then:
    - Press the "Approve and run" button in GitHub UI
    - Add the `approved-for-ci-run` label to the PR
    - Currently draft PR will skip e2e test (only for internal contributors). After turning the PR 'Ready to Review' CI will trigger e2e test
      - Add `run-e2e-tests-in-draft` label to run e2e test in draft PR (override above behaviour)
      - The `approved-for-ci-run` workflow will add `run-e2e-tests-in-draft` automatically to run e2e test for external contributors

Repeat all steps after any change to the PR.
- When the changes are ready to get merged — merge the original PR (not the internal one)

## Longer version:

GitHub Actions triggered by the `pull_request` event don't share repository secrets with the forks (for security reasons).
So, passing the CI pipeline on Pull Requests from external contributors is impossible.

We're using the following approach to make it work:
- After the review, assign the `approved-for-ci-run` label to the PR if changes look safe
- A GitHub Action will create an internal branch and a new PR with the same changes (for example, for a PR `#1234`, it'll be a branch `ci-run/pr-1234`)
- Because the PR is created from the internal branch, it is able to access repository secrets (that's why it's crucial to make sure that the PR doesn't contain any malicious code that could expose our secrets or intentionally harm the CI)
- The label gets removed automatically, so to run CI again with new changes, the label should be added again (after the review)

For details see [`approved-for-ci-run.yml`](.github/workflows/approved-for-ci-run.yml)

## How do I make build-tools image "pinned"

It's possible to update the `pinned` tag of the `build-tools` image using the `pin-build-tools-image.yml` workflow.

```bash
gh workflow -R neondatabase/neon run pin-build-tools-image.yml \
            -f from-tag=cc98d9b00d670f182c507ae3783342bd7e64c31e
```


# Content from file ../neon/README.md:

[![Neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/assets/11527560/f15a17f0-836e-40c5-b35d-030606a6b660)](https://neon.tech)



# Neon

Neon is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Quick start
Try the [Neon Free Tier](https://neon.tech/github) to create a serverless Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc) or use the online [SQL Editor](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor/). See [Connect from any application](https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app/) for connection instructions.

Alternatively, compile and run the project [locally](#running-local-installation).

## Architecture overview

A Neon installation consists of compute nodes and the Neon storage engine. Compute nodes are stateless PostgreSQL nodes backed by the Neon storage engine.

The Neon storage engine consists of two major components:
- Pageserver: Scalable storage backend for the compute nodes.
- Safekeepers: The safekeepers form a redundant WAL service that received WAL from the compute node, and stores it durably until it has been processed by the pageserver and uploaded to cloud storage.

See developer documentation in [SUMMARY.md](/docs/SUMMARY.md) for more information.

## Running local installation


#### Installing dependencies on Linux
1. Install build dependencies and other applicable packages

* On Ubuntu or Debian, this set of packages should be sufficient to build the code:
```bash
apt install build-essential libtool libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison libseccomp-dev \
libssl-dev clang pkg-config libpq-dev cmake postgresql-client protobuf-compiler \
libprotobuf-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev openssl python3-poetry lsof libicu-dev
```
* On Fedora, these packages are needed:
```bash
dnf install flex bison readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel \
  libseccomp-devel perl clang cmake postgresql postgresql-contrib protobuf-compiler \
  protobuf-devel libcurl-devel openssl poetry lsof libicu-devel libpq-devel python3-devel \
  libffi-devel
```
* On Arch based systems, these packages are needed:
```bash
pacman -S base-devel readline zlib libseccomp openssl clang \
postgresql-libs cmake postgresql protobuf curl lsof
```

Building Neon requires 3.15+ version of `protoc` (protobuf-compiler). If your distribution provides an older version, you can install a newer version from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Installing dependencies on macOS (12.3.1)
1. Install XCode and dependencies
```
xcode-select --install
brew install protobuf openssl flex bison icu4c pkg-config m4

# add openssl to PATH, required for ed25519 keys generation in neon_local
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix openssl)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If you get errors about missing `m4` you may have to install it manually:
```
brew install m4
brew link --force m4
```

2. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
```
# recommended approach from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Install PostgreSQL Client
```
# from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
```

#### Rustc version

The project uses [rust toolchain file](./rust-toolchain.toml) to define the version it's built with in CI for testing and local builds.

This file is automatically picked up by [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#the-toolchain-file) that installs (if absent) and uses the toolchain version pinned in the file.

rustup users who want to build with another toolchain can use the [`rustup override`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#directory-overrides) command to set a specific toolchain for the project's directory.

non-rustup users most probably are not getting the same toolchain automatically from the file, so are responsible to manually verify that their toolchain matches the version in the file.
Newer rustc versions most probably will work fine, yet older ones might not be supported due to some new features used by the project or the crates.

#### Building on Linux

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use "BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`nproc` -s"
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`nproc` -s
```

#### Building on OSX

1. Build neon and patched postgres
```
# Note: The path to the neon sources can not contain a space.

git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git
cd neon

# The preferred and default is to make a debug build. This will create a
# demonstrably slower build than a release build. For a release build,
# use "BUILD_TYPE=release make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s"
# Remove -s for the verbose build log

make -j`sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` -s
```

#### Dependency installation notes
To run the `psql` client, install the `postgresql-client` package or modify `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `pg_install/bin` and `pg_install/lib`, respectively.

To run the integration tests or Python scripts (not required to use the code), install
Python (3.11 or higher), and install the python3 packages using `./scripts/pysync` (requires [poetry>=1.8](https://python-poetry.org/)) in the project directory.


#### Running neon database
1. Start pageserver and postgres on top of it (should be called from repo root):
```sh
# Create repository in .neon with proper paths to binaries and data
# Later that would be responsibility of a package install script
> cargo neon init
Initializing pageserver node 1 at '127.0.0.1:64000' in ".neon"

# start pageserver, safekeeper, and broker for their intercommunication
> cargo neon start
Starting neon broker at 127.0.0.1:50051.
storage_broker started, pid: 2918372
Starting pageserver node 1 at '127.0.0.1:64000' in ".neon".
pageserver started, pid: 2918386
Starting safekeeper at '127.0.0.1:5454' in '.neon/safekeepers/sk1'.
safekeeper 1 started, pid: 2918437

# create initial tenant and use it as a default for every future neon_local invocation
> cargo neon tenant create --set-default
tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c successfully created on the pageserver
Created an initial timeline 'de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9' at Lsn 0/16B5A50 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c
Setting tenant 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c as a default one

# create postgres compute node
> cargo neon endpoint create main

# start postgres compute node
> cargo neon endpoint start main
Starting new endpoint main (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9 ...
Starting postgres at 'postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres'

# check list of running postgres instances
> cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT  ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME  LSN        STATUS
 main      127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main         0/16B5BA8  running
```

2. Now, it is possible to connect to postgres and run some queries:
```text
> psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1,1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

3. And create branches and run postgres on them:
```sh
# create branch named migration_check
> cargo neon timeline branch --branch-name migration_check
Created timeline 'b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601' at Lsn 0/16F9A00 for tenant: 9ef87a5bf0d92544f6fafeeb3239695c. Ancestor timeline: 'main'

# check branches tree
> cargo neon timeline list
(L) main [de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9]
(L) ┗━ @0/16F9A00: migration_check [b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601]

# create postgres on that branch
> cargo neon endpoint create migration_check --branch-name migration_check

# start postgres on that branch
> cargo neon endpoint start migration_check
Starting new endpoint migration_check (PostgreSQL v14) on timeline b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601 ...
Starting postgres at 'postgresql://cloud_admin@127.0.0.1:55434/postgres'

# check the new list of running postgres instances
> cargo neon endpoint list
 ENDPOINT         ADDRESS          TIMELINE                          BRANCH NAME      LSN        STATUS
 main             127.0.0.1:55432  de200bd42b49cc1814412c7e592dd6e9  main             0/16F9A38  running
 migration_check  127.0.0.1:55434  b3b863fa45fa9e57e615f9f2d944e601  migration_check  0/16F9A70  running

# this new postgres instance will have all the data from 'main' postgres,
# but all modifications would not affect data in original postgres
> psql -p 55434 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

postgres=# insert into t values(2,2);
INSERT 0 1

# check that the new change doesn't affect the 'main' postgres
> psql -p 55432 -h 127.0.0.1 -U cloud_admin postgres
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)
```

4. If you want to run tests afterwards (see below), you must stop all the running pageserver, safekeeper, and postgres instances
   you have just started. You can terminate them all with one command:
```sh
> cargo neon stop
```

More advanced usages can be found at [Control Plane and Neon Local](./control_plane/README.md).

#### Handling build failures

If you encounter errors during setting up the initial tenant, it's best to stop everything (`cargo neon stop`) and remove the `.neon` directory. Then fix the problems, and start the setup again.

## Running tests

### Rust unit tests

We are using [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to run the tests in Github Workflows.
Some crates do not support running plain `cargo test` anymore, prefer `cargo nextest run` instead.
You can install `cargo-nextest` with `cargo install cargo-nextest`.

### Integration tests

Ensure your dependencies are installed as described [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon#dependency-installation-notes).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/neondatabase/neon.git

CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS="--features=testing" make

./scripts/pytest
```

By default, this runs both debug and release modes, and all supported postgres versions. When
testing locally, it is convenient to run just one set of permutations, like this:

```sh
DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=16 BUILD_TYPE=release ./scripts/pytest
```

## Flamegraphs

You may find yourself in need of flamegraphs for software in this repository.
You can use [`flamegraph-rs`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph) or the original [`flamegraph.pl`](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph). Your choice!

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using `lld` or `mold`, you need the `--no-rosegment` linker argument.
> It's a [general thing with Rust / lld / mold](https://crbug.com/919499#c16), not specific to this repository.
> See [this PR for further instructions](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6764).

## Cleanup

For cleaning up the source tree from build artifacts, run `make clean` in the source directory.

For removing every artifact from build and configure steps, run `make distclean`, and also consider removing the cargo binaries in the `target` directory, as well as the database in the `.neon` directory. Note that removing the `.neon` directory will remove your database, with all data in it. You have been warned!

## Documentation

[docs](/docs) Contains a top-level overview of all available markdown documentation.

- [sourcetree.md](/docs/sourcetree.md) contains overview of source tree layout.

To view your `rustdoc` documentation in a browser, try running `cargo doc --no-deps --open`

### Postgres-specific terms

Due to Neon's very close relation with PostgreSQL internals, numerous specific terms are used.
The same applies to certain spelling: i.e. we use MB to denote 1024 * 1024 bytes, while MiB would be technically more correct, it's inconsistent with what PostgreSQL code and its documentation use.

To get more familiar with this aspect, refer to:

- [Neon glossary](/docs/glossary.md)
- [PostgreSQL glossary](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/glossary.html)
- Other PostgreSQL documentation and sources (Neon fork sources can be found [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres))

In addition to these, postgres itself, the neon postgres extension,
and compute_ctl are built and copied into the compute image by
compute-node.Dockerfile.


# Content from file ../neon/compute/etc/README.md:

# Compute Configuration

These files are the configuration files for various other pieces of software
that will be running in the compute alongside Postgres.

## `sql_exporter`

### Adding a `sql_exporter` Metric

We use `sql_exporter` to export various metrics from Postgres. In order to add
a metric, you will need to create two files: a `libsonnet` and a `sql` file. You
will then import the `libsonnet` file in one of the collector files, and the
`sql` file will be imported in the `libsonnet` file.

In the event your statistic is an LSN, you may want to cast it to a `float8`
because Prometheus only supports floats. It's probably fine because `float8` can
store integers from `-2^53` to `+2^53` exactly.


# Content from file ../neon/compute_tools/README.md:

# Compute node tools

Postgres wrapper (`compute_ctl`) is intended to be run as a Docker entrypoint or as a `systemd`
`ExecStart` option. It will handle all the `Neon` specifics during compute node
initialization:
- `compute_ctl` accepts cluster (compute node) specification as a JSON file.
- Every start is a fresh start, so the data directory is removed and
  initialized again on each run.
- Next it will put configuration files into the `PGDATA` directory.
- Sync safekeepers and get commit LSN.
- Get `basebackup` from pageserver using the returned on the previous step LSN.
- Try to start `postgres` and wait until it is ready to accept connections.
- Check and alter/drop/create roles and databases.
- Hang waiting on the `postmaster` process to exit.

Also `compute_ctl` spawns two separate service threads:
- `compute-monitor` checks the last Postgres activity timestamp and saves it
  into the shared `ComputeNode`;
- `http-endpoint` runs a Hyper HTTP API server, which serves readiness and the
  last activity requests.

If `AUTOSCALING` environment variable is set, `compute_ctl` will start the
`vm-monitor` located in [`neon/libs/vm_monitor`]. For VM compute nodes,
`vm-monitor` communicates with the VM autoscaling system. It coordinates
downscaling and requests immediate upscaling under resource pressure.

Usage example:
```sh
compute_ctl -D /var/db/postgres/compute \
            -C 'postgresql://cloud_admin@localhost/postgres' \
            -S /var/db/postgres/specs/current.json \
            -b /usr/local/bin/postgres
```

## State Diagram

Computes can be in various states. Below is a diagram that details how a
compute moves between states.

## Tests

Cargo formatter:
```sh
cargo fmt
```

Run tests:
```sh
cargo test
```

Clippy linter:
```sh
cargo clippy --all --all-targets -- -Dwarnings -Drust-2018-idioms
```

## Cross-platform compilation

Imaging that you are on macOS (x86) and you want a Linux GNU (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` platform in `rust` terminology) executable.

### Using docker

You can use a throw-away Docker container ([rustlang/rust](https://hub.docker.com/r/rustlang/rust/) image) for doing that:
```sh
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/compute_tools \
    -w /compute_tools \
    -t rustlang/rust:nightly cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
or one-line:
```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/compute_tools -w /compute_tools -t rust:latest cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Using rust native cross-compilation

Another way is to add `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target on your host system:
```sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Install macOS cross-compiler toolchain:
```sh
brew tap SergioBenitez/osxct
brew install x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

And finally run `cargo build`:
```sh
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```


# Content from file ../neon/control_plane/README.md:

# Control Plane and Neon Local

This crate contains tools to start a Neon development environment locally. This utility can be used with the `cargo neon` command.

## Example: Start with Postgres 16

To create and start a local development environment with Postgres 16, you will need to provide `--pg-version` flag to 3 of the start-up commands.

```shell
cargo neon init --pg-version 16
cargo neon start
cargo neon tenant create --set-default --pg-version 16
cargo neon endpoint create main --pg-version 16
cargo neon endpoint start main
```

## Example: Create Test User and Database

By default, `cargo neon` starts an endpoint with `cloud_admin` and `postgres` database. If you want to have a role and a database similar to what we have on the cloud service, you can do it with the following commands when starting an endpoint.

```shell
cargo neon endpoint create main --pg-version 16 --update-catalog true
cargo neon endpoint start main --create-test-user true
```

The first command creates `neon_superuser` and necessary roles. The second command creates `test` user and `neondb` database. You will see a connection string that connects you to the test user after running the second command.


# Content from file ../neon/docker-compose/README.md:


# Example docker compose configuration

The configuration in this directory is used for testing Neon docker images: it is
not intended for deploying a usable system. To run a development environment where
you can experiment with a miniature Neon system, use `cargo neon` rather than container images.

This configuration does not start the storage controller, because the controller
needs a way to reconfigure running computes, and no such thing exists in this setup.

## Authentication

### Overview
We use JWT tokens in communication between almost all components (compute, pageserver, safekeeper, CLI) regardless of the protocol used (HTTP/PostgreSQL).
storage_broker currently has no authentication.
Authentication is optional and is disabled by default for easier debugging.
It is used in some tests, though.
Note that we do not cover authentication with `pg.neon.tech` here.

For HTTP connections we use the Bearer authentication scheme.
For PostgreSQL connections we expect the token to be passed as a password.
There is a caveat for `psql`: it silently truncates passwords to 100 symbols, so to correctly pass JWT via `psql` you have to either use `PGPASSWORD` environment variable, or store password in `psql`'s config file.

Current token scopes are described in `utils::auth::Scope`.
There are no expiration or rotation schemes.

_TODO_: some scopes allow both access to server management API and to the data.
These probably should be split into multiple scopes.

Tokens should not occur in logs.
They may sometimes occur in configuration files, although this is discouraged
because configs may be parsed and dumped into logs.

#### Tokens generation and validation
JWT tokens are signed using a private key.
Compute/pageserver/safekeeper use the private key's public counterpart to validate JWT tokens.
These components should not have access to the private key and may only get tokens from their configuration or external clients. 

The key pair is generated once for an installation of compute/pageserver/safekeeper, e.g. by `neon_local init`.
There is currently no way to rotate the key without bringing down all components.

### Best practices

See [RFC 8725: JSON Web Token Best Current Practices](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725)


### Token format

The JWT tokens in Neon use "EdDSA" as the algorithm (defined in [RFC8037](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8037)).

Example:

Header:

```
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Payload:

```
{
  "scope": "tenant",  # "tenant", "pageserverapi", or "safekeeperdata"
  "tenant_id": "5204921ff44f09de8094a1390a6a50f6",
}
```


Meanings of scope:

"tenant": Provides access to all data for a specific tenant

"pageserverapi": Provides blanket access to all tenants on the pageserver plus pageserver-wide APIs.
Should only be used e.g. for status check/tenant creation/list.

"safekeeperdata": Provides blanket access to all data on the safekeeper plus safekeeper-wide APIs.
Should only be used e.g. for status check.
Currently also used for connection from any pageserver to any safekeeper.

"generations_api": Provides access to the upcall APIs served by the storage controller or the control plane.

"admin": Provides access to the control plane and admin APIs of the storage controller.

### CLI
CLI generates a key pair during call to `neon_local init` with the following commands:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out auth_private_key.pem
openssl pkey -in auth_private_key.pem -pubout -out auth_public_key.pem
```

Configuration files for all components point to `public_key.pem` for JWT validation.
However, authentication is disabled by default.
There is no way to automatically enable it everywhere, you have to configure each component individually.

CLI also generates signed token (full access to Pageserver) and saves it in
the CLI's `config` file under `pageserver.auth_token`.
Note that pageserver's config does not have any similar parameter.
CLI is the only component which accesses that token.
Technically it could generate it from the private key on each run,
but it does not do that for some reason (_TODO_).

### Compute
#### Overview
Compute is a per-timeline PostgreSQL instance, so it should not have
any access to data of other tenants.
All tokens used by a compute are restricted to a specific tenant.
There is no auth isolation from other timelines of the same tenant,
but a non-rogue client never accesses another timeline even by an accident:
timeline IDs are random and hard to guess.

#### Incoming connections
All incoming connections are from PostgreSQL clients.
Their authentication is just plain PostgreSQL authentication and out of scope for this document.

There is no administrative API except those provided by PostgreSQL.

#### Outgoing connections
Compute connects to Pageserver for getting pages. The connection string is
configured by the `neon.pageserver_connstring` PostgreSQL GUC,
e.g. `postgresql://no_user@localhost:15028`. If the `$NEON_AUTH_TOKEN`
environment variable is set, it is used as the password for the connection. (The
pageserver uses JWT tokens for authentication, so the password is really a
token.)

Compute connects to Safekeepers to write and commit data. The list of safekeeper
addresses is given in the `neon.safekeepers` GUC. The connections to the
safekeepers take the password from the `$NEON_AUTH_TOKEN` environment
variable, if set.

The `compute_ctl` binary that runs before the PostgreSQL server, and launches
PostgreSQL, also makes a connection to the pageserver. It uses it to fetch the
initial "base backup" dump, to initialize the PostgreSQL data directory. It also
uses `$NEON_AUTH_TOKEN` as the password for the connection.

### Pageserver
#### Overview
Pageserver keeps track of multiple tenants, each having multiple timelines.
For each timeline, it connects to the corresponding Safekeeper.
Information about "corresponding Safekeeper" is published by Safekeepers
in the storage_broker, but they do not publish access tokens, otherwise what is
the point of authentication.

Pageserver keeps a connection to some set of Safekeepers, which
may or may not correspond to active Computes.
Hence, we cannot obtain a per-timeline access token from a Compute.
E.g. if the timeline's Compute terminates before all WAL is
consumed by the Pageserver, the Pageserver continues consuming WAL.

Pageserver replicas' authentication is the same as the main's.

#### Incoming connections
Pageserver listens for connections from computes.
Each compute should present a token valid for the timeline's tenant.

Pageserver also has HTTP API: some parts are per-tenant,
some parts are server-wide, these are different scopes.

Authentication can be enabled separately for the HTTP mgmt API, and
for the libpq connections from compute. The `http_auth_type` and
`pg_auth_type` configuration variables in Pageserver's config may
have one of these values:

* `Trust` removes all authentication.
* `NeonJWT` enables JWT validation.
   Tokens are validated using the public key which lies in a PEM file
   specified in the `auth_validation_public_key_path` config.

#### Outgoing connections
Pageserver makes a connection to a Safekeeper for each active timeline.
As Pageserver may want to access any timeline it has on the disk,
it is given a blanket JWT token to access any data on any Safekeeper.
This token is passed through an environment variable called `NEON_AUTH_TOKEN`
(non-configurable as of writing this text).

A better way _may be_ to store JWT token for each timeline next to it,
but may be not.

### Safekeeper
#### Overview
Safekeeper keeps track of multiple tenants, each having multiple timelines.

#### Incoming connections
Safekeeper accepts connections from Compute/Pageserver, each
connection corresponds to a specific timeline and requires
a corresponding JWT token.

Safekeeper also has HTTP API: some parts are per-tenant,
some parts are server-wide, these are different scopes.

The `auth-validation-public-key-path` command line options controls
the authentication mode:

* If the option is missing, there is no authentication or JWT token validation.
* If the option is present, it should be a path to the public key PEM file used for JWT token validation.

#### Outgoing connections
No connections are initiated by a Safekeeper.

### In the source code
Tests do not use authentication by default.
If you need it, you can enable it by configuring the test's environment:

```python
neon_env_builder.auth_enabled = True
```

You will have to generate tokens if you want to access components inside the test directly,
use `AuthKeys.generate_*_token` methods for that.
If you create a new scope, please create a new method to prevent mistypes in scope's name.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/consumption_metrics.md:

### Overview
Pageserver and proxy periodically collect consumption metrics and push them to a HTTP endpoint.

This doc describes current implementation details.
For design details see [the RFC](./rfcs/021-metering.md) and [the discussion on Github](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/2884).

- The metrics are collected in a separate thread, and the collection interval and endpoint are configurable.

- Metrics are cached, so that we don't send unchanged metrics on every iteration.

- Metrics are sent in batches of 1000 (see CHUNK_SIZE const) metrics max with no particular grouping guarantees.

batch format is
```json

{ "events" : [metric1, metric2, ...]]}

```
See metric format examples below.

- All metrics values are in bytes, unless otherwise specified.

- Currently no retries are implemented.

### Pageserver metrics

#### Configuration
The endpoint and the collection interval are specified in the pageserver config file (or can be passed as command line arguments):
`metric_collection_endpoint` defaults to None, which means that metric collection is disabled by default.
`metric_collection_interval` defaults to 10min

#### Metrics

Currently, the following metrics are collected:

- `written_size`

Amount of WAL produced , by a timeline, i.e. last_record_lsn
This is an absolute, per-timeline metric.

- `resident_size`

Size of all the layer files in the tenant's directory on disk on the pageserver.
This is an absolute, per-tenant metric.

- `remote_storage_size`

Size of the remote storage (S3) directory.
This is an absolute, per-tenant metric.

- `timeline_logical_size`
Logical size of the data in the timeline
This is an absolute, per-timeline metric.

- `synthetic_storage_size`
Size of all tenant's branches including WAL
This is the same metric that `tenant/{tenant_id}/size` endpoint returns.
This is an absolute, per-tenant metric.

Synthetic storage size is calculated in a separate thread, so it might be slightly outdated.

#### Format example

```json
{
"metric": "remote_storage_size",
"type": "absolute",
"time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"idempotency_key": "2022-12-28 11:07:19.317310324 UTC-1-4019",
"value": 12345454,
"tenant_id": "5d07d9ce9237c4cd845ea7918c0afa7d",
"timeline_id": "a03ebb4f5922a1c56ff7485cc8854143",
}
```

`idempotency_key` is a unique key for each metric, so that we can deduplicate metrics.
It is a combination of the time, node_id and a random number.

### Proxy consumption metrics

#### Configuration
The endpoint and the collection interval can be passed as command line arguments for proxy:
`metric_collection_endpoint` no default, which means that metric collection is disabled by default.
`metric_collection_interval` no default

#### Metrics

Currently, only one proxy metric is collected:

- `proxy_io_bytes_per_client`
Outbound traffic per client.
This is an incremental, per-endpoint metric.

#### Format example

```json
{
"metric": "proxy_io_bytes_per_client",
"type": "incremental",
"start_time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"stop_time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"idempotency_key": "2022-12-28 11:07:19.317310324 UTC-1-4019",
"value": 12345454,
"endpoint_id": "5d07d9ce9237c4cd845ea7918c0afa7d",
}
```

The metric is incremental, so the value is the difference between the current and the previous value.
If there is no previous value, the value, the value is the current value and the `start_time` equals `stop_time`.

### TODO

- [ ] Handle errors better: currently if one tenant fails to gather metrics, the whole iteration fails and metrics are not sent for any tenant.
- [ ] Add retries
- [ ] Tune the interval

# Content from file ../neon/docs/core_changes.md:

# Postgres core changes

This lists all the changes that have been made to the PostgreSQL
source tree, as a somewhat logical set of patches. The long-term goal
is to eliminate all these changes, by submitting patches to upstream
and refactoring code into extensions, so that you can run unmodified
PostgreSQL against Neon storage.

In Neon, we run PostgreSQL in the compute nodes, but we also run a special WAL redo process in the
page server. We currently use the same binary for both, with --wal-redo runtime flag to launch it in
the WAL redo mode. Some PostgreSQL changes are needed in the compute node, while others are just for
the WAL redo process.

In addition to core PostgreSQL changes, there is a Neon extension in the pgxn/neon directory that
hooks into the smgr interface, and rmgr extension in pgxn/neon_rmgr. The extensions are loaded into
the Postgres processes with shared_preload_libraries. Most of the Neon-specific code is in the
extensions, and for any new features, that is preferred over modifying core PostgreSQL code.

Below is a list of all the PostgreSQL source code changes, categorized into changes needed for
compute, and changes needed for the WAL redo process:

# Changes for Compute node

## Prefetching

There are changes in many places to perform prefetching, for example for sequential scans. Neon
doesn't benefit from OS readahead, and the latency to pageservers is quite high compared to local
disk, so prefetching is critical for performance, also for sequential scans.

### How to get rid of the patch

Upcoming "streaming read" work in v17 might simplify this. And async I/O work in v18 will hopefully
do more.


## Add t_cid to heap WAL records

```
 src/backend/access/heap/heapam.c                            |   26 +-
 src/include/access/heapam_xlog.h                            |    6 +-
```

We have added a new t_cid field to heap WAL records. This changes the WAL record format, making Neon WAL format incompatible with vanilla PostgreSQL!

### Problem we're trying to solve

The problem is that the XLOG_HEAP_INSERT record does not include the command id of the inserted row. And same with deletion/update. So in the primary, a row is inserted with current xmin + cmin. But in the replica, the cmin is always set to 1. That works in PostgreSQL, because the command id is only relevant to the inserting transaction itself. After commit/abort, no one cares about it anymore. But with Neon, we rely on WAL replay to reconstruct the page, even while the original transaction is still running.

### How to get rid of the patch

Bite the bullet and submit the patch to PostgreSQL, to add the t_cid to the WAL records. It makes the WAL records larger, which could make this unpopular in the PostgreSQL community. However, it might simplify some logical decoding code; Andres Freund briefly mentioned in PGCon 2022 discussion on Heikki's Neon presentation that logical decoding currently needs to jump through some hoops to reconstruct the same information.

Update from Heikki (2024-04-17): I tried to write an upstream patch for that, to use the t_cid field for logical decoding, but it was not as straightforward as it first sounded.

### Alternatives
Perhaps we could write an extra WAL record with the t_cid information, when a page is evicted that contains rows that were touched a transaction that's still running. However, that seems very complicated.

## Mark index builds that use buffer manager without logging explicitly

also some changes in src/backend/storage/smgr/smgr.c
```

pgvector 0.6.0 also needs a similar change, which would be very nice to get rid of too.

When a GIN index is built, for example, it is built by inserting the entries into the index more or
less normally, but without WAL-logging anything. After the index has been built, we iterate through
all pages and write them to the WAL. That doesn't work for Neon, because if a page is not WAL-logged
and is evicted from the buffer cache, it is lost. We have an check to catch that in the Neon
extension. To fix that, we've added a few functions to track explicitly when we're performing such
an operation: `smgr_start_unlogged_build`, `smgr_finish_unlogged_build_phase_1` and
`smgr_end_unlogged_build`.


### How to get rid of the patch

I think it would make sense to be more explicit about that in PostgreSQL too. So extract these
changes to a patch and post to pgsql-hackers.

Perhaps we could deduce that an unlogged index build has started when we see a page being evicted
with zero LSN. How to be sure it's an unlogged index build rather than a bug? Currently we have a
check for that and PANIC if we see page with zero LSN being evicted. And how do we detect when the
index build has finished? See https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/7440 for an attempt at that.

## Track last-written page LSN

```
 src/backend/commands/dbcommands.c                           |   17 +-

Also one call to SetLastWrittenPageLSN() in spginsert.c, maybe elsewhere too
```

Whenever a page is evicted from the buffer cache, we remember its LSN, so that we can use the same
LSN in the GetPage@LSN request when reading the page back from the page server. The value is
conservative: it would be correct to always use the last-inserted LSN, but it would be slow because
then the page server would need to wait for the recent WAL to be streamed and processed, before
responding to any GetPage@LSN request.

The last-written page LSN is mostly tracked in the smgrwrite() function, without core code changes,
but there are a few exceptions where we've had to add explicit calls to the Neon-specific
SetLastWrittenPageLSN() function.

There's an open PR to track the LSN in a more-fine grained fashion:
https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/pull/177

PostgreSQL v15 introduces a new method to do CREATE DATABASE that WAL-logs the database instead of
relying copying files and checkpoint. With that method, we probably won't need any special handling.
The old method is still available, though.

### How to get rid of the patch

Wait until v15?


## Allow startup without reading checkpoint record

In Neon, the compute node is stateless. So when we are launching compute node, we need to provide
some dummy PG_DATADIR. Relation pages can be requested on demand from page server. But Postgres
still need some non-relational data: control and configuration files, SLRUs,...  It is currently
implemented using basebackup (do not mix with pg_basebackup) which is created by pageserver. It
includes in this tarball config/control files, SLRUs and required directories.

As pageserver does not have the original WAL segments, the basebackup tarball includes an empty WAL
segment to bootstrap the WAL writing, but it doesn't contain the checkpoint record.  There are some
changes in xlog.c, to allow starting the compute node without reading the last checkpoint record
from WAL.

This includes code to read the `zenith.signal` file, which tells the startup code the LSN to start
at. When the `zenith.signal` file is present, the startup uses that LSN instead of the last
checkpoint's LSN. The system is known to be consistent at that LSN, without any WAL redo.


### How to get rid of the patch

???


### Alternatives

Include a fake checkpoint record in the tarball. Creating fake WAL is a bit risky, though; I'm
afraid it might accidentally get streamed to the safekeepers and overwrite or corrupt the real WAL.

## Disable sequence caching

```

Due to performance reasons Postgres don't want to log each fetching of a value from a sequence, so
it pre-logs a few fetches in advance. In the event of crash we can lose (skip over) as many values
as we pre-logged. But with Neon, because page with sequence value can be evicted from buffer cache,
we can get a gap in sequence values even without crash.

### How to get rid of the patch

Maybe we can just remove it, and accept the gaps. Or add some special handling for sequence
relations in the Neon extension, to WAL log the sequence page when it's about to be evicted. It
would be weird if the sequence moved backwards though, think of PITR.

Or add a GUC for the amount to prefix to PostgreSQL, and force it to 1 in Neon.

```

Neon needs to treat unlogged relations differently from others, so the smgrread(), smgrwrite() etc.
implementations need to know the 'relpersistence' of the relation. To get that information where
it's needed, we added the 'relpersistence' field to smgropen().

### How to get rid of the patch

Maybe 'relpersistence' would be useful in PostgreSQL for debugging purposes? Or simply for the
benefit of extensions like Neon. Should consider this in the patch to make smgr API usable to
extensions.

## Alternatives

Currently in Neon, unlogged tables live on local disk in the compute node, and are wiped away on
compute node restart. One alternative would be to instead WAL-log even unlogged tables, essentially
ignoring the UNLOGGED option. Or prohibit UNLOGGED tables completely. But would we still need the
relpersistence argument to handle index builds? See item on "Mark index builds that use buffer
manager without logging explicitly".

## Use smgr and dbsize_hook for size calculations

```
 src/backend/utils/adt/dbsize.c                              |   61 +-

In PostgreSQL, the rel and db-size functions scan the data directory directly. That won't work in Neon.

### How to get rid of the patch

Send patch to PostgreSQL, to use smgr API functions for relation size calculation instead. Maybe as
part of the general smgr API patch.



# WAL redo process changes

Pageserver delegates complex WAL decoding duties to Postgres, which means that the latter might fall
victim to carefully designed malicious WAL records and start doing harmful things to the system.  To
prevent this, the redo functions are executed in a separate process that is sandboxed with Linux
Secure Computing mode (see seccomp(2) man page).

As an alternative to having a separate WAL redo process, we could rewrite all redo handlers in Rust
This is infeasible. However, it would take a lot of effort to rewrite them, ensure that you've done
the rewrite correctly, and once you've done that, it would be a lot of ongoing maintenance effort to
keep the rewritten code in sync over time, across new PostgreSQL versions. That's why we want to
leverage PostgreSQL code.

Another alternative would be to harden all the PostgreSQL WAL redo functions so that it would be
safe to call them directly from Rust code, without needing the security sandbox. That's not feasible
for similar reasons as rewriting them in Rust.

### Problem we're trying to solve

In PostgreSQL, if a WAL redo function calls XLogReadBufferForRead() for a page that has a full-page
image, it always succeeds. However, Neon WAL redo process is only concerned about replaying changes
to a singe page, so replaying any changes for other pages is a waste of cycles. We have modified
XLogReadBufferForRead() to return BLK_DONE for all other pages, to avoid the overhead. That is
unexpected by code like the above.

### How to get rid of the patch

Submit the changes to upstream, hope the community accepts them. There's no harm to PostgreSQL from
these changes, although it doesn't have any benefit either.

To make these changes useful to upstream PostgreSQL, we could implement a feature to look ahead the
WAL, and detect truncated relations. Even in PostgreSQL, it is a waste of cycles to replay changes
to pages that are later truncated away, so we could have XLogReadBufferForRedo() return BLK_DONE or
BLK_NOTFOUND for pages that are known to be truncated away later in the WAL stream.

### Alternatives

Maybe we could revert this optimization, and restore pages other than the target page too.

```

This is used to help with restoring a database when you have all the WAL, all the way back to
initdb, but no backup. You can reconstruct the missing backup by running initdb again, with the same
sysidentifier.


### How to get rid of the patch

Ignore it. This is only needed for disaster recovery, so once we've eliminated all other Postgres
patches, we can just keep it around as a patch or as separate branch in a repo.


## pg_waldump flags to ignore errors

After creating a new project or branch in Neon, the first timeline can begin in the middle of a WAL segment. pg_waldump chokes on that, so we added some flags to make it possible to ignore errors.

Like previous one, ignore it.

Previously, SLRU files were included in the basebackup, but the total size of them can be large,
several GB, and downloading them all made the startup time too long.

### Alternatives

FUSE hook or LD_PRELOAD trick to intercept the reads on SLRU files


## WAL-log an all-zeros page as one large hole

- In XLogRecordAssemble()

### Problem we're trying to solve

This change was made in v16. Starting with v16, when PostgreSQL extends a relation, it first extends
it with zeros, and it can extend the relation more than one block at a time. The all-zeros page is WAL-ogged, but it's very wasteful to include 8 kB of zeros in the WAL for that. This hack was made so that we WAL logged a compact record with a whole-page "hole". However, PostgreSQL has assertions that prevent that such WAL records from being replayed, so this breaks compatibility such that unmodified PostreSQL cannot process Neon-generated WAL.

### How to get rid of the patch

Find another compact representation for a full-page image of an all-zeros page. A compressed image perhaps.


## Shut down walproposer after checkpointer

```
+                       /* Neon: Also allow walproposer background worker to be treated like a WAL sender, so that it's shut down last */
+                       if ((bp->bkend_type == BACKEND_TYPE_NORMAL || bp->bkend_type == BACKEND_TYPE_BGWORKER) &&
```

This changes was needed so that postmaster shuts down the walproposer process only after the shutdown checkpoint record is written. Otherwise, the shutdown record will never make it to the safekeepers.

### How to get rid of the patch

Do a bigger refactoring of the postmaster state machine, such that a background worker can specify
the shutdown ordering by itself. The postmaster state machine has grown pretty complicated, and
would benefit from a refactoring for the sake of readability anyway.


## EXPLAIN changes for prefetch and LFC

### How to get rid of the patch

Konstantin submitted a patch to -hackers already: https://commitfest.postgresql.org/47/4643/. Get that into a committable state.


## On-demand download of extensions

### How to get rid of the patch

FUSE or LD_PRELOAD trickery to intercept reads?


## Publication superuser checks

We have hacked CreatePublication so that also neon_superuser can create them.

### How to get rid of the patch

Create an upstream patch with more fine-grained privileges for publications CREATE/DROP that can be GRANTed to users.


## WAL log replication slots

### How to get rid of the patch

Utilize the upcoming v17 "slot sync worker", or a similar neon-specific background worker process, to periodically WAL-log the slots, or to export them somewhere else.


## WAL-log replication snapshots

### How to get rid of the patch

WAL-log them periodically, from a backgound worker.


## WAL-log relmapper files

Similarly to replications snapshot files, the CID mapping files generated during VACUUM FULL of a catalog table are WAL-logged

### How to get rid of the patch

WAL-log them periodically, from a backgound worker.

# Not currently committed but proposed

## Disable ring buffer buffer manager strategies

### Why?

Postgres tries to avoid cache flushing by bulk operations (copy, seqscan, vacuum,...).
Even if there are free space in buffer cache, pages may be evicted.
Negative effect of it can be somehow compensated by file system cache, but in Neon,
cost of requesting page from page server is much higher.

### Alternatives?

Instead of just prohibiting ring buffer we may try to implement more flexible eviction policy,
for example copy evicted page from ring buffer to some other buffer if there is free space
in buffer cache.

## Disable marking page as dirty when hint bits are set.

### Why?

Postgres has to modify page twice: first time when some tuple is updated and second time when
hint bits are set. Wal logging hint bits updates requires FPI which significantly increase size of WAL.

### Alternatives?

Add special WAL record for setting page hints.

## Prewarming

### Why?

Short downtime (or, in other words, fast compute node restart time) is one of the key feature of Neon.
But overhead of request-response round-trip for loading pages on demand can make started node warm-up quite slow.
We can capture state of compute node buffer cache and send bulk request for this pages at startup.

# Docker images of Neon

## Images

Currently we build two main images:

- [neondatabase/neon](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neondatabase/neon) — image with pre-built `pageserver`, `safekeeper` and `proxy` binaries and all the required runtime dependencies. Built from [/Dockerfile](/Dockerfile).
- [neondatabase/compute-node-v16](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neondatabase/compute-node-v16) — compute node image with pre-built Postgres binaries from [neondatabase/postgres](https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres). Similar images exist for v15 and v14. Built from [/compute-node/Dockerfile](/compute/compute-node.Dockerfile).

And additional intermediate image:

- [neondatabase/compute-tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neondatabase/compute-tools) — compute node configuration management tools.

## Build pipeline

We build all images after a successful `release` tests run and push automatically to Docker Hub with two parallel CI jobs

1. `neondatabase/compute-tools` and `neondatabase/compute-node-v16` (and -v15 and -v14)

2. `neondatabase/neon`

## Docker Compose example

You can see a [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) example to create a neon cluster in [/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml). It creates the following containers.

- pageserver x 1
- safekeeper x 3
- storage_broker x 1
- compute x 1
- MinIO x 1        # This is Amazon S3 compatible object storage

### How to use

1. create containers

You can specify version of neon cluster using following environment values.
- PG_VERSION: postgres version for compute (default is 16 as of this writing)
- TAG: the tag version of [docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/neondatabase/neon/tags), which is tagged in [CI test](/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml). Default is 'latest'
```
$ cd docker-compose/
$ docker-compose down   # remove the containers if exists
$ PG_VERSION=16 TAG=latest docker-compose up --build -d  # You can specify the postgres and image version
Creating network "dockercompose_default" with the default driver
Creating docker-compose_storage_broker_1       ... done
(...omit...)
```

2. connect compute node
```
$ psql postgresql://cloud_admin:cloud_admin@localhost:55433/postgres
psql (16.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE TABLE t(key int primary key, value text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into t values(1, 1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from t;
 key | value
-----+-------
   1 | 1
(1 row)

```

3. If you want to see the log, you can use `docker-compose logs` command.
```
# check the container name you want to see
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                      NAMES
3582f6d76227   docker-compose_compute                             "/shell/compute.sh"      2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:3080->3080/tcp, :::3080->3080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:55433->55433/tcp, :::55433->55433/tcp   docker-compose_compute_1
(...omit...)

$ docker logs -f docker-compose_compute_1
2022-10-21 06:15:48.757 GMT [56] LOG:  connection authorized: user=cloud_admin database=postgres application_name=psql
2022-10-21 06:17:00.307 GMT [56] LOG:  [NEON_SMGR] libpagestore: connected to 'host=pageserver port=6400'
(...omit...)
```

4. If you want to see durable data in MinIO which is s3 compatible storage

Access http://localhost:9001 and sign in.

- Username: `minio`
- Password: `password`

You can see durable pages and WAL data in `neon` bucket.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/error-handling.md:

# Error handling and logging

## Logging errors

The principle is that errors are logged when they are handled. If you
just propagate an error to the caller in a function, you don't need to
log it; the caller will. But if you consume an error in a function,
you *must* log it (if it needs to be logged at all).

For example:

```rust
fn read_motd_file() -> std::io::Result<String> {
    let mut f = File::open("/etc/motd")?;
    let mut result = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut result)?;
    result
}
```

Opening or reading the file could fail, but there is no need to log
the error here. The function merely propagates the error to the
caller, and it is up to the caller to log the error or propagate it
further, if the failure is not expected. But if, for example, it is
normal that the "/etc/motd" file doesn't exist, the caller can choose
to silently ignore the error, or log it as an INFO or DEBUG level
message:

```rust
fn get_message_of_the_day() -> String {
    // Get the motd from /etc/motd, or return the default proverb
    match read_motd_file() {
        Ok(motd) => motd,
        Err(err)  => {
            // It's normal that /etc/motd doesn't exist, but if we fail to
            // read it for some other reason, that's unexpected. The message
            // of the day isn't very important though, so we just WARN and
            // continue with the default in any case.
            if err.kind() != std::io::ErrorKind::NotFound {
                 tracing::warn!("could not read \"/etc/motd\": {err:?}");
            }
            "An old error is always more popular than a new truth. - German proverb"
        }
    }
}
```

## Error types

We use the `anyhow` crate widely. It contains many convenient macros
like `bail!` and `ensure!` to construct and return errors, and to
propagate many kinds of low-level errors, wrapped in `anyhow::Error`.

A downside of `anyhow::Error` is that the caller cannot distinguish
between different error cases. Most errors are propagated all the way
to the mgmt API handler function, or the main loop that handles a
connection with the compute node, and they are all handled the same
way: the error is logged and returned to the client as an HTTP or
libpq error.

But in some cases, we need to distinguish between errors and handle
them differently. For example, attaching a tenant to the pageserver
could fail either because the tenant has already been attached, or
because we could not load its metadata from cloud storage. The first
case is more or less expected. The console sends the Attach request to
the pageserver, and the pageserver completes the operation, but the
network connection might be lost before the console receives the
response. The console will retry the operation in that case, but the
tenant has already been attached. It is important that the pagserver
responds with the HTTP 403 Already Exists error in that case, rather
than a generic HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.

If you need to distinguish between different kinds of errors, create a
new `Error` type. The `thiserror` crate is useful for that. But in
most cases `anyhow::Error` is good enough.

## Panics

Depending on where a panic happens, it can cause the whole pageserver
or safekeeper to restart, or just a single tenant. In either case,
that is pretty bad and causes an outage. Avoid panics. Never use
`unwrap()` or other calls that might panic, to verify inputs from the
network or from disk.

It is acceptable to use functions that might panic, like `unwrap()`, if
it is obvious that it cannot panic. For example, if you have just
checked that a variable is not None, it is OK to call `unwrap()` on it,
but it is still preferable to use `expect("reason")` instead to explain
why the function cannot fail.

`assert!` and `panic!` are reserved for checking clear invariants and
very obvious "can't happen" cases. When in doubt, use anyhow `ensure!`
or `bail!` instead.

## Error levels

`tracing::Level` doesn't provide very clear guidelines on what the
different levels mean, or when to use which level. Here is how we use
them:

### Error

Examples:
- could not open file "foobar"
- invalid tenant id

Errors are not expected to happen during normal operation. Incorrect
inputs from client can cause ERRORs. For example, if a client tries to
call a mgmt API that doesn't exist, or if a compute node sends passes
an LSN that has already been garbage collected away.

These should *not* happen during normal operations. "Normal
operations" is not a very precise concept. But for example, disk
errors are not expected to happen when the system is working, so those
count as Errors. However, if a TCP connection to a compute node is
lost, that is not considered an Error, because it doesn't affect the
pageserver's or safekeeper's operation in any way, and happens fairly
frequently when compute nodes are shut down, or are killed abruptly
because of errors in the compute.

**Errors are monitored, and always need human investigation to determine
the cause.**

Whether something should be logged at ERROR, WARNING or INFO level can
depend on the callers and clients. For example, it might be unexpected
and a sign of a serious issue if the console calls the
"timeline_detail" mgmt API for a timeline that doesn't exist. ERROR
would be appropriate in that case. But if the console routinely calls
the API after deleting a timeline, to check if the deletion has
completed, then it would be totally normal and an INFO or DEBUG level
message would be more appropriate. If a message is logged as an ERROR,
but it in fact happens frequently in production and never requires any
action, it should probably be demoted to an INFO level message.

### Warn

Examples:
- could not remove temporary file "foobar.temp"
- unrecognized file "foobar" in timeline directory

Warnings are similar to Errors, in that they should not happen
when the system is operating normally. The difference between Error and
Warning is that an Error means that the operation failed, whereas Warning
means that something unexpected happened, but the operation continued anyway.
For example, if deleting a file fails because the file already didn't exist,
it should be logged as Warning.

> **Note:** The python regression tests, under `test_regress`, check the
> pageserver log after each test for any ERROR and WARN lines. If there are
> any ERRORs or WARNs that have not been explicitly listed in the test as
> allowed, the test is marked a failed. This is to catch unexpected errors
> e.g. in background operations, that don't cause immediate misbehaviour in
> the tested functionality.

### Info

Info level is used to log useful information when the system is
operating normally. Info level is appropriate e.g. for logging state
changes, background operations, and network connections.

Examples:
- "system is shutting down"
- "tenant was created"
- "retrying S3 upload"

### Debug & Trace

Debug and Trace level messages are not printed to the log in our normal
production configuration, but could be enabled for a specific server or
tenant, to aid debugging. (Although we don't actually have that
capability as of this writing).

## Context

We use logging "spans" to hold context information about the current
operation. Almost every operation happens on a particular tenant and
timeline, so we enter a span with the "tenant_id" and "timeline_id"
very early when processing an incoming API request, for example. All
background operations should also run in a span containing at least
those two fields, and any other parameters or information that might
be useful when debugging an error that might happen when performing
the operation.

TODO: Spans are not captured in the Error when it is created, but when
the error is logged. It would be more useful to capture them at Error
creation. We should consider using `tracing_error::SpanTrace` to do
that.

## Error message style

### PostgreSQL extensions

PostgreSQL has a style guide for writing error messages:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/error-style-guide.html

Follow that guide when writing error messages in the PostgreSQL
extensions.

### Neon Rust code

#### Anyhow Context

When adding anyhow `context()`, use form `present-tense-verb+action`.

Example:
- Bad: `file.metadata().context("could not get file metadata")?;`
- Good: `file.metadata().context("get file metadata")?;`

#### Logging Errors

When logging any error `e`, use `could not {e:#}` or `failed to {e:#}`.

If `e` is an `anyhow` error and you want to log the backtrace that it contains,
use `{e:?}` instead of `{e:#}`.

#### Rationale

The `{:#}` ("alternate Display") of an `anyhow` error chain is concatenation fo the contexts, using `: `.

For example, the following Rust code will result in output
```
ERROR  failed to list users: load users from server: parse response: invalid json
```

This is more concise / less noisy than what happens if you do `.context("could not ...")?` at each level, i.e.:

```
ERROR  could not list users: could not load users from server: could not parse response: invalid json
```


```rust
fn main() {
  match list_users().context("list users") else {
    Ok(_) => ...,
    Err(e) => tracing::error!("failed to {e:#}"),
  }
}
fn list_users() {
  http_get_users().context("load users from server")?;
}
fn http_get_users() {
  let response = client....?;
  response.parse().context("parse response")?; // fails with serde error "invalid json"
}
```

# Glossary

### Authentication

### Backpressure

Backpressure is used to limit the lag between pageserver and compute node or WAL service.

If compute node or WAL service run far ahead of Page Server,
the time of serving page requests increases. This may lead to timeout errors.

To tune backpressure limits use `max_replication_write_lag`, `max_replication_flush_lag` and `max_replication_apply_lag` settings.
When lag between current LSN (pg_current_wal_flush_lsn() at compute node) and minimal write/flush/apply position of replica exceeds the limit
backends performing writes are blocked until the replica is caught up.
### Base image (page image)

### Basebackup

A tarball with files needed to bootstrap a compute node[] and a corresponding command to create it.
NOTE:It has nothing to do with PostgreSQL pg_basebackup.

### Branch

We can create branch at certain LSN using `neon_local timeline branch` command.
Each Branch lives in a corresponding timeline[] and has an ancestor[].


### Checkpoint (PostgreSQL)

NOTE: This is an overloaded term.

A checkpoint record in the WAL marks a point in the WAL sequence at which it is guaranteed that all data files have been updated with all information from shared memory modified before that checkpoint;

### Checkpoint (Layered repository)

NOTE: This is an overloaded term.

Whenever enough WAL has been accumulated in memory, the page server []
writes out the changes from the in-memory layer into a new delta layer file. This process
is called "checkpointing".

Configuration parameter `checkpoint_distance` defines the distance
from current LSN to perform checkpoint of in-memory layers.
Default is `DEFAULT_CHECKPOINT_DISTANCE`.

### Compaction

A background operation on layer files. Compaction takes a number of L0
layer files, each of which covers the whole key space and a range of
LSN, and reshuffles the data in them into L1 files so that each file
covers the whole LSN range, but only part of the key space.

Compaction should also opportunistically leave obsolete page versions
from the L1 files, and materialize other page versions for faster
access. That hasn't been implemented as of this writing, though.


### Compute node

Stateless Postgres node that stores data in pageserver.

### Garbage collection

The process of removing old on-disk layers that are not needed by any timeline anymore.

### Fork

Each of the separate segmented file sets in which a relation is stored. The main fork is where the actual data resides. There also exist two secondary forks for metadata: the free space map and the visibility map.

### Layer

A layer contains data needed to reconstruct any page versions within the
layer's Segment and range of LSNs.

There are two kinds of layers, in-memory and on-disk layers. In-memory
layers are used to ingest incoming WAL, and provide fast access
to the recent page versions. On-disk layers are stored as files on disk, and
are immutable. See [pageserver-storage.md](./pageserver-storage.md) for more.

### Layer file (on-disk layer)

Layered repository on-disk format is based on immutable files.  The
files are called "layer files". There are two kinds of layer files:
image files and delta files. An image file contains a "snapshot" of a
range of keys at a particular LSN, and a delta file contains WAL
records applicable to a range of keys, in a range of LSNs.

### Layer map

The layer map tracks what layers exist in a timeline.

### Layered repository

Neon repository implementation that keeps data in layers.

### LSN

The Log Sequence Number (LSN) is a unique identifier of the WAL record[] in the WAL log.
The insert position is a byte offset into the logs, increasing monotonically with each new record.
Internally, an LSN is a 64-bit integer, representing a byte position in the write-ahead log stream.
It is printed as two hexadecimal numbers of up to 8 digits each, separated by a slash.
Check also [PostgreSQL doc about pg_lsn type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/datatype-pg-lsn.html)
Values can be compared to calculate the volume of WAL data that separates them, so they are used to measure the progress of replication and recovery.

In Postgres and Neon LSNs are used to describe certain points in WAL handling.

PostgreSQL LSNs and functions to monitor them:
* `pg_current_wal_insert_lsn()` - Returns the current write-ahead log insert location.
* `pg_current_wal_lsn()` - Returns the current write-ahead log write location.
* `pg_current_wal_flush_lsn()` - Returns the current write-ahead log flush location.
* `pg_last_wal_receive_lsn()` - Returns the last write-ahead log location that has been received and synced to disk by streaming replication. While streaming replication is in progress this will increase monotonically.
* `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn ()` - Returns the last write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery. If recovery is still in progress this will increase monotonically.
[source PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/functions-admin.html):

Neon safekeeper LSNs. See [safekeeper protocol section](safekeeper-protocol.md) for more information.
* `CommitLSN`: position in WAL confirmed by quorum safekeepers.
* `RestartLSN`: position in WAL confirmed by all safekeepers.
* `FlushLSN`: part of WAL persisted to the disk by safekeeper.
* `VCL`: the largest LSN for which we can guarantee availability of all prior records.

Neon pageserver LSNs:
* `last_record_lsn` - the end of last processed WAL record.
* `disk_consistent_lsn` - data is known to be fully flushed and fsync'd to local disk on pageserver up to this LSN.
* `remote_consistent_lsn` - The last LSN that is synced to remote storage and is guaranteed to survive pageserver crash.
TODO: use this name consistently in remote storage code. Now `disk_consistent_lsn` is used and meaning depends on the context.
* `ancestor_lsn` - LSN of the branch point (the LSN at which this branch was created)

TODO: add table that describes mapping between PostgreSQL (compute), safekeeper and pageserver LSNs.

### Logical size

The pageserver tracks the "logical size" of a timeline. It is the
total size of all relations in all Postgres databases on the
timeline. It includes all user and system tables, including their FSM
and VM forks. But it does not include SLRUs, twophase files or any
other such data or metadata that lives outside relations.

The logical size is calculated by the pageserver, and is sent to
PostgreSQL via feedback messages to the safekeepers. PostgreSQL uses
the logical size to enforce the size limit in the free tier. The
logical size is also shown to users in the web console.

The logical size is not affected by branches or the physical layout of
layer files in the pageserver. If you have a database with 1 GB
logical size and you create a branch of it, both branches will have 1
GB logical size, even though the branch is copy-on-write and won't
consume any extra physical disk space until you make changes to it.

### Page (block)

The basic structure used to store relation data. All pages are of the same size.
This is the unit of data exchange between compute node and pageserver.

### Pageserver

Neon storage engine: repositories + wal receiver + page service + wal redo.

### Page service

The Page Service listens for GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes,
and responds with pages from the repository.


### PITR (Point-in-time-recovery)

PostgreSQL's ability to restore up to a specified LSN.

### Primary node


### Proxy

Postgres protocol proxy/router.
This service listens psql port, can check auth via external service
and create new databases and accounts (control plane API in our case).

### Relation

The generic term in PostgreSQL for all objects in a database that have a name and a list of attributes defined in a specific order.

### Replication slot


### Replica node


### Repository

Repository stores multiple timelines, forked off from the same initial call to 'initdb'
and has associated WAL redo service.
One repository corresponds to one Tenant.

### Retention policy

How much history do we need to keep around for PITR and read-only nodes?

### Segment

A physical file that stores data for a given relation. File segments are
limited in size by a compile-time setting (1 gigabyte by default), so if a
relation exceeds that size, it is split into multiple segments.

### SLRU

SLRUs include pg_clog, pg_multixact/members, and
pg_multixact/offsets. There are other SLRUs in PostgreSQL, but
they don't need to be stored permanently (e.g. pg_subtrans),
or we do not support them in neon yet (pg_commit_ts).

### Tenant (Multitenancy)
Tenant represents a single customer, interacting with Neon.
Wal redo[] activity, timelines[], layers[] are managed for each tenant independently.
One pageserver[] can serve multiple tenants at once.
One safekeeper

See `docs/multitenancy.md` for more.

### Timeline

Timeline accepts page changes and serves get_page_at_lsn() and
get_rel_size() requests. The term "timeline" is used internally
in the system, but to users they are exposed as "branches", with
human-friendly names.

NOTE: this has nothing to do with PostgreSQL WAL timelines.

### XLOG

PostgreSQL alias for WAL[].

### WAL (Write-ahead log)

The journal that keeps track of the changes in the database cluster as user- and system-invoked operations take place. It comprises many individual WAL records[] written sequentially to WAL files[].

### WAL acceptor, WAL proposer

In the context of the consensus algorithm, the Postgres
compute node is also known as the WAL proposer, and the safekeeper is also known
as the acceptor. Those are the standard terms in the Paxos algorithm.

### WAL receiver (WAL decoder)

The WAL receiver connects to the external WAL safekeeping service (or
directly to the primary) using PostgreSQL physical streaming
replication, and continuously receives WAL. It decodes the WAL records,
and stores them to the repository.

We keep one WAL receiver active per timeline.

### WAL record

A low-level description of an individual data change.

### WAL redo

A service that runs PostgreSQL in a special wal_redo mode
to apply given WAL records over an old page image and return new page image.

### WAL safekeeper

One node that participates in the quorum. All the safekeepers
together form the WAL service.

### WAL segment (WAL file)

Also known as WAL segment or WAL segment file. Each of the sequentially-numbered files that provide storage space for WAL. The files are all of the same predefined size and are written in sequential order, interspersing changes as they occur in multiple simultaneous sessions.

### WAL service

The service as whole that ensures that WAL is stored durably.

### Web console



# Content from file ../neon/docs/multitenancy.md:

## Multitenancy

### Overview

Neon supports multitenancy. One pageserver can serve multiple tenants at once. Tenants can be managed via neon_local CLI. During page server setup tenant can be created using ```neon_local init --create-tenant``` Also tenants can be added into the system on the fly without pageserver restart. This can be done using the following cli command: ```neon_local tenant create``` Tenants use random identifiers which can be represented as a 32 symbols hexadecimal string. So neon_local tenant create accepts desired tenant id as an optional argument. The concept of timelines/branches is working independently per tenant.

### Tenants in other commands

By default during `neon_local init` new tenant is created on the pageserver. Newly created tenant's id is saved to cli config, so other commands can use it automatically if no direct argument `--tenant_id=<tenant_id>` is provided. So generally tenant_id more frequently appears in internal pageserver interface. Its commands take tenant_id argument to distinguish to which tenant operation should be applied. CLI support creation of new tenants.

Examples for cli:

```sh
neon_local tenant list

neon_local tenant create // generates new id

### Data layout

On the page server tenants introduce one level of indirection, so data directory structured the following way:
```
<pageserver working directory>
├── pageserver.log
├── pageserver.pid
├── pageserver.toml
└── tenants
   ├── 537cffa58a4fa557e49e19951b5a9d6b
   ├── de182bc61fb11a5a6b390a8aed3a804a
   └── ee6016ec31116c1b7c33dfdfca38891f
```
Wal redo activity and timelines are managed for each tenant independently.

For local environment used for example in tests there also new level of indirection for tenants. It touches `pgdatadirs` directory. Now it contains `tenants` subdirectory so the structure looks the following way:

```
pgdatadirs
└── tenants
   ├── de182bc61fb11a5a6b390a8aed3a804a
   │  └── main
   └── ee6016ec31116c1b7c33dfdfca38892f
      └── main
```

### Changes to postgres

Tenant id is passed to postgres via GUC the same way as the timeline. Tenant id is added to commands issued to pageserver, namely: pagestream, callmemaybe. Tenant id is also exists in ServerInfo structure, this is needed to pass the value to wal receiver to be able to forward it to the pageserver.

### Safety

For now particular tenant can only appear on a particular pageserver. Set of safekeepers are also pinned to particular (tenant_id, timeline_id) pair so there can only be one writer for particular (tenant_id, timeline_id).

The Page Service listens for GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes,
and responds with pages from the repository. On each GetPage@LSN request,
it calls into the Repository function

A separate thread is spawned for each incoming connection to the page
service. The page service uses the libpq protocol to communicate with
the client. The client is a Compute Postgres instance.

## Page Service

The Page Service listens for GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes,
and responds with pages from the repository. On each GetPage@LSN request,
it calls into the Repository function

A separate thread is spawned for each incoming connection to the page
service. The page service uses the libpq protocol to communicate with
the client. The client is a Compute Postgres instance.

## WAL Receiver

The WAL receiver connects to the external WAL safekeeping service
using PostgreSQL physical streaming replication, and continuously
receives WAL. It decodes the WAL records, and stores them to the
repository.


## Backup service

The backup service, responsible for storing pageserver recovery data externally.

Currently, pageserver stores its files in a filesystem directory it's pointed to.
That working directory could be rather ephemeral for such cases as "a pageserver pod running in k8s with no persistent volumes attached".
Therefore, the server interacts with external, more reliable storage to back up and restore its state.

The code for storage support is extensible and can support arbitrary ones as long as they implement a certain Rust trait.
There are the following implementations present:
* local filesystem — to use in tests mainly
* AWS S3           - to use in production

The backup service is disabled by default and can be enabled to interact with a single remote storage.

CLI examples:
* Local FS: `${PAGESERVER_BIN} -c "remote_storage={local_path='/some/local/path/'}"`
* AWS S3  : `env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='SOMEKEYAAAAASADSAH*#' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='SOMEsEcReTsd292v' ${PAGESERVER_BIN} -c "remote_storage={bucket_name='some-sample-bucket',bucket_region='eu-north-1', prefix_in_bucket='/test_prefix/'}"`

For Amazon AWS S3, a key id and secret access key could be located in `~/.aws/credentials` if awscli was ever configured to work with the desired bucket, on the AWS Settings page for a certain user. Also note, that the bucket names does not contain any protocols when used on AWS.
For local S3 installations, refer to the their documentation for name format and credentials.

Similar to other pageserver settings, toml config file can be used to configure either of the storages as backup targets.
Required sections are:

```toml
[remote_storage]
local_path = '/Users/someonetoignore/Downloads/tmp_dir/'
```

or

```toml
[remote_storage]
bucket_name = 'some-sample-bucket'
bucket_region = 'eu-north-1'
prefix_in_bucket = '/test_prefix/'
```

`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` env variables can be used to specify the S3 credentials if needed.

or

```toml
[remote_storage]
container_name = 'some-container-name'
storage_account = 'somestorageaccnt'
container_region = 'us-east'
prefix_in_container = '/test-prefix/'
```

The `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` env variable can be used to specify the azure credentials if needed.

## Repository background tasks

The Repository also has a few different background threads and tokio tasks that perform
background duties like dumping accumulated WAL data from memory to disk, reorganizing
files for performance (compaction), and garbage collecting old files.


Repository
----------

The repository stores all the page versions, or WAL records needed to
reconstruct them. Each tenant has a separate Repository, which is
stored in the .neon/tenants/<tenant_id> directory.

Repository is an abstract trait, defined in `repository.rs`. It is
implemented by the LayeredRepository object in
`layered_repository.rs`. There is only that one implementation of the
Repository trait, but it's still a useful abstraction that keeps the
interface for the low-level storage functionality clean. The layered
storage format is described in [pageserver-storage.md](./pageserver-storage.md).

Each repository consists of multiple Timelines. Timeline is a
workhorse that accepts page changes from the WAL, and serves
get_page_at_lsn() and get_rel_size() requests. Note: this has nothing
to do with PostgreSQL WAL timeline. The term "timeline" is mostly
interchangeable with "branch", there is a one-to-one mapping from
branch to timeline. A timeline has a unique ID within the tenant,
represented as 16-byte hex string that never changes, whereas a
branch is a user-given name for a timeline.

Each repository also has a WAL redo manager associated with it, see
`walredo.rs`. The WAL redo manager is used to replay PostgreSQL WAL
records, whenever we need to reconstruct a page version from WAL to
satisfy a GetPage@LSN request, or to avoid accumulating too much WAL
for a page. The WAL redo manager uses a Postgres process running in
special Neon wal-redo mode to do the actual WAL redo, and
communicates with the process using a pipe.


Checkpointing / Garbage Collection
----------------------------------

Periodically, the checkpointer thread wakes up and performs housekeeping
duties on the repository. It has two duties:

### Checkpointing

Flush WAL that has accumulated in memory to disk, so that the old WAL
can be truncated away in the WAL safekeepers. Also, to free up memory
for receiving new WAL. This process is called "checkpointing". It's
similar to checkpointing in PostgreSQL or other DBMSs, but in the page
server, checkpointing happens on a per-segment basis.

### Garbage collection

Remove old on-disk layer files that are no longer needed according to the
PITR retention policy



TODO: Sharding
--------------------

We should be able to run multiple Page Servers that handle sharded data.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/pageserver-storage.md:

# Pageserver storage

The main responsibility of the Page Server is to process the incoming WAL, and
reprocess it into a format that allows reasonably quick access to any page
version. The page server slices the incoming WAL per relation and page, and
packages the sliced WAL into suitably-sized "layer files". The layer files
contain all the history of the database, back to some reasonable retention
period. This system replaces the base backups and the WAL archive used in a
traditional PostgreSQL installation. The layer files are immutable, they are not
modified in-place after creation. New layer files are created for new incoming
WAL, and old layer files are removed when they are no longer needed.

The on-disk format is based on immutable files. The page server receives a
stream of incoming WAL, parses the WAL records to determine which pages they
apply to, and accumulates the incoming changes in memory. Whenever enough WAL
has been accumulated in memory, it is written out to a new immutable file. That
process accumulates "L0 delta files" on disk. When enough L0 files have been
accumulated, they are merged and re-partitioned into L1 files, and old files
that are no longer needed are removed by Garbage Collection (GC).

The incoming WAL contains updates to arbitrary pages in the system. The
distribution depends on the workload: the updates could be totally random, or
there could be a long stream of updates to a single relation when data is bulk
loaded, for example, or something in between.

|EEEE|               |EEEE|EEEE|      +---+-----+
+----+               +----+----+
```

In this illustration, WAL is received as a stream from the Safekeeper, from the
right.  It is immediately captured by the page server and stored quickly in
memory. The page server memory can be thought of as a quick "reorder buffer",
used to hold the incoming WAL and reorder it so that we keep the WAL records for
the same page and relation close to each other.

From the page server memory, whenever enough WAL has been accumulated, it is flushed
to disk into a new L0 layer file, and the memory is released.

When enough L0 files have been accumulated, they are merged together and sliced
per key-space, producing a new set of files where each file contains a more
narrow key range, but larger LSN range.

From the local disk, the layers are further copied to Cloud Storage, for
long-term archival. After a layer has been copied to Cloud Storage, it can be
removed from local disk, although we currently keep everything locally for fast
access. If a layer is needed that isn't found locally, it is fetched from Cloud
Storage and stored in local disk. L0 and L1 files are both uploaded to Cloud
Storage.

# Layer map

The LayerMap tracks what layers exist in a timeline.

Currently, the layer map is just a resizable array (Vec). On a GetPage@LSN or
other read request, the layer map scans through the array to find the right layer
that contains the data for the requested page. The read-code in LayeredTimeline
is aware of the ancestor, and returns data from the ancestor timeline if it's
not found on the current timeline.

# Different kinds of layers

A layer can be in different states:

- Open - a layer where new WAL records can be appended to.
- Closed - a layer that is read-only, no new WAL records can be appended to it
- Historic: synonym for closed
- InMemory: A layer that needs to be rebuilt from WAL on pageserver start.
To avoid OOM errors, InMemory layers can be spilled to disk into ephemeral file.
- OnDisk: A layer that is stored on disk. If its end-LSN is older than
  disk_consistent_lsn, it is known to be fully flushed and fsync'd to local disk.
- Frozen layer: an in-memory layer that is Closed.

TODO: Clarify the difference between Closed, Historic and Frozen.

There are two kinds of OnDisk layers:
- ImageLayer represents a snapshot of all the keys in a particular range, at one
  particular LSN. Any keys that are not present in the ImageLayer are known not
  to exist at that LSN.
- DeltaLayer represents a collection of WAL records or page images in a range of
  LSNs, for a range of keys.

# Layer life cycle

LSN range defined by start_lsn and end_lsn:
- start_lsn is inclusive.
- end_lsn is exclusive.

For an open in-memory layer, the end_lsn is MAX_LSN. For a frozen in-memory
layer or a delta layer, it is a valid end bound. An image layer represents
snapshot at one LSN, so end_lsn is always the snapshot LSN + 1

Every layer starts its life as an Open In-Memory layer. When the page server
receives the first WAL record for a timeline, it creates a new In-Memory layer
for it, and puts it to the layer map. Later, when the layer becomes full, its
contents are written to disk, as an on-disk layers.

Flushing a layer is a two-step process: First, the layer is marked as closed, so
that it no longer accepts new WAL records, and a new in-memory layer is created
to hold any WAL after that point. After this first step, the layer is a Closed
InMemory state. This first step is called "freezing" the layer.

In the second step, a new Delta layers is created, containing all the data from
the Frozen InMemory layer. When it has been created and flushed to disk, the
original frozen layer is replaced with the new layers in the layer map, and the
original frozen layer is dropped, releasing the memory.

# Layer files (On-disk layers)

The files are called "layer files". Each layer file covers a range of keys, and
a range of LSNs (or a single LSN, in case of image layers). You can think of it
as a rectangle in the two-dimensional key-LSN space. The layer files for each
timeline are stored in the timeline's subdirectory under
`.neon/tenants/<tenant_id>/timelines`.

There are two kind of layer files: images, and delta layers. An image file
contains a snapshot of all keys at a particular LSN, whereas a delta file
contains modifications to a segment - mostly in the form of WAL records - in a
range of LSN.

image file:

```
    000000067F000032BE0000400000000070B6-000000067F000032BE0000400000000080B6__00000000346BC568
              start key                          end key                           LSN
```


The first parts define the key range that the layer covers. See
pgdatadir_mapping.rs for how the key space is used. The last part is the LSN.

delta file:

Delta files are named similarly, but they cover a range of LSNs:

```
    000000067F000032BE0000400000000020B6-000000067F000032BE0000400000000030B6__000000578C6B29-0000000057A50051
              start key                          end key                          start LSN     end LSN
```

A delta file contains all the key-values in the key-range that were updated in
the LSN range. If a key has not been modified, there is no trace of it in the
delta layer.


A delta layer file can cover a part of the overall key space, as in the previous
example, or the whole key range like this:

```
    000000000000000000000000000000000000-FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF__000000578C6B29-0000000057A50051
```

A file that covers the whole key range is called a L0 file (Level 0), while a
file that covers only part of the key range is called a L1 file. The "level" of
a file is not explicitly stored anywhere, you can only distinguish them by
looking at the key range that a file covers. The read-path doesn't need to
treat L0 and L1 files any differently.


## Notation used in this document

FIXME: This is somewhat obsolete, the layer files cover a key-range rather than
a particular relation nowadays. However, the description on how you find a page
version, and how branching and GC works is still valid.

The full path of a delta file looks like this:

```
    .neon/tenants/941ddc8604413b88b3d208bddf90396c/timelines/4af489b06af8eed9e27a841775616962/rel_1663_13990_2609_0_10_000000000169C348_0000000001702000
```

For simplicity, the examples below use a simplified notation for the
paths.  The tenant ID is left out, the timeline ID is replaced with
the human-readable branch name, and spcnode+dbnode+relnode+forkum+segno
with a human-readable table name. The LSNs are also shorter. For
example, a base image file at LSN 100 and a delta file between 100-200
for 'orders' table on 'main' branch is represented like this:

```
    main/orders_100
    main/orders_100_200
```


# Creating layer files

Let's start with a simple example with a system that contains one
branch called 'main' and two tables, 'orders' and 'customers'. The end
of WAL is currently at LSN 250. In this starting situation, you would
have these files on disk:

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/customers_100
	main/customers_100_200
	main/customers_200
```

In addition to those files, the recent changes between LSN 200 and the
end of WAL at 250 are kept in memory. If the page server crashes, the
latest records between 200-250 need to be re-read from the WAL.

Whenever enough WAL has been accumulated in memory, the page server
writes out the changes in memory into new layer files. This process
is called "checkpointing" (not to be confused with the PostgreSQL
checkpoints, that's a different thing). The page server only creates
layer files for relations that have been modified since the last
checkpoint. For example, if the current end of WAL is at LSN 450, and
the last checkpoint happened at LSN 400 but there hasn't been any
recent changes to 'customers' table, you would have these files on
disk:

	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400
	main/customers_100
	main/customers_100_200
	main/customers_200

If the customers table is modified later, a new file is created for it
at the next checkpoint. The new file will cover the "gap" from the
last layer file, so the LSN ranges are always contiguous:

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400
	main/customers_100
	main/customers_100_200
	main/customers_200
	main/customers_200_500
	main/customers_500
```

## Reading page versions

Whenever a GetPage@LSN request comes in from the compute node, the
page server needs to reconstruct the requested page, as it was at the
requested LSN. To do that, the page server first checks the recent
in-memory layer; if the requested page version is found there, it can
be returned immediately without looking at the files on
disk. Otherwise the page server needs to locate the layer file that
contains the requested page version.

For example, if a request comes in for table 'orders' at LSN 250, the
page server would load the 'main/orders_200_300' file into memory, and
reconstruct and return the requested page from it, as it was at
LSN 250. Because the layer file consists of a full image of the
relation at the start LSN and the WAL, reconstructing the page
involves replaying any WAL records applicable to the page between LSNs
200-250, starting from the base image at LSN 200.

# Multiple branches

Imagine that a child branch is created at LSN 250:

```
            @250
    ----main--+-------------------------->
               \
                +---child-------------->
```


Then, the 'orders' table is updated differently on the 'main' and
'child' branches. You now have this situation on disk:

```
    main/orders_100
    main/orders_100_200
    main/orders_200
    main/orders_200_300
    main/orders_300
    main/orders_300_400
    main/orders_400
    main/customers_100
    main/customers_100_200
    main/customers_200
    child/orders_250_300
    child/orders_300
    child/orders_300_400
    child/orders_400
```

Because the 'customers' table hasn't been modified on the child
branch, there is no file for it there. If you request a page for it on
the 'child' branch, the page server will not find any layer file
for it in the 'child' directory, so it will recurse to look into the
parent 'main' branch instead.

From the 'child' branch's point of view, the history for each relation
is linear, and the request's LSN identifies unambiguously which file
you need to look at. For example, the history for the 'orders' table
on the 'main' branch consists of these files:

```
    main/orders_100
    main/orders_100_200
    main/orders_200
    main/orders_200_300
    main/orders_300
    main/orders_300_400
    main/orders_400
```

And from the 'child' branch's point of view, it consists of these
files:

```
    main/orders_100
    main/orders_100_200
    main/orders_200
    main/orders_200_300
    child/orders_250_300
    child/orders_300
    child/orders_300_400
    child/orders_400
```

The branch metadata includes the point where the child branch was
created, LSN 250. If a page request comes with LSN 275, we read the
page version from the 'child/orders_250_300' file. We might also
need to reconstruct the page version as it was at LSN 250, in order
to replay the WAL up to LSN 275, using 'main/orders_200_300' and
'main/orders_200'. The page versions between 250-300 in the
'main/orders_200_300' file are ignored when operating on the child
branch.

Note: It doesn't make any difference if the child branch is created
when the end of the main branch was at LSN 250, or later when the tip of
the main branch had already moved on. The latter case, creating a
branch at a historic LSN, is how we support PITR in Neon.


# Garbage collection

In this scheme, we keep creating new layer files over time. We also
need a mechanism to remove old files that are no longer needed,
because disk space isn't infinite.

What files are still needed? Currently, the page server supports PITR
and branching from any branch at any LSN that is "recent enough" from
the tip of the branch.  "Recent enough" is defined as an LSN horizon,
which by default is 64 MB.  (See DEFAULT_GC_HORIZON). For this
example, let's assume that the LSN horizon is 150 units.

Let's look at the single branch scenario again. Imagine that the end
of the branch is LSN 525, so that the GC horizon is currently at
525-150 = 375

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400
	main/orders_400_500
	main/orders_500
	main/customers_100
	main/customers_100_200
	main/customers_200
```

We can remove the following files because the end LSNs of those files are
older than GC horizon 375, and there are more recent layer files for the
table:

```
	main/orders_100       DELETE
	main/orders_100_200   DELETE
	main/orders_200       DELETE
	main/orders_200_300   DELETE
	main/orders_300       STILL NEEDED BY orders_300_400
	main/orders_300_400   KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/orders_400       ..
	main/orders_400_500   ..
	main/orders_500       ..
	main/customers_100      DELETE
	main/customers_100_200  DELETE
	main/customers_200      KEEP, NO NEWER VERSION
```

'main/customers_200' is old enough, but it cannot be
removed because there is no newer layer file for the table.

Things get slightly more complicated with multiple branches. All of
the above still holds, but in addition to recent files we must also
retain older snapshot files that are still needed by child branches.
For example, if child branch is created at LSN 150, and the 'customers'
table is updated on the branch, you would have these files:

```
	main/orders_100        KEEP, NEEDED BY child BRANCH
	main/orders_100_200    KEEP, NEEDED BY child BRANCH
	main/orders_200        DELETE
	main/orders_200_300    DELETE
	main/orders_300        KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/orders_300_400    KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/orders_400        KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/orders_400_500    KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/orders_500        KEEP, NEWER THAN GC HORIZON
	main/customers_100       DELETE
	main/customers_100_200   DELETE
	main/customers_200       KEEP, NO NEWER VERSION
	child/customers_150_300  DELETE
	child/customers_300      KEEP, NO NEWER VERSION
```

In this situation, 'main/orders_100' and 'main/orders_100_200' cannot
be removed, even though they are older than the GC horizon, because
they are still needed by the child branch. 'main/orders_200'
and 'main/orders_200_300' can still be removed.

If 'orders' is modified later on the 'child' branch, we will create a
new base image and delta file for it on the child:

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200

	main/orders_300
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400
	main/orders_400_500
	main/orders_500
	main/customers_200
	child/customers_300
	child/orders_150_400
	child/orders_400
```

After this, the 'main/orders_100' and 'main/orders_100_200' file could
be removed. It is no longer needed by the child branch, because there
is a newer layer file there. TODO: This optimization hasn't been
implemented! The GC algorithm will currently keep the file on the
'main' branch anyway, for as long as the child branch exists.

TODO:
Describe GC and checkpoint interval settings.

# TODO: On LSN ranges

In principle, each relation can be checkpointed separately, i.e. the
LSN ranges of the files don't need to line up. So this would be legal:

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400
	main/customers_150
	main/customers_150_250
	main/customers_250
	main/customers_250_500
	main/customers_500
```

However, the code currently always checkpoints all relations together.
So that situation doesn't arise in practice.

It would also be OK to have overlapping LSN ranges for the same relation:

	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
	main/orders_250_350
	main/orders_350
	main/orders_300_400
	main/orders_400

The code that reads the layer files should cope with this, but this
situation doesn't arise either, because the checkpointing code never
does that.  It could be useful, however, as a transient state when
garbage collecting around branch points, or explicit recovery
points. For example, if we start with this:

```
	main/orders_100
	main/orders_100_200
	main/orders_200
	main/orders_200_300
	main/orders_300
```

And there is a branch or explicit recovery point at LSN 150, we could
replace 'main/orders_100_200' with 'main/orders_150' to keep a
layer only at that exact point that's still needed, removing the
other page versions around it. But such compaction has not been
implemented yet.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/pageserver-tenant-migration.md:

## Pageserver tenant migration

### Overview

This feature allows to migrate a timeline from one pageserver to another by utilizing remote storage capability.

### Migration process

Pageserver implements two new http handlers: timeline attach and timeline detach.
Timeline migration is performed in a following way:
1. Timeline attach is called on a target pageserver. This asks pageserver to download latest checkpoint uploaded to s3.
2. For now it is necessary to manually initialize replication stream via callmemaybe call so target pageserver initializes replication from safekeeper (it is desired to avoid this and initialize replication directly in attach handler, but this requires some refactoring (probably [#997](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/997)/[#1049](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1049))
3. Replication state can be tracked via timeline detail pageserver call.
4. Compute node should be restarted with new pageserver connection string. Issue with multiple compute nodes for one timeline is handled on the safekeeper consensus level. So this is not a problem here.Currently responsibility for rescheduling the compute with updated config lies on external coordinator (console).
5. Timeline is detached from old pageserver. On disk data is removed.


### Implementation details

Now safekeeper needs to track which pageserver it is replicating to. This introduces complications into replication code:
* We need to distinguish different pageservers (now this is done by connection string which is imperfect and is covered here: https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1105). Callmemaybe subscription management also needs to track that (this is already implemented).
* We need to track which pageserver is the primary. This is needed to avoid reconnections to non primary pageservers. Because we shouldn't reconnect to them when they decide to stop their walreceiver. I e this can appear when there is a load on the compute and we are trying to detach timeline from old pageserver. In this case callmemaybe will try to reconnect to it because replication termination condition is not met (page server with active compute could never catch up to the latest lsn, so there is always some wal tail)


# Content from file ../neon/docs/pageserver-thread-mgmt.md:

## Thread management

The pageserver uses Tokio for handling concurrency. Everything runs in
Tokio tasks, although some parts are written in blocking style and use
spawn_blocking().

We currently use std blocking functions for disk I/O, however.  The
current model is that we consider disk I/Os to be short enough that we
perform them while running in a Tokio task. Changing all the disk I/O
calls to async is a TODO.

Each Tokio task is tracked by the `task_mgr` module. It maintains a
registry of tasks, and which tenant or timeline they are operating
on.

### Handling shutdown

When a tenant or timeline is deleted, we need to shut down all tasks
operating on it, before deleting the data on disk. There's a function,
`shutdown_tasks`, to request all tasks of a particular tenant or
timeline to shutdown. It will also wait for them to finish.

A task registered in the task registry can check if it has been
requested to shut down, by calling `is_shutdown_requested()`. There's
also a `shutdown_watcher()` Future that can be used with `tokio::select!`
or similar, to wake up on shutdown.


### Async cancellation safety

In async Rust, futures can be "cancelled" at any await point, by
dropping the Future. For example, `tokio::select!` returns as soon as
one of the Futures returns, and drops the others. `tokio::time::timeout`
is another example. In the Rust ecosystem, some functions are
cancellation-safe, meaning they can be safely dropped without
side-effects, while others are not. See documentation of
`tokio::select!` for examples.

In the pageserver and safekeeper, async code is *not*
cancellation-safe by default. Unless otherwise marked, any async
function that you call cannot be assumed to be async
cancellation-safe, and must be polled to completion.

The downside of non-cancellation safe code is that you have to be very
careful when using `tokio::select!`, `tokio::time::timeout`, and other
such functions that can cause a Future to be dropped. They can only be
used with functions that are explicitly documented to be cancellation-safe,
or you need to spawn a separate task to shield from the cancellation.

At the entry points to the code, we also take care to poll futures to
completion, or shield the rest of the code from surprise cancellations
by spawning a separate task. The code that handles incoming HTTP
requests, for example, spawns a separate task for each request,
because Hyper will drop the request-handling Future if the HTTP
connection is lost.


#### How to cancel, then?

If our code is not cancellation-safe, how do you cancel long-running
tasks? Use CancellationTokens.

TODO: More details on that. And we have an ongoing discussion on what
to do if cancellations might come from multiple sources.

#### Exceptions
Some library functions are cancellation-safe, and are explicitly marked
as such. For example, `utils::seqwait`.

#### Rationale

The alternative would be to make all async code cancellation-safe,
unless otherwise marked. That way, you could use `tokio::select!` more
liberally. The reasons we didn't choose that are explained in this
section.

Writing code in a cancellation-safe manner is tedious, as you need to
scrutinize every `.await` and ensure that if the `.await` call never
returns, the system is in a safe, consistent state. In some ways, you
need to do that with `?` and early `returns`, too, but `.await`s are
easier to miss. It is also easier to perform cleanup tasks when a
function returns an `Err` than when an `.await` simply never
returns. You can use `scopeguard` and Drop guards to perform cleanup
tasks, but it is more tedious. An `.await` that never returns is more
similar to a panic.

Note that even if you only use building blocks that themselves are
cancellation-safe, it doesn't mean that the code as whole is
cancellation-safe. For example, consider the following code:

```
while let Some(i) = work_inbox.recv().await {
	if let Err(_) = results_outbox.send(i).await {
		println!("receiver dropped");
		return;
		}
	}
}
```

It reads messages from one channel, sends them to another channel. If
this code is cancelled at the `results_outbox.send(i).await`, the
message read from the receiver is lost. That may or may not be OK,
depending on the context.

Another reason to not require cancellation-safety is historical: we
already had a lot of async code that was not scrutinized for
cancellation-safety when this issue was raised. Scrutinizing all
existing code is no fun.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/pageserver-walredo.md:

# WAL Redo

To reconstruct a particular page version from an image of the page and
some WAL records, the pageserver needs to replay the WAL records. This
happens on-demand, when a GetPage@LSN request comes in, or as part of
background jobs that reorganize data for faster access.

It's important that data cannot leak from one tenant to another, and
that a corrupt WAL record on one timeline doesn't affect other tenants
or timelines.

## Multi-tenant security

If you have direct access to the WAL directory, or if you have
superuser access to a running PostgreSQL server, it's easy to
construct a malicious or corrupt WAL record that causes the WAL redo
functions to crash, or to execute arbitrary code. That is not a
security problem for PostgreSQL; if you have superuser access, you
have full access to the system anyway.

The Neon pageserver, however, is multi-tenant. It needs to execute WAL
belonging to different tenants in the same system, and malicious WAL
in one tenant must not affect other tenants.

A separate WAL redo process is launched for each tenant, and the
process uses the seccomp(2) system call to restrict its access to the
bare minimum needed to replay WAL records. The process does not have
access to the filesystem or network. It can only communicate with the
parent pageserver process through a pipe.

If an attacker creates a malicious WAL record and injects it into the
WAL stream of a timeline, he can take control of the WAL redo process
in the pageserver. However, the WAL redo process cannot access the
rest of the system. And because there is a separate WAL redo process
for each tenant, the hijacked WAL redo process can only see WAL and
data belonging to the same tenant, which the attacker would have
access to anyway.

## WAL-redo process communication

The WAL redo process runs the 'postgres' executable, launched with a
Neon-specific command-line option to put it into WAL-redo process
mode.  The pageserver controls the lifetime of the WAL redo processes,
launching them as needed. If a tenant is detached from the pageserver,
any WAL redo processes for that tenant are killed.

The pageserver communicates with each WAL redo process over its
stdin/stdout/stderr. It works in request-response model with a simple
custom protocol, described in walredo.rs. To replay a set of WAL
records for a page, the pageserver sends the "before" image of the
page and the WAL records over 'stdin', followed by a command to
perform the replay. The WAL redo process responds with an "after"
image of the page.

## Special handling of some records

Some WAL record types are handled directly in the pageserver, by
bespoken Rust code, and are not sent over to the WAL redo process.
This includes SLRU-related WAL records, like commit records. SLRUs
don't use the standard Postgres buffer manager, so dealing with them
in the Neon WAL redo mode would require quite a few changes to
Postgres code and special handling in the protocol anyway.

Some record types that include a full-page-image (e.g. XLOG_FPI) are
also handled specially when incoming WAL is processed already, and are
stored as page images rather than WAL records.


## Records that modify multiple pages

Some Postgres WAL records modify multiple pages. Such WAL records are
duplicated, so that a copy is stored for each affected page. This is
somewhat wasteful, but because most WAL records only affect one page,
the overhead is acceptable.

The WAL redo always happens for one particular page. If the WAL record
contains changes to other pages, they are ignored.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/pageserver.md:

# Page server architecture

The Page Server has a few different duties:

- Respond to GetPage@LSN requests from the Compute Nodes
- Receive WAL from WAL safekeeper, and store it
- Upload data to S3 to make it durable, download files from S3 as needed

S3 is the main fault-tolerant storage of all data, as there are no Page Server
replicas. We use a separate fault-tolerant WAL service to reduce latency. It
keeps track of WAL records which are not synced to S3 yet.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/002-storage.md:

# Neon storage node — alternative

## **Design considerations**

Simplify storage operations for people => Gain adoption/installs on laptops and small private installation => Attract customers to DBaaS by seamless integration between our tooling and cloud.

Proposed architecture addresses:

- High availability -- tolerates n/2 - 1 failures
- Multi-tenancy -- one storage for all databases
- Elasticity -- increase storage size on the go by adding nodes
- Snapshots / backups / PITR with S3 offload
- Compression

Minuses are:

- Quite a lot of work
- Single page access may touch few disk pages
- Some bloat in data — may slowdown sequential scans

## **Summary**

Storage cluster is sharded key-value store with ordered keys. Key (****page_key****) is a tuple of `(pg_id, db_id, timeline_id, rel_id, forkno, segno, pageno, lsn)`. Value is either page or page diff/wal. Each chunk (chunk == shard) stores approx 50-100GB ~~and automatically splits in half when grows bigger then soft 100GB limit~~. by having a fixed range of pageno's it is responsible for. Chunks placement on storage nodes is stored in a separate metadata service, so chunk can be freely moved around the cluster if it is need. Chunk itself is a filesystem directory with following sub directories:

```

|-chunk_42/
  |-store/ -- contains lsm with pages/pagediffs ranging from
  |	      page_key_lo to page_key_hi
  |-wal/
  |  |- db_1234/ db-specific wal files with pages from page_key_lo
  |		 to page_key_hi
  |
  |-chunk.meta -- small file with snapshot references
		  (page_key_prefix+lsn+name)
		  and PITR regions (page_key_start, page_key_end)
```

## **Chunk**

Chunk is responsible for storing pages potentially from different databases and relations. Each page is addressed by a lexicographically ordered tuple (****page_key****) with following fields:

- `pg_id` -- unique id of given postgres instance (or postgres cluster as it is called in postgres docs)
- `db_id` -- database that was created by 'CREATE DATABASE' in a given postgres instance
- `db_timeline` -- used to create Copy-on-Write instances from snapshots, described later
- `rel_id` -- tuple of (relation_id, 0) for tables and (indexed_relation_id, rel_id) for indices. Done this way so table indices were closer to table itself on our global key space.
- `(forkno, segno, pageno)` -- page coordinates in postgres data files
- `lsn_timeline` -- postgres feature, increments when PITR was done.
- `lsn` -- lsn of current page version.

Chunk stores pages and page diffs ranging from page_key_lo to page_key_hi. Processing node looks at page in wal record and sends record to a chunk responsible for this page range. When wal record arrives to a chunk it is initially stored in `chunk_id/wal/db_id/wal_segno.wal`. Then background process moves records from that wal files to the lsm tree in `chunk_id/store`. Or, more precisely, wal records would be materialized into lsm memtable and when that memtable is flushed to SSTable on disk we may trim the wal. That way some not durably (in the distributed sense) committed pages may enter the tree -- here we rely on processing node behavior: page request from processing node should contain proper lsm horizons so that storage node may respond with proper page version.

LSM here is a usual LSM for variable-length values: at first data is stored in memory (we hold incoming wal records to be able to regenerate it after restart) at some balanced tree. When this tree grows big enough we dump it into disk file (SSTable) sorting records by key. Then SStables are mergesorted in the background to a different files. All file operation are sequential and do not require WAL for durability.

Content of SSTable can be following:

```jsx
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=100) (full 8k page data)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=150) (per-page diff)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=180) (per-page diff)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=200) (per-page diff)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=220) (full 8k page data)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=250) (per-page diff)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=42, lsn=270) (per-page diff)
(pg_id, db_id, ... , pageno=5000, lsn=100) (full 8k page data)
```

So query for `pageno=42 up to lsn=260` would need to find closest entry less then this key, iterate back to the latest full page and iterate forward to apply diffs. How often page is materialized in lsn-version sequence is up to us -- let's say each 5th version should be a full page.

### **Page deletion**

To delete old pages we insert blind deletion marker `(pg_id, db_id, #trim_lsn < 150)` into a lsm tree. During merges such marker would indicate that all pages with smaller lsn should be discarded. Delete marker will travel down the tree levels hierarchy until it reaches last level. In non-PITR scenario where old page version are not needed at all such deletion marker would (in average) prevent old page versions propagation down the tree -- so all bloat would concentrate at higher tree layers without affecting bigger bottom layers.

### **Recovery**

Upon storage node restart recent WAL files are applied to appropriate pages and resulting pages stored in lsm memtable. So this should be fast since we are not writing anything to disk.

### **Checkpointing**

No such mechanism is needed. Or we may look at the storage node as at kind of continuous checkpointer.

### **Full page writes (torn page protection)**

Storage node never updates individual pages, only merges SSTable, so torn pages is not an issue.

### **Snapshot**

That is the part that I like about this design -- snapshot creation is instant and cheap operation that can have flexible granularity level: whole instance, database, table. Snapshot creation inserts a record in `chunk.meta` file with lsn of this snapshot and key prefix `(pg_id, db_id, db_timeline, rel_id, *)` that prohibits pages deletion within this range. Storage node may not know anything about page internals, but by changing number of fields in our prefix we may change snapshot granularity.

It is again useful to remap `rel_id` to `(indexed_relation_id, rel_id)` so that snapshot of relation would include it's indices. Also table snapshot would trickily interact with catalog. Probably all table snapshots should hold also a catalog snapshot. And when node is started with such snapshot it should check that only tables from snapshot are queried. I assume here that for snapshot reading one need to start a new postgres instance.

Storage consumed by snapshot is proportional to the amount of data changed. We may have some heuristic (calculated based on cost of different storages) about when to offload old snapshot to s3. For example, if current database has more then 40% of changed pages with respect to previous snapshot then we may offload that snapshot to s3, and release this space.

**Starting db from snapshot**

When we are starting database from snapshot it can be done in two ways. First, we may create new db_id, move all the data from snapshot to a new db and start a database. Second option is to create Copy-on-Write (CoW) instance out of snapshot and read old pages from old snapshot and store new pages separately. That is why there is `db_timeline` key field near `db_id` -- CoW (🐮) database should create new `db_timeline` and remember old `db_timeline`. Such a database can have hashmap of pages that it is changed to query pages from proper snapshot on the first try. `db_timeline` is located near `db_id` so that new page versions generated by new instance would not bloat data of initial snapshot. It is not clear for whether it is possibly to effectively support "stacked" CoW snapshot, so we may disallow them. (Well, one way to support them is to move `db_timeline` close to `lsn` -- so we may scan neighboring pages and find right one. But again that way we bloat snapshot with unrelated data and may slowdown full scans that are happening in different database).

**Snapshot export/import**

Once we may start CoW instances it is easy to run auxiliary postgres instance on this snapshot and run `COPY FROM (...) TO stdout` or `pg_dump` and export data from the snapshot to some portable formats. Also we may start postgres on a new empty database and run `COPY FROM stdin`. This way we can initialize new non-CoW databases and transfer snapshots via network.

### **PITR area**

In described scheme PITR is just a prohibition to delete any versions within some key prefix, either it is a database or a table key prefix. So PITR may have different settings for different tables, databases, etc.

PITR is quite bloaty, so we may aggressively offload it to s3 -- we may push same (or bigger) SSTables to s3 and maintain lsm structure there.

### **Compression**

Since we are storing page diffs of variable sizes there is no structural dependency on a page size and we may compress it. Again that could be enabled only on pages with some key prefixes, so we may have this with db/table granularity.

### **Chunk metadata**

Chunk metadata is a file lies in chunk directory that stores info about current snapshots and PITR regions. Chunk should always consult this data when merging SSTables and applying delete markers.

### **Chunk splitting**

*(NB: following paragraph is about how to avoid page splitting)*

When chunks hits some soft storage limit (let's say 100Gb) it should be split in half and global metadata about chunk boundaries should be updated. Here i assume that chunk split is a local operation happening on single node. Process of chink splitting should look like following:

1. Find separation key and spawn two new chunks with [lo, mid) [mid, hi) boundaries.

2. Prohibit WAL deletion and old SSTables deletion on original chunk.

3. On each lsm layer we would need to split only one SSTable, all other would fit within left or right range. Symlink/split that files to new chunks.

4. Start WAL replay on new chunks.

5. Update global metadata about new chunk boundaries.

6. Eventually (metadata update should be pushed to processing node by metadata service) storage node will start sending WAL and page requests to the new nodes.

7. New chunk may start serving read queries when following conditions are met:

a) it receives at least on WAL record from processing node

b) it replayed all WAL up to the new received one

c) checked by downlinks that there were no WAL gaps.

Chunk split as it is described here is quite fast operation when it is happening on the local disk -- vast majority of files will be just moved without copying anything. I suggest to keep split always local and not to mix it with chunk moving around cluster. So if we want to split some chunk but there is small amount of free space left on the device, we should first move some chunks away from the node and then proceed with splitting.

### Fixed chunks

Alternative strategy is to not to split at all and have pageno-fixed chunk boundaries. When table is created we first materialize this chunk by storing first new pages only and chunks is small. Then chunk is growing while table is filled, but it can't grow substantially bigger then allowed pageno range, so at max it would be 1GB or whatever limit we want + some bloat due to snapshots and old page versions.

### **Chunk lsm internals**

So how to implement chunk's lsm?

- Write from scratch and use RocksDB to prototype/benchmark, then switch to own lsm implementation. RocksDB can provide some sanity check for performance of home-brewed implementation and it would be easier to prototype.
- Use postgres as lego constructor. We may model memtable with postgres B-tree referencing some in-memory log of incoming records. SSTable merging may reuse postgres external merging algorithm, etc. One thing that would definitely not fit (or I didn't came up with idea how to fit that) -- is multi-tenancy. If we are storing pages from different databases we can't use postgres buffer pool, since there is no db_id in the page header. We can add new field there but IMO it would be no go for committing that to vanilla.

Other possibility is to not to try to fit few databases in one storage node. But that way it is no go for multi-tenant cloud installation: we would need to run a lot of storage node instances on one physical storage node, all with it own local page cache. So that would be much closer to ordinary managed RDS.

Multi-tenant storage makes sense even on a laptop, when you work with different databases, running tests with temp database, etc. And when installation grows bigger it start to make more and more sense, so it seems important.

# Storage fleet

# **Storage fleet**

- When database is smaller then a chunk size we naturally can store them in one chunk (since their page_key would fit in some chunk's [hi, lo) range).

<img width="937" alt="Screenshot_2021-02-22_at_16 49 17" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/284219/108729836-ffcbd200-753b-11eb-9412-db802ec30021.png">

Few databases are stored in one chunk, replicated three times

- When database can't fit into one storage node it can occupy lots of chunks that were split while database was growing. Chunk placement on nodes is controlled by us with some automatization, but we always may manually move chunks around the cluster.

<img width="940" alt="Screenshot_2021-02-22_at_16 49 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/284219/108729815-fb071e00-753b-11eb-86e0-be6703e47d82.png">

Here one big database occupies two set of nodes. Also some chunks were moved around to restore replication factor after disk failure. In this case we also have "sharded" storage for a big database and issue wal writes to different chunks in parallel.

## **Chunk placement strategies**

There are few scenarios where we may want to move chunks around the cluster:

- disk usage on some node is big
- some disk experienced a failure
- some node experienced a failure or need maintenance

## **Chunk replication**

Chunk replication may be done by cloning page ranges with respect to some lsn from peer nodes, updating global metadata, waiting for WAL to come, replaying previous WAL and becoming online -- more or less like during chunk split.



# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/003-laptop-cli.md:

# Command line interface (end-user)

Neon CLI as it is described here mostly resides on the same conceptual level as pg_ctl/initdb/pg_recvxlog/etc and replaces some of them in an opinionated way. I would also suggest bundling our patched postgres inside neon distribution at least at the start.

This proposal is focused on managing local installations. For cluster operations, different tooling would be needed. The point of integration between the two is storage URL: no matter how complex cluster setup is it may provide an endpoint where the user may push snapshots.

The most important concept here is a snapshot, which can be created/pushed/pulled/exported. Also, we may start temporary read-only postgres instance over any local snapshot. A more complex scenario would consist of several basic operations over snapshots.

# Possible usage scenarios

## Install neon, run a postgres

```
> brew install pg-neon 
> neon pg create # creates pgdata with default pattern pgdata$i
> neon pg list
ID            PGDATA        USED    STORAGE            ENDPOINT
primary1      pgdata1       0G      neon-local       localhost:5432
```

## Import standalone postgres to neon

```
> neon snapshot import --from=basebackup://replication@localhost:5432/ oldpg
[====================------------] 60% | 20MB/s
> neon snapshot list
ID          SIZE        PARENT
oldpg       5G          -

> neon pg create --snapshot oldpg
Started postgres on localhost:5432

> neon pg list
ID            PGDATA        USED    STORAGE            ENDPOINT
primary1      pgdata1       5G      neon-local       localhost:5432

> neon snapshot destroy oldpg
Ok
```

Also, we may start snapshot import implicitly by looking at snapshot schema

```
> neon pg create --snapshot basebackup://replication@localhost:5432/
Downloading snapshot... Done.
Started postgres on localhost:5432
Destroying snapshot... Done.
```

## Pull snapshot with some publicly shared database

Since we may export the whole snapshot as one big file (tar of basebackup, maybe with some manifest) it may be shared over conventional means: http, ssh, [git+lfs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage).

```
> neon pg create --snapshot http://learn-postgres.com/movies_db.neon movies
```

## Create snapshot and push it to the cloud

```
> neon snapshot create pgdata1@snap1
> neon snapshot push --to ssh://stas@neon.tech pgdata1@snap1
```

## Rollback database to the snapshot

One way to rollback the database is just to init a new database from the snapshot and destroy the old one. But creating a new database from a snapshot would require a copy of that snapshot which is time consuming operation. Another option that would be cool to support is the ability to create the copy-on-write database from the snapshot without copying data, and store updated pages in a separate location, however that way would have performance implications. So to properly rollback the database to the older state we have `neon pg checkout`.

```
> neon pg list
ID            PGDATA        USED    STORAGE            ENDPOINT
primary1      pgdata1       5G      neon-local       localhost:5432

> neon snapshot create pgdata1@snap1

> neon snapshot list
ID                    SIZE        PARENT
oldpg                 5G          -
pgdata1@snap1         6G          -
pgdata1@CURRENT       6G          -

> neon pg checkout pgdata1@snap1
Stopping postgres on pgdata1.
Rolling back pgdata1@CURRENT to pgdata1@snap1.
Starting postgres on pgdata1.

> neon snapshot list
ID                    SIZE        PARENT
oldpg                 5G          -
pgdata1@snap1         6G          -
pgdata1@HEAD{0}       6G          -
pgdata1@CURRENT       6G          -
```

Some notes: pgdata1@CURRENT -- implicit snapshot representing the current state of the database in the data directory. When we are checking out some snapshot CURRENT will be set to this snapshot and the old CURRENT state will be named HEAD{0} (0 is the number of postgres timeline, it would be incremented after each such checkout).

## Configure PITR area (Point In Time Recovery).

PITR area acts like a continuous snapshot where you can reset the database to any point in time within this area (by area I mean some TTL period or some size limit, both possibly infinite).

```
> neon pitr create --storage s3tank --ttl 30d --name pitr_last_month
```

Resetting the database to some state in past would require creating a snapshot on some lsn / time in this pirt area.

# Manual

## storage

Storage is either neon pagestore or s3. Users may create a database in a pagestore and create/move *snapshots* and *pitr regions* in both pagestore and s3. Storage is a concept similar to `git remote`. After installation, I imagine one local storage is available by default.

**neon storage attach** -t [native|s3] -c key=value -n name

Attaches/initializes storage. For --type=s3, user credentials and path should be provided. For --type=native we may support --path=/local/path and --url=neon.tech/stas/mystore. Other possible term for native is 'zstore'.


**neon storage list**

Show currently attached storages. For example:

```
> neon storage list
NAME            USED    TYPE                OPTIONS          PATH
local           5.1G    neon-local                         /opt/neon/store/local
local.compr     20.4G   neon-local        compression=on    /opt/neon/store/local.compr
zcloud          60G     neon-remote                        neon.tech/stas/mystore
s3tank          80G     S3
```

**neon storage detach**

**neon storage show**



## pg

Manages postgres data directories and can start postgres instances with proper configuration. An experienced user may avoid using that (except pg create) and configure/run postgres by themselves.

Pg is a term for a single postgres running on some data. I'm trying to avoid separation of datadir management and postgres instance management -- both that concepts bundled here together.

**neon pg create** [--no-start --snapshot --cow] -s storage-name -n pgdata

Creates (initializes) new data directory in given storage and starts postgres. I imagine that storage for this operation may be only local and data movement to remote location happens through snapshots/pitr.

--no-start: just init datadir without creating 

--snapshot snap: init from the snapshot. Snap is a name or URL (neon.tech/stas/mystore/snap1)

--cow: initialize Copy-on-Write data directory on top of some snapshot (makes sense if it is a snapshot of currently running a database)

**neon pg destroy**

**neon pg start** [--replica] pgdata

Start postgres with proper extensions preloaded/installed.

**neon pg checkout**

Rollback data directory to some previous snapshot. 

**neon pg stop** pg_id

**neon pg list**

```
ROLE                 PGDATA        USED    STORAGE            ENDPOINT
primary              my_pg         5.1G    local              localhost:5432
replica-1                                                     localhost:5433
replica-2                                                     localhost:5434
primary              my_pg2        3.2G    local.compr        localhost:5435
-                    my_pg3        9.2G    local.compr        -
```

**neon pg show**

```
my_pg:
    storage: local
    space used on local: 5.1G
    space used on all storages: 15.1G
    snapshots:
        on local:
            snap1: 1G
            snap2: 1G
        on zcloud:
            snap2: 1G
        on s3tank:
            snap5: 2G
    pitr:
        on s3tank:
            pitr_one_month: 45G

```

**neon pg start-rest/graphql** pgdata

Starts REST/GraphQL proxy on top of postgres master. Not sure we should do that, just an idea.


## snapshot

Snapshot creation is cheap -- no actual data is copied, we just start retaining old pages. Snapshot size means the amount of retained data, not all data. Snapshot name looks like pgdata_name@tag_name. tag_name is set by the user during snapshot creation. There are some reserved tag names: CURRENT represents the current state of the data directory; HEAD{i} represents the data directory state that resided in the database before i-th checkout.

**neon snapshot create** pgdata_name@snap_name

Creates a new snapshot in the same storage where pgdata_name exists.

**neon snapshot push** --to url pgdata_name@snap_name

Produces binary stream of a given snapshot. Under the hood starts temp read-only postgres over this snapshot and sends basebackup stream. Receiving side should start `neon snapshot recv` before push happens. If url has some special schema like neon:// receiving side may require auth start `neon snapshot recv` on the go.

**neon snapshot recv**

Starts a port listening for a basebackup stream, prints connection info to stdout (so that user may use that in push command), and expects data on that socket.

**neon snapshot pull** --from url or path

Connects to a remote neon/s3/file and pulls snapshot. The remote site should be neon service or files in our format.

**neon snapshot import** --from basebackup://<...>  or path

Creates a new snapshot out of running postgres via basebackup protocol or basebackup files.

**neon snapshot export**

Starts read-only postgres over this snapshot and exports data in some format (pg_dump, or COPY TO on some/all tables). One of the options may be neon own format which is handy for us (but I think just tar of basebackup would be okay).

**neon snapshot diff** snap1 snap2

Shows size of data changed between two snapshots. We also may provide options to diff schema/data in tables. To do that start temp read-only postgreses.

**neon snapshot destroy**

## pitr

Pitr represents wal stream and ttl policy for that stream

XXX: any suggestions on a better name?

**neon pitr create** name

--ttl = inf | period

--size-limit = inf | limit

--storage = storage_name

**neon pitr extract-snapshot** pitr_name --lsn xxx

Creates a snapshot out of some lsn in PITR area. The obtained snapshot may be managed with snapshot routines (move/send/export)

**neon pitr gc** pitr_name

Force garbage collection on some PITR area.

**neon pitr list**

**neon pitr destroy**


## console

**neon console**

Opens browser targeted at web console with the more or less same functionality as described here.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/004-durability.md:

Durability & Consensus
======================

When a transaction commits, a commit record is generated in the WAL.
When do we consider the WAL record as durable, so that we can
acknowledge the commit to the client and be reasonably certain that we
will not lose the transaction?

Neon uses a group of WAL safekeeper nodes to hold the generated WAL.
A WAL record is considered durable, when it has been written to a
majority of WAL safekeeper nodes. In this document, I use 5
safekeepers, because I have five fingers. A WAL record is durable,
when at least 3 safekeepers have written it to disk.

First, assume that only one primary node can be running at a
time. This can be achieved by Kubernetes or etcd or some
cloud-provider specific facility, or we can implement it
ourselves. These options are discussed in later chapters.  For now,
assume that there is a Magic STONITH Fairy that ensures that.

In addition to the WAL safekeeper nodes, the WAL is archived in
S3. WAL that has been archived to S3 can be removed from the
safekeepers, so the safekeepers don't need a lot of disk space.

```
                                +----------------+

                                +--------+

```
Every WAL safekeeper holds a section of WAL, and a VCL value.
The WAL can be divided into three portions:

```
                                    VCL                   LSN
                                     |                     |
                                     V                     V
.................ccccccccccccccccccccXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Archived WAL       Completed WAL          In-flight WAL
```

Note that all this WAL kept in a safekeeper is a contiguous section.
This is different from Aurora: In Aurora, there can be holes in the
WAL, and there is a Gossip protocol to fill the holes. That could be
implemented in the future, but let's keep it simple for now. WAL needs
to be written to a safekeeper in order. However, during crash
recovery, In-flight WAL that has already been stored in a safekeeper
can be truncated or overwritten.

The Archived WAL has already been stored in S3, and can be removed from
the safekeeper.

The Completed WAL has been written to at least three safekeepers. The
algorithm ensures that it is not lost, when at most two nodes fail at
the same time.

The In-flight WAL has been persisted in the safekeeper, but if a crash
happens, it may still be overwritten or truncated.


The VCL point is determined in the Primary. It is not strictly
necessary to store it in the safekeepers, but it allows some
optimizations and sanity checks and is probably generally useful for
the system as whole. The VCL values stored in the safekeepers can lag
behind the VCL computed by the primary.


Primary node Normal operation
-----------------------------

1. Generate some WAL.

2. Send the WAL to all the safekeepers that you can reach.

3. As soon as a quorum of safekeepers have acknowledged that they have
   received and durably stored the WAL up to that LSN, update local VCL
   value in memory, and acknowledge commits to the clients.

4. Send the new VCL to all the safekeepers that were part of the quorum.
   (Optional)


Primary Crash recovery
----------------------

When a new Primary node starts up, before it can generate any new WAL
it needs to contact a majority of the WAL safekeepers to compute the
VCL. Remember that there is a Magic STONITH fairy that ensures that
only node process can be doing this at a time.

1. Contact all WAL safekeepers. Find the Max((Epoch, LSN)) tuple among the ones you
   can reach. This is the Winner safekeeper, and its LSN becomes the new VCL.

2. Update the other safekeepers you can reach, by copying all the WAL
   from the Winner, starting from each safekeeper's old VCL point. Any old
   In-Flight WAL from previous Epoch is truncated away.

3. Increment Epoch, and send the new Epoch to the quorum of
   safekeepers.  (This ensures that if any of the safekeepers that we
   could not reach later come back online, they will be considered as
   older than this in any future recovery)

You can now start generating new WAL, starting from the newly-computed
VCL.

Optimizations
-------------

As described, the Primary node sends all the WAL to all the WAL safekeepers. That
can be a lot of network traffic. Instead of sending the WAL directly from Primary,
some safekeepers can be daisy-chained off other safekeepers, or there can be a
broadcast mechanism among them. There should still be a direct connection from the
each safekeeper to the Primary for the acknowledgments though.

Similarly, the responsibility for archiving WAL to S3 can be delegated to one of
the safekeepers, to reduce the load on the primary.


Magic STONITH fairy
-------------------

Now that we have a system that works as long as only one primary node is running at a time, how
do we ensure that?

1. Use etcd to grant a lease on a key. The primary node is only allowed to operate as primary
   when it's holding a valid lease. If the primary node dies, the lease expires after a timeout
   period, and a new node is allowed to become the primary.

2. Use S3 to store the lease. S3's consistency guarantees are more lenient, so in theory you
   cannot do this safely. In practice, it would probably be OK if you make the lease times and
   timeouts long enough. This has the advantage that we don't need to introduce a new
   component to the architecture.

3. Use Raft or Paxos, with the WAL safekeepers acting as the Acceptors to form the quorum. The
   next chapter describes this option.


Built-in Paxos
--------------

The WAL safekeepers act as PAXOS Acceptors, and the Processing nodes
as both Proposers and Learners.

Each WAL safekeeper holds an Epoch value in addition to the VCL and
the WAL. Each request by the primary to safekeep WAL is accompanied by
an Epoch value. If a safekeeper receives a request with Epoch that
doesn't match its current Accepted Epoch, it must ignore (NACK) it.
(In different Paxos papers, Epochs are called "terms" or "round
numbers")

When a node wants to become the primary, it generates a new Epoch
value that is higher than any previously observed Epoch value, and
globally unique.


Accepted Epoch: 555                VCL                   LSN
                                     |                     |
                                     V                     V
.................ccccccccccccccccccccXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Archived WAL       Completed WAL          In-flight WAL


Primary node startup:

1. Contact all WAL safekeepers that you can reach (if you cannot
   connect to a quorum of them, you can give up immediately). Find the
   latest Epoch among them.

2. Generate a new globally unique Epoch, greater than the latest Epoch
   found in previous step.

2. Send the new Epoch in a Prepare message to a quorum of
   safekeepers. (PAXOS Prepare message)

3. Each safekeeper responds with a Promise. If a safekeeper has
   already made a promise with a higher Epoch, it doesn't respond (or
   responds with a NACK). After making a promise, the safekeeper stops
   responding to any write requests with earlier Epoch.

4. Once you have received a majority of promises, you know that the
   VCL cannot advance on the old Epoch anymore. This effectively kills
   any old primary server.

5. Find the highest written LSN among the quorum of safekeepers (these
   can be included in the Promise messages already). This is the new
   VCL.  If a new node starts the election process after this point,
   it will compute the same or higher VCL.

6. Copy the WAL from the safekeeper with the highest LSN to the other
   safekeepers in the quorum, using the new Epoch. (PAXOS Accept
   phase)

7. You can now start generating new WAL starting from the VCL. If
   another process starts the election process after this point and
   gains control of a majority of the safekeepers, we will no longer
   be able to advance the VCL.



# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/005-zenith_local.md:

# Neon local

Here I list some objectives to keep in mind when discussing neon-local design and a proposal that brings all components together.  Your comments on both parts are very welcome.

#### Why do we need it?
- For distribution - this easy to use binary will help us to build adoption among developers.
- For internal use - to test all components together.

In my understanding, we consider it to be just a mock-up version of neon-cloud.
> Question: How much should we care about durability and security issues for a local setup?


#### Why is it better than a simple local postgres?

- Easy one-line setup. As simple as `cargo install neon && neon start`

- Quick and cheap creation of compute nodes over the same storage.
> Question: How can we describe a use-case for this feature?

- Neon-local can work with S3 directly. 

- Push and pull images (snapshots) to remote S3 to exchange data with other users.

- Quick and cheap snapshot checkouts to switch back and forth in the database history.
> Question: Do we want it in the very first release? This feature seems quite complicated.

#### Distribution:

Ideally, just one binary that incorporates all elements we need.
> Question: Let's discuss pros and cons of having a separate package with modified PostgreSQL.

#### Components:

- **neon-CLI** - interface for end-users.  Turns commands to REST requests and handles responses to show them in a user-friendly way.  
CLI proposal is here https://github.com/neondatabase/rfcs/blob/003-laptop-cli.md/003-laptop-cli.md
WIP code is here: https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/main/pageserver/src/bin/cli

- **neon-console** - WEB UI with same functionality as CLI.
>Note: not for the first release.

- **neon-local** - entrypoint. Service that starts all other components and handles REST API requests. See REST API proposal below.
    > Idea: spawn all other components as child processes, so that we could shutdown everything by stopping neon-local.

- **neon-pageserver** - consists of a storage and WAL-replaying service (modified PG in current implementation).
> Question: Probably, for local setup we should be able to bypass page-storage and interact directly with S3 to avoid double caching in shared buffers and page-server?

WIP code is here: https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/main/pageserver/src

- **neon-S3** - stores base images of the database and WAL in S3 object storage. Import and export images from/to neon.
> Question: How should it operate in a local setup? Will we manage it ourselves or ask user to provide credentials for existing S3 object storage (i.e. minio)?
> Question: Do we use it together with local page store or they are interchangeable?

WIP code is ???

- **neon-safekeeper** - receives WAL from postgres, stores it durably, answers to Postgres that "sync" is succeed.
> Question: How should it operate in a local setup? In my understanding it should push WAL directly to S3 (if we use it) or store all data locally (if we use local page storage). The latter option seems meaningless (extra overhead and no gain), but it is still good to test the system.

WIP code is here: https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/tree/main/src/bin/safekeeper

- **neon-computenode** - bottomless PostgreSQL, ideally upstream, but for a start - our modified version. User can quickly create and destroy them and work with it as a regular postgres database.
 
 WIP code is in main branch and here: https://github.com/neondatabase/postgres/commits/compute_node

#### REST API:

Service endpoint: `http://localhost:3000`

Resources:
- /storages - Where data lives: neon-pageserver or neon-s3

# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/006-laptop-cli-v2-CLI.md:

Neon CLI allows you to operate database clusters (catalog clusters) and their commit history locally and in the cloud. Since ANSI calls them catalog clusters and cluster is a loaded term in the modern infrastructure we will call it "catalog".

# CLI v2 (after chatting with Carl)

Neon introduces the notion of a repository.

```bash
neon init
neon clone neon://neon.tech/piedpiper/northwind -- clones a repo to the northwind directory
```

Once you have a cluster catalog you can explore it

```bash
neon log -- returns a list of commits
neon status -- returns if there are changes in the catalog that can be committed
neon commit -- commits the changes and generates a new commit hash
neon branch experimental <hash> -- creates a branch called testdb based on a given commit hash
```

To make changes in the catalog you need to run compute nodes

```bash
-- here is how you a compute node
neon start /home/pipedpiper/northwind:main -- starts a compute instance
neon start neon://neon.tech/northwind:main -- starts a compute instance in the cloud
-- you can start a compute node against any hash or branch
neon start /home/pipedpiper/northwind:experimental --port 8008 -- start another compute instance (on different port)
-- you can start a compute node against any hash or branch
neon start /home/pipedpiper/northwind:<hash> --port 8009 -- start another compute instance (on different port)

-- After running some DML you can run 
-- neon status and see how there are two WAL streams one on top of 
-- the main branch
neon status 
-- and another on top of the experimental branch
neon status -b experimental

-- you can commit each branch separately
neon commit main
-- or
neon commit -c /home/pipedpiper/northwind:experimental
```

Starting compute instances against cloud environments

```bash
-- you can start a compute instance against the cloud environment
-- in this case all of the changes will be streamed into the cloud
neon start https://neon:tecj/pipedpiper/northwind:main
neon start https://neon:tecj/pipedpiper/northwind:main
neon status -c https://neon:tecj/pipedpiper/northwind:main
neon commit -c https://neon:tecj/pipedpiper/northwind:main
neon branch -c https://neon:tecj/pipedpiper/northwind:<hash> experimental
```

Pushing data into the cloud

```bash
-- pull all the commits from the cloud
neon pull
-- push all the commits to the cloud
neon push
```

# Repository format

A Neon repository is similar to a traditional PostgreSQL backup
archive, like a WAL-G bucket or pgbarman backup catalogue. It holds
multiple versions of a PostgreSQL database cluster.

The distinguishing feature is that you can launch a Neon Postgres
server directly against a branch in the repository, without having to
"restore" it first. Also, Neon manages the storage automatically,
there is no separation between full and incremental backups nor WAL
archive. Neon relies heavily on the WAL, and uses concepts similar
to incremental backups and WAL archiving internally, but it is hidden
from the user.

## Directory structure, version 1

This first version is pretty straightforward but not very
efficient. Just something to get us started.

The repository directory looks like this:

    .neon/timelines/4543be3daeab2ed4e58a285cbb8dd1fce6970f8c/wal/
    .neon/timelines/4543be3daeab2ed4e58a285cbb8dd1fce6970f8c/snapshots/<lsn>/
    .neon/timelines/4543be3daeab2ed4e58a285cbb8dd1fce6970f8c/history
    
    .neon/refs/branches/mybranch
    .neon/refs/tags/foo
    .neon/refs/tags/bar
    
    .neon/datadirs/<timeline uuid>

### Timelines

A timeline is similar to PostgeSQL's timeline, but is identified by a
UUID instead of a 32-bit timeline Id.  For user convenience, it can be
given a name that refers to the UUID (called a branch).

All WAL is generated on a timeline. You can launch a read-only node
against a tag or arbitrary LSN on a timeline, but in order to write,
you need to create a timeline.

Each timeline is stored in a directory under .neon/timelines. It
consists of a WAL archive, containing all the WAL in the standard
PostgreSQL format, under the wal/ subdirectory.

The 'snapshots/' subdirectory, contains "base backups" of the data
directory at a different LSNs. Each snapshot is simply a copy of the
Postgres data directory.

When a new timeline is forked from a previous timeline, the ancestor
timeline's UUID is stored in the 'history' file.

### Refs

There are two kinds of named objects in the repository: branches and
tags.  A branch is a human-friendly name for a timeline UUID, and a
tag is a human-friendly name for a specific LSN on a timeline
(timeline UUID + LSN).  Like in git, these are just for user
convenience; you can also use timeline UUIDs and LSNs directly.

Refs do have one additional purpose though: naming a timeline or LSN
prevents it from being automatically garbage collected.

The refs directory contains a small text file for each tag/branch. It
contains the UUID of the timeline (and LSN, for tags).

### Datadirs

.neon/datadirs contains PostgreSQL data directories. You can launch
a Postgres instance on one of them with:

```
  postgres -D .neon/datadirs/4543be3daeab2ed4e58a285cbb8dd1fce6970f8c
```

All the actual data is kept in the timeline directories, under
.neon/timelines. The data directories are only needed for active
PostgreQSL instances. After an instance is stopped, the data directory
can be safely removed. "neon start" will recreate it quickly from
the data in .neon/timelines, if it's missing.

## Version 2

The format described above isn't very different from a traditional
daily base backup + WAL archive configuration. The main difference is
the nicer naming of branches and tags.

That's not very efficient. For performance, we need something like
incremental backups that don't require making a full copy of all
data. So only store modified files or pages. And instead of having to
replay all WAL from the last snapshot, "slice" the WAL into
per-relation WAL files and only recover what's needed when a table is
accessed.

In version 2, the file format in the "snapshots" subdirectory gets
more advanced. The exact format is TODO. But it should support:
- storing WAL records of individual relations/pages
- storing a delta from an older snapshot
- compression


## Operations

### Garbage collection

When you run "neon gc", old timelines that are no longer needed are
removed. That involves collecting the list of "unreachable" objects,
starting from the named branches and tags.

Also, if enough WAL has been generated on a timeline since last
snapshot, a new snapshot or delta is created.

### neon push/pull

Compare the tags and branches on both servers, and copy missing ones.
For each branch, compare the timeline it points to in both servers. If
one is behind the other, copy the missing parts.

FIXME: how do you prevent confusion if you have to clones of the same
repository, launch an instance on the same branch in both clones, and
later try to push/pull between them? Perhaps create a new timeline
every time you start up an instance? Then you would detect that the
timelines have diverged. That would match with the "epoch" concept
that we have in the WAL safekeeper

### neon checkout/commit

In this format, there is no concept of a "working tree", and hence no
concept of checking out or committing. All modifications are done on
a branch or a timeline. As soon as you launch a server, the changes are
appended to the timeline.

You can easily fork off a temporary timeline to emulate a "working tree".
You can later remove it and have it garbage collected, or to "commit",
re-point the branch to the new timeline.

If we want to have a worktree and "neon checkout/commit" concept, we can
emulate that with a temporary timeline. Create the temporary timeline at
"neon checkout", and have "neon commit" modify the branch to point to
the new timeline.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/007-serverless-on-laptop.md:

How it works now
----------------

1. Create repository, start page server on it

```
$ neon init
...
created main branch
new neon repository was created in .neon

$ neon pageserver start
Starting pageserver at '127.0.0.1:64000' in .neon
Page server started
```

2. Create a branch, and start a Postgres instance on it

```
$ neon branch heikki main
branching at end of WAL: 0/15ECF68

$ neon pg create heikki
Initializing Postgres on timeline 76cf9279915be7797095241638e64644...
Extracting base backup to create postgres instance: path=.neon/pgdatadirs/pg1 port=55432

$ neon pg start pg1
Starting postgres node at 'host=127.0.0.1 port=55432 user=heikki'
waiting for server to start.... done
server started
```


3. Connect to it and run queries

```
$ psql "dbname=postgres port=55432"
psql (14devel)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```


Proposal: Serverless on your Laptop
-----------------------------------

We've been talking about doing the "pg create" step automatically at
"pg start", to eliminate that step. What if we go further, go
serverless on your laptop, so that the workflow becomes just:

1. Create repository, start page server on it (same as before)

```
$ neon init
...
created main branch
new neon repository was created in .neon

$ neon pageserver start
Starting pageserver at '127.0.0.1:64000' in .neon
Page server started
```

2. Create branch

```
$ neon branch heikki main
branching at end of WAL: 0/15ECF68
```

3. Connect to it:

```
$ psql "dbname=postgres port=5432 branch=heikki"
psql (14devel)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```


The trick behind the scenes is that when you launch the page server,
it starts to listen on port 5432. When you connect to it with psql, it
looks at the 'branch' parameter that you passed in the connection
string. It automatically performs the "pg create" and "pg start" steps
for that branch, and then forwards the connection to the Postgres
instance that it launched. After you disconnect, if there are no more
active connections to the server running on the branch, it can
automatically shut it down again.

This is how serverless would work in the cloud. We can do it on your
laptop, too.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/008-push-pull.md:

# Push and pull between pageservers

Here is a proposal about implementing push/pull mechanics between pageservers. We also want to be able to push/pull to S3 but that would depend on the exact storage format so we don't touch that in this proposal.

## Origin management

The origin represents connection info for some remote pageserver. Let's use here same commands as git uses except using explicit list subcommand (git uses `origin -v` for that).

```
neon origin add <name> <connection_uri>
neon origin list
neon origin remove <name>
```

Connection URI a string of form `postgresql://user:pass@hostname:port` (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6). We can start with libpq password auth and later add support for client certs or require ssh as transport or invent some other kind of transport.

Behind the scenes, this commands may update toml file inside .neon directory.

## Push

### Pushing branch

```
neon push mybranch cloudserver # push to eponymous branch in cloudserver
neon push mybranch cloudserver:otherbranch # push to a different branch in cloudserver
```

Exact mechanics would be slightly different in the following situations:

1) Destination branch does not exist.

    That is the simplest scenario. We can just create an empty branch (or timeline in internal terminology) and transfer all the pages/records that we have in our timeline. Right now each timeline is quite independent of other timelines so I suggest skipping any checks that there is a common ancestor and just fill it with data. Later when CoW timelines will land to the pageserver we may add that check and decide whether this timeline belongs to this pageserver repository or not [*].

    The exact mechanics may be the following:

    * CLI asks local pageserver to perform push and hands over connection uri: `perform_push <branch_name> <uri>`.
    * local pageserver connects to the remote pageserver and runs `branch_push <branch_name> <timetine_id>`
        Handler for branch_create would create destination timeline and switch connection to copyboth mode.
    * Sending pageserver may start iterator on that timeline and send all the records as copy messages.

2) Destination branch exists and latest_valid_lsn is less than ours.

    In this case, we need to send missing records. To do that we need to find all pages that were changed since that remote LSN. Right now we don't have any tracking mechanism for that, so let's just iterate over all records and send ones that are newer than remote LSN. Later we probably should add a sparse bitmap that would track changed pages to avoid full scan.

3) Destination branch exists and latest_valid_lsn is bigger than ours.

    In this case, we can't push to that branch. We can only pull.

### Pulling branch

Here we need to handle the same three cases, but also keep in mind that local pageserver can be behind NAT and we can't trivially re-use pushing by asking remote to 'perform_push' to our address. So we would need a new set of commands:

* CLI calls `perform_pull <branch_name> <uri>` on local pageserver.
* local pageserver calls `branch_pull <branch_name> <timetine_id>` on remote pageserver.
* remote pageserver sends records in our direction

But despite the different set of commands code that performs iteration over records and receiving code that inserts that records can be the same for both pull and push.



[*] It looks to me that there are two different possible approaches to handling unrelated timelines:

1) Allow storing unrelated timelines in one repo. Some timelines may have parents and some may not.
2) Transparently create and manage several repositories in one pageserver.

But that is the topic for a separate RFC/discussion.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/009-snapshot-first-storage-cli.md:

While working on export/import commands, I understood that they fit really well into "snapshot-first design".

We may think about backups as snapshots in a different format (i.e plain pgdata format, basebackup tar format, WAL-G format (if they want to support it) and so on). They use same storage API, the only difference is the code that packs/unpacks files.

Even if neon aims to maintains durability using it's own snapshots, backups will be useful for uploading data from postgres to neon.

So here is an attempt to design consistent CLI for different usage scenarios:

#### 1. Start empty pageserver.
That is what we have now.
Init empty pageserver using `initdb` in temporary directory.

`--storage_dest=FILE_PREFIX | S3_PREFIX |...` option defines object storage type, all other parameters are passed via env variables. Inspired by WAL-G style naming : https://wal-g.readthedocs.io/STORAGES/.

Save`storage_dest` and other parameters in config.
Push snapshots to `storage_dest` in background.

```
neon init --storage_dest=S3_PREFIX
neon start
```

#### 2. Restart pageserver (manually or crash-recovery).
Take `storage_dest` from pageserver config, start pageserver from latest snapshot in `storage_dest`.
Push snapshots to `storage_dest` in background.

```
neon start
```

#### 3. Import.
Start pageserver from existing snapshot.
Path to snapshot provided via `--snapshot_path=FILE_PREFIX | S3_PREFIX | ...`
Do not save `snapshot_path` and `snapshot_format` in config, as it is a one-time operation.
Save`storage_dest` parameters in config.
Push snapshots to `storage_dest` in background.
```
//I.e. we want to start neon on top of existing $PGDATA and use s3 as a persistent storage.
neon init --snapshot_path=FILE_PREFIX --snapshot_format=pgdata --storage_dest=S3_PREFIX
neon start
```
How to pass credentials needed for `snapshot_path`?

#### 4. Export.
Manually push snapshot to `snapshot_path` which differs from `storage_dest`
Optionally set `snapshot_format`, which can be plain pgdata format or neon format.
```
neon export --snapshot_path=FILE_PREFIX --snapshot_format=pgdata
```

#### Notes and questions
- safekeeper s3_offload should use same (similar) syntax for storage. How to set it in UI?
- Why do we need `neon init` as a separate command? Can't we init everything at first start?
- We can think of better names for all options.
- Export to plain postgres format will be useless, if we are not 100% compatible on page level.
I can recall at least one such difference - PD_WAL_LOGGED flag in pages.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/009-snapshot-first-storage-pitr.md:

# Preface

GetPage@LSN can be called with older LSNs, and the page server needs
to be able to reconstruct older page versions. That's needed for
having read-only replicas that lag behind the primary, or that are
"anchored" at an older LSN, and internally in the page server when you
branch at an older point in time. How do you do that?

For now, I'm not considering incremental snapshots at all. I don't
think that changes things. So whenever you create a snapshot or a
snapshot file, it contains an image of all the pages, there is no need
to look at an older snapshot file.

Also, I'm imagining that this works on a per-relation basis, so that
each snapshot file contains data for one relation. A "relation" is a
fuzzy concept - it could actually be one 1 GB relation segment. Or it
could include all the different "forks" of a relation, or you could
treat each fork as a separate relation for storage purpose. And once
we have the "non-relational" work is finished, a "relation" could
actually mean some other versioned object kept in the PostgreSQL data
directory. Let's ignore that for now.

# Eric's RFC:

Every now and then, you create a "snapshot". It means that you create
a new snapshot file for each relation that was modified after the last
snapshot, and write out the contents the relation as it is/was at the
snapshot LSN. Write-ahead log is stored separately in S3 by the WAL
safekeeping service, in the original PostgreSQL WAL file format.

    SNAPSHOT @100       WAL
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @200        |
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @300        |
       .                 |
       .                 V
    IN-MEMORY @400

If a GetPage@LSN request comes from the primary, you return the latest
page from the in-memory layer. If there is no trace of the page in
memory, it means that it hasn't been modified since the last snapshot,
so you return the page from the latest snapshot, at LSN 300 in the
above example.

PITR is implemented using the original WAL files:

If a GetPage@LSN request comes from a read replica with LSN 250, you
read the image of the page from the snapshot at LSN 200, and you also
scan the WAL between 200 and 250, and apply all WAL records for the
requested page, to reconstruct it at LSN 250.

Scanning the WAL naively for every GetPage@LSN request would be
expensive, so in practice you'd construct an in-memory data structure
of all the WAL between 200 and 250 once that allows quickly looking up
records for a given page.

## Problems/questions

I think you'll need to store the list of snapshot LSNs on each
timeline somewhere.

If the latest snapshot of a relation is at LSN 100, and you request a
page at LSN 1000000, how do you know if there are some modifications
to it between 100 and 1000000 that you need to replay? You can scan
all the WAL between 100 and 1000000, but that would be expensive.

You can skip that, if you know that a snapshot was taken e.g. at LSN
999900. Then you know that the fact that there is no snapshot file at
999900 means that the relation hasn't been modified between
100-999900.  Then you only need to scan the WAL between 999900 and
1000000. However, there is no trace of a snapshot happening at LSN
999900 in the snapshot file for this relation, so you need to get
that information from somewhere else.

Where do you get that information from? Perhaps you can scan all the
other relations, and if you see a snapshot file for *any* relation at
LSN 999900, you know that if there were modifications to this
relation, there would be a newer snapshot file for it, too. In other
words, the list of snapshots that have been taken can be constructed
by scanning all relations and computing the union of all snapshot LSNs
that you see for any relation. But that's expensive so at least you
should keep that in memory, after computing it once. Also, if you rely
on that, it's not possible to have snapshots at different intervals
for different files. That seems limiting.

Another option is to explicitly store a list of snapshot LSNs in a
separate metadata file.


# Current implementation in the 'layered_repo' branch:

We store snapshot files like in the RFC, but each snapshot file also
contains all the WAL in the range of LSNs, so that you don't need to
fetch the WAL separately from S3. So you have "layers" like this:

    SNAPSHOT+WAL 100-200
          |
          |
          |
          |
    SNAPSHOT+WAL 200-300
          |
          |
          |
          |
    IN-MEMORY 300-

Each "snapshot+WAL" is a file that contains a snapshot - i.e. full
copy of each page in the relation, at the *start* LSN. In addition to
that, it contains all the WAL applicable to the relation from the
start LSN to the end LSN. With that, you can reconstruct any page
version in the range that the file covers.


## Problems/questions

I can see one potential performance issue here, compared to the RFC.
Let's focus on a single relation for now. Imagine that you start from
an empty relation, and you receive WAL from 100 to 200, containing
a bunch of inserts and updates to the relation. You now have all that
WAL in memory:

    memory:  WAL from 100-200

We decide that it's time to materialize that to a snapshot file on
disk.  We materialize full image of the relation as it was at LSN 100
to the snapshot file, and include all of the WAL. Since the relation
was initially empty, the "image" at the beginning of th range is empty
too.

So now you have one file on on disk:

    SNAPSHOT+WAL 100-200

It contains a full image of the relation at LSN 100 and all WAL
between 100-200. (It's actually stored as a serialized BTreeMap of
page versions, with the page images and WAL records all stored
together in the same BtreeMap. But for this story, that's not
important.)

We now receive more WAL updating the relation, up to LSN 300. We
decide it's time to materialize a new snapshot file, and we now have
two files:

    SNAPSHOT+WAL 100-200
    SNAPSHOT+WAL 200-300

Note that the latest "full snapshot" that we store on disk always lags
behind by one snapshot cycle. The first file contains a full image of
the relation at LSN 100, the second at LSN 200. When we have received
WAL up to LSN 300, we write a materialized image at LSN 200. That
seems a bit silly. In the design per your RFC, you would write a
snapshots at LSNs 200 and 300, instead. That seems better.



# Third option (not implemented yet)

Store snapshot files like in the RFC, but also store per-relation
WAL files that contain WAL in a range of LSNs for that relation.

    SNAPSHOT @100   WAL 100-200
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @200   WAL 200-300
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @300
       .
       .
    IN-MEMORY 300-


This could be the best of both worlds. The snapshot files would be
independent of the PostgreSQL WAL format. When it's time to write
snapshot file @300, you write a full image of the relation at LSN 300,
and you write the WAL that you had accumulated between 200 and 300 to
a separate file. That way, you don't "lag behind" for one snapshot
cycle like in the current implementation. But you still have the WAL
for a particular relation readily available alongside the snapshot
files, and you don't need to track what snapshot LSNs exist
separately.

(If we wanted to minimize the number of files, you could include the
snapshot @300 and the WAL between 200 and 300 in the same file, but I
feel it's probably better to keep them separate)



# Further thoughts

There's no fundamental reason why the LSNs of the snapshot files and the
ranges of the WAL files would need to line up. So this would be possible
too:

    SNAPSHOT @100   WAL 100-150
       .                 |
       .                 |
       .            WAL 150-250
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @200        |
       .                 |
       .            WAL 250-400
       .                 |
       .                 |
    SNAPSHOT @300        |

I'm not sure what the benefit of this would be. You could materialize
additional snapshot files in the middle of a range covered by a WAL
file, maybe? Might be useful to speed up access when you create a new
branch in the middle of an LSN range or if there's some other reason
to believe that a particular LSN is "interesting" and there will be
a lot of requests using it.

# Snapshot-first storage architecture

Goals:
- Long-term storage of database pages.
- Easy snapshots; simple snapshot and branch management.
- Allow cloud-based snapshot/branch management.
- Allow cloud-centric branching; decouple branch state from running pageserver.
- Allow customer ownership of data via s3 permissions.
- Provide same or better performance for typical workloads, vs plain postgres.

Non-goals:
- Service database reads from s3 (reads should be serviced from the pageserver cache).
- Keep every version of every page / Implement point-in-time recovery (possibly a future paid feature, based on WAL replay from an existing snapshot).

## Principle of operation

The database “lives in s3”. This means that all of the long term page storage is in s3, and the “live database”-- the version that lives in the pageserver-- is a set of “dirty pages” that haven’t yet been written back to s3.

In practice, this is mostly similar to storing frequent snapshots to s3 of a database that lives primarily elsewhere.

The main difference is that s3 is authoritative about which branches exist; pageservers consume branches, snapshots, and related metadata by reading them from s3. This allows cloud-based management of branches and snapshots, regardless of whether a pageserver is running or not.

It’s expected that a pageserver should keep a copy of all pages, to shield users from s3 latency. A cheap/slow pageserver that falls back to s3 for some reads would be possible, but doesn’t seem very useful right now.

Because s3 keeps all history, and the safekeeper(s) preserve any WAL records needed to reconstruct the most recent changes, the pageserver can store dirty pages in RAM or using non-durable local storage; this should allow very good write performance, since there is no need for fsync or journaling.

Objects in s3 are immutable snapshots, never to be modified once written (only deleted).

Objects in s3 are files, each containing a set of pages for some branch/relation/segment as of a specific time (LSN). A snapshot could be complete (meaning it has a copy of every page), or it could be incremental (containing only the pages that were modified since the previous snapshot). It’s expected that most snapshots are incremental to keep storage costs low.

It’s expected that the pageserver would upload new snapshot objects frequently, e.g. somewhere between 30 seconds and 15 minutes, depending on cost/performance balance.

No-longer needed snapshots can be “squashed”-- meaning snapshot N and snapshot N+1 can be read by some cloud agent software, which writes out a new object containing the combined set of pages (keeping only the newest version of each page) and then deletes the original snapshots.

A pageserver only needs to store the set of pages needed to satisfy operations in flight: if a snapshot is still being written, the pageserver needs to hold historical pages so that snapshot captures a consistent moment in time (similar to what is needed to satisfy a slow replica).

WAL records can be discarded once a snapshot has been stored to s3. (Unless we want to keep them longer as part of a point-in-time recovery feature.)

## Pageserver operation

To start a pageserver from a stored snapshot, the pageserver downloads a set of snapshots sufficient to start handling requests. We assume this includes the latest copy of every page, though it might be possible to start handling requests early, and retrieve pages for the first time only when needed.

To halt a pageserver, one final snapshot should be written containing all pending WAL updates; then the pageserver and safekeepers can shut down.

It’s assumed there is some cloud management service that ensures only one pageserver is active and servicing writes to a given branch.

The pageserver needs to be able to track whether a given page has been modified since the last snapshot, and should be able to produce the set of dirty pages efficiently to create a new snapshot.

The pageserver need only store pages that are “reachable” from a particular LSN. For example, a page may be written four times, at LSN 100, 200, 300, and 400. If no snapshot is being created when LSN 200 is written, the page at LSN 100 can be discarded. If a snapshot is triggered when the pageserver is at LSN 299, the pageserver must preserve the page from LSN 200 until that snapshot is complete. As before, the page at LSN 300 can be discarded when the LSN 400 pages is written (regardless of whether the LSN 200 snapshot has completed.)

If the pageserver is servicing multiple branches, those branches may contain common history. While it would be possible to serve branches with zero knowledge of their common history, a pageserver could save a lot of space using an awareness of branch history to share the common set of pages. Computing the “liveness” of a historical page may be tricky in the face of multiple branches.

The pageserver may store dirty pages to memory or to local block storage; any local block storage format is only temporary “overflow” storage, and is not expected to be readable by future software versions.

The pageserver may store clean pages (those that are captured in a snapshot) any way it likes: in memory, in a local filesystem (possibly keeping a local copy of the snapshot file), or using some custom storage format. Reading pages from s3 would be functional, but is expected to be prohibitively slow.

The mechanism for recovery after a pageserver failure is WAL redo. If we find that too slow in some situations (e.g. write-heavy workload causes long startup), we can write more frequent snapshots to keep the number of outstanding WAL records low. If that’s still not good enough, we could look at other options (e.g. redundant pageserver or an EBS page journal).

A read-only pageserver is possible; such a pageserver could be a read-only cache of a specific snapshot, or could auto-update to the latest snapshot on some branch. Either way, no safekeeper is required. Multiple read-only pageservers could exist for a single branch or snapshot.

## Cloud snapshot manager operation

Cloud software may wish to do the following operations (commanded by a user, or based on some pre-programmed policy or other cloud agent):
Create/delete/clone/rename a database
Create a new branch (possibly from a historical snapshot)
Start/stop the pageserver/safekeeper on a branch
List databases/branches/snapshots that are visible to this user account

Some metadata operations (e.g. list branches/snapshots of a particular db) could be performed by scanning the contents of a bucket and inspecting the file headers of each snapshot object. This might not be fast enough; it might be necessary to build a metadata service that can respond more quickly to some queries.

This is especially true if there are public databases: there may be many thousands of buckets that are public, and scanning all of them is not a practical strategy for answering metadata queries.

## Snapshot names, deletion and concurrency

There may be race conditions between operations-- in particular, a “squash” operation may replace two snapshot objects (A, B) with some combined object (C). Since C is logically equivalent to B, anything that attempts to access B should be able to seamlessly switch over to C. It’s assumed that concurrent delete won’t disrupt a read in flight, but it may be possible for some process to read B’s header, and then discover on the next operation that B is gone.

For this reason, any attempted read should attempt a fallback procedure (list objects; search list for an equivalent object) if an attempted read fails.  This requires a predictable naming scheme, e.g. `XXXX_YYYY_ZZZZ_DDDD`, where `XXXX` is the branch unique id, and `YYYY` and `ZZZZ` are the starting/ending LSN values.  `DDDD` is a timestamp indicating when the object was created; this is used to disambiguate a series of empty snapshots, or to help a snapshot policy engine understand which snapshots should be kept or discarded.

## Branching

A user may request a new branch from the cloud user interface. There is a sequence of things that needs to happen:
- If the branch is supposed to be based on the latest contents, the pageserver should perform an immediate snapshot. This is the parent snapshot for the new branch.
- Cloud software should create the new branch, by generating a new (random) unique branch identifier, and creating a placeholder snapshot object.
    - The placeholder object is an empty snapshot containing only metadata (which anchors it to the right parent history) and no pages.
    - The placeholder can be discarded when the first snapshot (containing data) is completed. Discarding is equivalent to squashing, when the snapshot contains no data.
- If the branch needs to be started immediately, a pageserver should be notified that it needs to start servicing the branch. This may not be the same pageserver that services the parent branch, though the common history may make it the best choice.

Some of these steps could be combined into the pageserver, but that process would not be possible under all cases (e.g. if no pageserver is currently running, or if the branch is based on an older snapshot, or if a different pageserver will be serving the new branch). Regardless of which software drives the process, the result should look the same.

## Long-term file format

Snapshot files (and any other object stored in s3) must be readable by future software versions.

It should be possible to build multiple tools (in addition to the pageserver) that can read and write this file format-- for example, to allow cloud snapshot management.

Files should contain the following metadata, in addition to the set of pages:
- The version of the file format.
- A unique identifier for this branch (should be worldwide-unique and unchanging).
- Optionally, any human-readable names assigned to this branch (for management UI/debugging/logging).
- For incremental snapshots, the identifier of the predecessor snapshot. For new branches, this will be the parent snapshot (the point at which history diverges).
- The location of the predecessor branch snapshot, if different from this branch’s location.
- The LSN range `(parent, latest]` for this snapshot. For complete snapshots, the parent LSN can be 0.
- The UTC timestamp of the snapshot creation (which may be different from the time of its highest LSN, if the database is idle).
- A SHA2 checksum over the entire file (excluding the checksum itself), to preserve file integrity.

A file may contain no pages, and an empty LSN range (probably `(latest, latest]`?), which serves as a placeholder for either a newly-created branch, or a snapshot of an idle database.

Any human-readable names stored in the file may fall out of date if database/branch renames are allowed; there may need to be a cloud metadata service to query (current name -> unique identifier). We may choose instead to not store human-readable names in the database, or treat them as debugging information only.

## S3 semantics, and other kinds of storage

For development and testing, it may be easier to use other kinds of storage in place of s3. For example, a directory full of files can substitute for an s3 bucket with multiple objects. This mode is expected to match the s3 semantics (e.g. don’t edit existing files or use symlinks). Unit tests may omit files entirely and use an in-memory mock bucket.

Some users may want to use a local or network filesystem in place of s3. This isn’t prohibited but it’s not a priority, either.

Alternate implementations of s3 should be supported, including Google Cloud Storage.

Azure Blob Storage should be supported. We assume (without evidence) that it’s semantically equivalent to s3 for this purpose.

The properties of s3 that we depend on are:
list objects
streaming read of entire object
read byte range from object
streaming write new object (may use multipart upload for better reliability)
delete object (that should not disrupt an already-started read).

Uploaded files, restored backups, or s3 buckets controlled by users could contain malicious content. We should always validate that objects contain the content they’re supposed to. Incorrect, Corrupt or malicious-looking contents should cause software (cloud tools, pageserver) to fail gracefully.

## Notes

Possible simplifications, for a first draft implementation:
- Assume that dirty pages fit in pageserver RAM. Can use kernel virtual memory to page out to disk if needed. Can improve this later.
- Don’t worry about the details of the squashing process yet.
- Don’t implement cloud metadata service; try to make everything work using basic s3 list-objects and reads.
- Don’t implement rename, delete at first.
- Don’t implement public/private, just use s3 permissions.
- Don’t worry about sharing history yet-- each user has their own bucket and a full copy of all data.
- Don’t worry about history that spans multiple buckets.
- Don’t worry about s3 regions.
- Don’t support user-writeable s3 buckets; users get only read-only access at most.

Open questions:
- How important is point-in-time recovery? When should we add this? How should it work?
- Should snapshot files use compression?
- Should we use snapshots for async replication? A spare pageserver could stay mostly warmed up by consuming snapshots as they’re created.
- Should manual snapshots, or snapshots triggered by branch creation, be named differently from snapshots that are triggered by a snapshot policy?
- When a new branch is created, should it always be served by the same pageserver that owns its parent branch? When should we start a new pageserver?
- How can pageserver software upgrade be done with minimal downtime?

# Storage details

Here I tried to describe the current state of thinking about our storage subsystem as I understand it. Feel free to correct me. Also, I tried to address items from Heikki's TODO and be specific on some of the details.

## Overview

![storage](images/storage.jpeg)

### MemStore

MemStore holds the data between `latest_snapshot_lsn` and `latest_lsn`. It consists of PageIndex that holds references to WAL records or pages, PageStore that stores recently materialized pages, and WalStore that stores recently received WAL.

### PageIndex

PageIndex is an ordered collection that maps `(BufferTag, LSN)` to one of the following references (by reference I mean some information that is needed to access that data, e.g. file_id and offset):

* PageStoreRef -- page offset in the PageStore
* LocalStoreRef -- snapshot_id and page offset inside of that snapshot
* WalStoreRef -- offset (and size optionally) of WalRecord in WalStore

PageIndex holds information about all the pages in all incremental snapshots and in the latest full snapshot. If we aren't using page compression inside snapshots we actually can avoid storing references to the full snapshot and calculate page offsets based on relation sizes metadata in the full snapshot (assuming that full snapshot stores pages sorted by page number). However, I would suggest embracing page compression from the beginning and treat all pages as variable-sized.

We assume that PageIndex is few orders of magnitude smaller than addressed data hence it should fit memory. We also don't care about crash tolerance as we can rebuild it from snapshots metadata and WAL records from WalStore or/and Safekeeper.

### WalStore

WalStore is a queue of recent WalRecords. I imagine that we can store recent WAL the same way as Postgres does -- as 16MB files on disk. On top of that, we can add some fixed-size cache that would keep some amount of segments in memory.

For now, we may rely on the Safekeeper to safely store that recent WAL. But generally, I think we can pack all S3 operations into the page server so that it would be also responsible for the recent WAL pushdown to S3 (and Safekeeper may just delete WAL that was confirmed as S3-durable by the page server).

### PageStore

PageStore is storage for recently materialized pages (or in other words cache of getPage results). It is also can be implemented as a file-based queue with some memory cache on top of it.

There are few possible options for PageStore:

a) we just add all recently materialized pages there (so several versions of the same page can be stored there) -- that is more or less how it happens now with the current RocksDB implementation.

b) overwrite older pages with the newer pages -- if there is no replica we probably don't need older pages. During page overwrite, we would also need to change PageStoreRef back to WalStoreRef in PageIndex.

I imagine that newly created pages would just be added to the back of PageStore (again in queue-like fashion) and this way there wouldn't be any meaningful ordering inside of that queue. When we are forming a new incremental snapshot we may prohibit any updates to the current set of pages in PageStore (giving up on single page version rule) and cut off that whole set when snapshot creation is complete.

With option b) we can also treat PageStor as an uncompleted incremental snapshot.

### LocalStore

LocalStore keeps the latest full snapshot and set of incremental snapshots on top of it. We add new snapshots when the number of changed pages grows bigger than a certain threshold.

## Granularity

By granularity, I mean a set of pages that goes into a certain full snapshot. Following things should be taken into account:

* can we shard big databases between page servers?
* how much time will we spend applying WAL to access certain pages with older LSN's?
* how many files do we create for a single database?

I can think of the following options here:

1. whole database goes to one full snapshot.
    * +: we never create a lot of files for one database
    * +: the approach is quite straightforward, moving data around is simple
    * -: can not be sharded
    * -: long recovery -- we always need to recover the whole database
2. table segment is the unit of snapshotting
    * +: straightforward for sharding
    * +: individual segment can be quickly recovered with sliced WAL
    * -: full snapshot can be really small (e.g. when the corresponding segment consists of a single page) and we can blow amount of files. Then we would spend eternity in directory scans and the amount of metadata for sharding can be also quite big.
3. range-partitioned snapshots -- snapshot includes all pages between [BuffTagLo, BuffTagHi] mixing different relations, databases, and potentially clusters (albeit from one tenant only). When full snapshot outgrows a certain limit (could be also a few gigabytes) we split the snapshot in two during the next full snapshot write. That approach would also require pages sorted by BuffTag inside our snapshots.
    * +: addresses all mentioned issues
    * -: harder to implement

I think it is okay to start with table segments granularity and just check how we will perform in cases of lots of small tables and check is there any way besides c) to deal with it.

Both PageStore and WalStore should be "sharded" by this granularity level.

## Security

We can generate different IAM keys for each tenant and potentially share them with users (in read-only mode?) or even allow users to provide their S3 buckets credentials.

Also, S3 backups are usually encrypted by per-tenant privates keys. I'm not sure in what threat model such encryption would improve something (taking into account per-tenant IAM keys), but it seems that everybody is doing that (both AMZN and YNDX). Most likely that comes as a requirement about "cold backups" by some certification procedure.

## Dynamics

### WAL stream handling

When a new WAL record is received we need to parse BufferTags in that record and insert them in PageIndex with WalStoreRef as a value.

### getPage queries

Look up the page in PageIndex. If the value is a page reference then just respond with that page. If the referenced value is WAL record then find the most recent page with the same BuffTag (that is why we need ordering in PageIndex); recover it by applying WAL records; save it in PageStore; respond with that page.

### Starting page server without local data

* build set of latest full snapshots and incremental snapshots on top of them
* load all their metadata into PageIndex
* Safekeeper should connect soon and we can ask for a WAL stream starting from the latest incremental snapshot
* for databases that are connected to us through the Safekeeper we can start loading the set of the latest snapshots or we can do that lazily based on getPage request (I'd better avoid doing that lazily for now without some access stats from the previous run and just transfer all data for active database from S3 to LocalStore).

### Starting page server with local data (aka restart or reboot)

* check that local snapshot files are consistent with S3

### Snapshot creation

Track size of future snapshots based on info in MemStore and when it exceeds some threshold (taking into account our granularity level) create a new incremental snapshot. Always emit incremental snapshots from MemStore.

To create a new snapshot we need to walk through WalStore to get the list of all changed pages, sort it, and get the latest versions of that pages from PageStore or by WAL replay. It makes sense to maintain that set in memory while we are receiving the WAL stream to avoid parsing WAL during snapshot creation.

Full snapshot creation can be done by GC (or we can call that entity differently -- e.g. merger?) by merging the previous full snapshot with several incremental snapshots.

### S3 pushdown

When we have several full snapshots GC can push the old one with its increments to S3.

### Branch creation

Create a new timeline and replay sliced WAL up to a requested point. When the page is not in PageIndex ask the parent timeline about a page. Relation sizes are tricky.

## File formats

As far as I understand Bookfile/Aversion addresses versioning and serialization parts.

As for exact data that should go to snapshots I think it is the following for each snapshot:

* format version number
* set of key/values to interpret content (e.g. is page compression enabled, is that a full or incremental snapshot, previous snapshot id, is there WAL at the end on file, etc) -- it is up to a reader to decide what to do if some keys are missing or some unknown key are present. If we add something backward compatible to the file we can keep the version number.
* array of [BuffTag, corresponding offset in file] for pages -- IIUC that is analogous to ToC in Bookfile
* array of [(BuffTag, LSN), corresponding offset in file] for the WAL records
* pages, one by one
* WAL records, one by one

It is also important to be able to load metadata quickly since it would be one of the main factors impacting the time of page server start. E.g. if would store/cache about 10TB of data per page server, the size of uncompressed page references would be about 30GB (10TB / ( 8192 bytes page size / ( ~18 bytes per ObjectTag + 8 bytes offset in the file))).

1) Since our ToC/array of entries can be sorted by ObjectTag we can store the whole BufferTag only when relation_id is changed and store only delta-encoded offsets for a given relation. That would reduce the average per-page metadata size to something less than 4 bytes instead of 26 (assuming that pages would follow the same order and offset deltas would be small).
2) It makes sense to keep ToC at the beginning of the file to avoid extra seeks to locate it. Doesn't matter too much with the local files but matters on S3 -- if we are accessing a lot of ~1Gb files with the size of metadata ~ 1Mb then the time to transfer this metadata would be comparable with access latency itself (which is about a half of a second). So by slurping metadata with one read of file header instead of N reads we can improve the speed of page server start by this N factor.

I think both of that optimizations can be done later, but that is something to keep in mind when we are designing our storage serialization routines.

Also, there were some discussions about how to embed WAL in incremental snapshots. So far following ideas were mentioned:
1. snapshot lsn=200, includes WAL in range 200-300
2. snapshot lsn=200, includes WAL in range 100-200
3. data snapshots are separated from WAL snapshots

Both options 2 and 3 look good. I'm inclined towards option 3 as it would allow us to apply different S3 pushdown strategies for data and WAL files (e.g. we may keep data snapshot until the next full snapshot, but we may push WAL snapshot to S3 just when they appeared if there are no replicas).


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/011-retention-policy.md:

# User-visible timeline history

The user can specify a retention policy. The retention policy is
presented to the user as a PITR period and snapshots. The PITR period
is the amount of recent history that needs to be retained, as minutes,
hours, or days. Within that period, you can create a branch or
snapshot at any point in time, open a compute node, and start running
queries. Internally, a PITR period is represented as a range of LSNs

The user can also create snapshots. A snapshot is a point in time,
internally represented by an LSN. The user gives the snapshot a name.

The user can also specify an interval, at which the system creates
snapshots automatically. For example, create a snapshot every night at
2 AM. After some user-specified time, old automatically created
snapshots are removed.

                     Snapshot       Snapshot
         PITR        "Monday"       "Tuesday"        PITR
    ----######----------+-------------+-------------######>

If there are multiple branches, you can specify different policies or
different branches.

The PITR period and user-visible snapshots together define the
retention policy.

NOTE: As presented here, this is probably overly flexible. In reality,
we want to keep the user interface simple. Only allow a PITR period at
the tip of a branch, for example. But that doesn't make much
difference to the internals.


# Retention policy behind the scenes

The retention policy consists of points (for snapshots) and ranges
(for PITR periods).

The system must be able to reconstruct any page within the retention
policy. Other page versions can be garbage collected away. We have a
lot of flexibility on when to perform the garbage collection and how
aggressive it is.


# Base images and WAL slices

The page versions are stored in two kinds of files: base images and
WAL slices. A base image contains a dump of all the pages of one
relation at a specific LSN. A WAL slice contains all the WAL in an LSN
range.


    |
    |
    |
    | --Base img @100   +
    |                   |
    |                   | WAL slice
    |                   | 100-200
    |                   |
    | --Base img @200   +
    |                   |
    |                   | WAL slice
    |                   | 200-300
    |                   |
    |                   +
    |
    V


To recover a page e.g. at LSN 150, you need the base image at LSN 100,
and the WAL slice 100-200.

All of this works at a per-relation or per-relation-segment basis. If
a relation is updated very frequently, we create base images and WAL
slices for it more quickly. For a relation that's updated
infrequently, we hold the recent WAL for that relation longer, and
only write it out when we need to release the disk space occupied by
the original WAL. (We need a backstop like that, because until all the
WAL/base images have been been durably copied to S3, we must keep the
original WAL for that period somewhere, in the WAL service or in S3.)


# Branching

Internally, branch points are also "retention points", in addition to
the user-visible snapshots. If a branch has been forked off at LSN
100, we need to be able to reconstruct any page on the parent branch
at that LSN, because it is needed by the child branch. If a page is
modified in the child, we don't need to keep that in the parent
anymore, though.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/012-background-tasks.md:

# Eviction

 Write out in-memory layer to disk, into a delta layer.

- To release memory
- To make it possible to advance disk_consistent_lsn and allow the WAL
  service to release some WAL.

- Triggered if we are short on memory
- Or if the oldest in-memory layer is so old that it's holding back
  the WAL service from removing old WAL

# Materialization

Create a new image layer of a segment, by performing WAL redo

- To reduce the amount of WAL that needs to be replayed on a GetPage request.
- To allow garbage collection of old layers

- Triggered by distance to last full image of a page

# Coalescing

Replace N consecutive layers of a segment with one larger layer.

- To reduce the number of small files that needs to be uploaded to S3


# Bundling

Zip together multiple small files belonging to different segments.

- To reduce the number of small files that needs to be uploaded to S3


# Garbage collection

Remove a layer that's older than the GC horizon, and isn't needed anymore.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/013-term-history.md:

# What

Currently, apart from WAL safekeeper persistently stores only two logical clock
counter (aka term) values, sourced from the same sequence. The first is bumped
whenever safekeeper gives vote to proposer (or acknowledges already elected one)
and e.g. prevents electing two proposers with the same term -- it is actually
called `term` in the code. The second, called `epoch`, reflects progress of log
receival and this might lag behind `term`; safekeeper switches to epoch `n` when
it has received all committed log records from all `< n` terms. This roughly
corresponds to proposed in

https://github.com/neondatabase/rfcs/pull/3/files


This makes our biggest our difference from Raft. In Raft, every log record is
stamped with term in which it was generated; while we essentially store in
`epoch` only the term of the highest record on this safekeeper -- when we know
it -- because during recovery generally we don't, and `epoch` is bumped directly
to the term of the proposer who performs the recovery when it is finished. It is
not immediately obvious that this simplification is safe. I thought and I still
think it is; model checking confirmed that. However, some details now make me
believe it is better to keep full term switching history (which is equivalent to
knowing term of each record).

# Why

Without knowing full history (list of <term, LSN> pairs) of terms it is hard to
determine the exact divergence point, and if we don't perform truncation at that
point safety becomes questionable. Consider the following history, with
safekeepers A, B, C, D, E. n_m means record created by proposer in term n with
LSN m; (t=x, e=y) means safekeeper currently has term x and epoch y.

1) P1 in term 1 writes 1.1 everywhere, which is committed, and some more only
on A.

<pre>
A(t=1, e=1) 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4
B(t=1, e=1) 1.1
C(t=1, e=1) 1.1
D(t=1, e=1) 1.1
E(t=1, e=1) 1.1
</pre>

2) P2 is elected by CDE in term 2, epochStartLsn is 2, and writes 2.2, 2.3 on CD:

<pre>
A(t=1, e=1) 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4
B(t=1, e=1) 1.1
C(t=2, e=2) 1.1 2.2 2.3
D(t=2, e=2) 1.1 2.2 2.3
E(t=2, e=1) 1.1
</pre>


3) P3 is elected by CDE in term 3, epochStartLsn is 4, and writes 3.4 on D:

<pre>
A(t=1, e=1) 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4
B(t=1, e=1) 1.1
C(t=3, e=2) 1.1 2.2 2.3
D(t=3, e=3) 1.1 2.2 2.3 3.4
E(t=3, e=1) 1.1
</pre>


Now, A gets back and P3 starts recovering it. How it should proceed? There are
two options.

## Don't try to find divergence point at all

...start sending WAL conservatively since the horizon (1.1), and truncate
obsolete part of WAL only when recovery is finished, i.e. epochStartLsn (4) is
reached, i.e. 2.3 transferred -- that's what https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/505 proposes.

Then the following is possible:

4) P3 moves one record 2.2 to A.

<pre>
A(t=1, e=1) 1.1 <b>2.2</b> 1.3 1.4
B(t=1, e=1) 1.1 1.2
C(t=3, e=2) 1.1 2.2 2.3
D(t=3, e=3) 1.1 2.2 2.3 3.4
E(t=3, e=1) 1.1
</pre>

Now log of A is basically corrupted. Moreover, since ABE are all in epoch 1 and
A's log is the longest one, they can elect P4 who will commit such log.

Note that this particular history couldn't happen if we forbid to *create* new
records in term n until majority of safekeepers switch to it. It would force CDE
to switch to 2 before 2.2 is created, and A could never become donor while his
log is corrupted. Generally with this additional barrier I believe the algorithm
becomes safe, but
 - I don't like this kind of artificial barrier;
 - I also feel somewhat discomfortable about even temporary having intentionally
   corrupted WAL;
 - I'd still model check the idea.

## Find divergence point and truncate at it

Then step 4 would delete 1.3 1.4 on A, and we are ok. The question is, how do we
do that? Without term switching history we have to resort to sending again since
the horizon and memcmp'ing records, which is inefficient and ugly. Or we can
maintain full history and determine truncation point by comparing 'wrong' and
'right' histories -- much like pg_rewind does -- and perform truncation + start
streaming right there.

# Proposal

- Add term history as array of <term, LSN> pairs to safekeeper controlfile.
- Return it to proposer with VoteResponse so 1) proposer can tell it to other
  nodes and 2) determine personal streaming starting point. However, since we
  don't append WAL and update controlfile atomically, let's first always update
  controlfile but send only the history of what we really have (up to highest
  term in history where begin_lsn >= end of wal; this highest term replaces
  current `epoch`). We also send end of wal as we do now to determine the donor.
- Create ProposerAnnouncement message which proposer sends before starting
  streaming. It announces proposer as elected and
  1) Truncates wrong part of WAL on safekeeper
     (divergence point is already calculated at proposer, but can be
     cross-verified here).
  2) Communicates the 'right' history of its term (taken from donor). Seems
     better to immediately put the history in the controlfile,
	 though safekeeper might not have full WAL for previous terms in it --
	 this way is simpler, and we can't update WAL and controlfile atomically anyway.

	 This also constitutes analogue of current epoch bump for those safekeepers
     which don't need recovery, which is important for sync-safekeepers (bump
     epoch without waiting records from new term).
- After ProposerAnnouncement proposer streams WAL since calculated starting
  point -- only what is missing.


pros/cons:
+ (more) clear safety of WAL truncation -- we get very close to Raft
+ no unnecessary data sending (faster recovery for not-oldest-safekeepers, matters
   only for 5+ nodes)
+ adds some observability at safekeepers

- complexity, but not that much


# Misc

- During model checking I did truncation on first locally non existent or
  different record -- analogue of 'memcmp' variant described above.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/014-safekeepers-gossip.md:

# Safekeeper gossip

Extracted from this [PR](https://github.com/neondatabase/rfcs/pull/13)

## Motivation

In some situations, safekeeper (SK) needs coordination with other SK's that serve the same tenant:

1. WAL deletion. SK needs to know what WAL was already safely replicated to delete it. Now we keep WAL indefinitely.
2. Deciding on who is sending WAL to the pageserver. Now sending SK crash may lead to a livelock where nobody sends WAL to the pageserver.
3. To enable SK to SK direct recovery without involving the compute

## Summary

Compute node has connection strings to each safekeeper. During each compute->safekeeper connection establishment, the compute node should pass down all that connection strings to each safekeeper. With that info, safekeepers may establish Postgres connections to each other and periodically send ping messages with LSN payload.

## Components

safekeeper, compute, compute<->safekeeper protocol, possibly console (group SK addresses)

## Proposed implementation

Each safekeeper can periodically ping all its peers and share connectivity and liveness info. If the ping was not receiver for, let's say, four ping periods, we may consider sending safekeeper as dead. That would mean some of the alive safekeepers should connect to the pageserver. One way to decide which one exactly: `make_connection = my_node_id == min(alive_nodes)`

Since safekeepers are multi-tenant, we may establish either per-tenant physical connections or per-safekeeper ones. So it makes sense to group "logical" connections between corresponding tenants on different nodes into a single physical connection. That means that we should implement an interconnect thread that maintains physical connections and periodically broadcasts info about all tenants.

Right now console may assign any 3 SK addresses to a given compute node. That may lead to a high number of gossip connections between SK's. Instead, we can assign safekeeper triples to the compute node. But if we want to "break"/" change" group by an ad-hoc action, we can do it.

### Corner cases

- Current safekeeper may be alive but may not have connectivity to the pageserver

  To address that, we need to gossip visibility info. Based on that info, we may define SK as alive only when it can connect to the pageserver.

- Current safekeeper may be alive but may not have connectivity with the compute node.

  We may broadcast last_received_lsn and presence of compute connection and decide who is alive based on that.

- It is tricky to decide when to shut down gossip connections because we need to be sure that pageserver got all the committed (in the distributed sense, so local SK info is not enough) records, and it may never lose them. It is not a strict requirement since `--sync-safekeepers` that happen before the compute start will allow the pageserver to consume missing WAL, but it is better to do that in the background. So the condition may look like that: `majority_max(flush_lsn) == pageserver_s3_lsn` Here we rely on the two facts:
    - that `--sync-safekeepers` happened after the compute shutdown, and it advanced local commit_lsn's allowing pageserver to consume that WAL.

    - we wait for the `pageserver_s3_lsn` advancement to avoid pageserver's last_received_lsn/disk_consistent_lsn going backward due to the disk/hardware failure and subsequent S3 recovery

    If those conditions are not met, we will have some gossip activity (but that may be okay).

## Pros/cons

Pros:

- distributed, does not introduce new services (like etcd), does not add console as a storage dependency
- lays the foundation for gossip-based recovery

Cons:

- Only compute knows a set of safekeepers, but they should communicate even without compute node. In case of safekeepers restart, we will lose that info and can't gossip anymore. Hence we can't trim some WAL tail until the compute node start. Also, it is ugly.

- If the console assigns a random set of safekeepers to each Postgres, we may end up in a situation where each safekeeper needs to have a connection with all other safekeepers. We can group safekeepers into isolated triples in the console to avoid that. Then "mixing" would happen only if we do rebalancing.

## Alternative implementation

We can have a selected node (e.g., console) with everybody reporting to it.

## Security implications

We don't increase the attack surface here. Communication can happen in a private network that is not exposed to users.

## Scalability implications

The only thing that may grow as we grow the number of computes is the number of gossip connections. But if we group safekeepers and assign a compute node to the random SK triple, the number of connections would be constant.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/014-storage-lsm.md:

# Why LSM trees?

In general, an LSM tree has the nice property that random updates are
fast, but the disk writes are sequential. When a new file is created,
it is immutable. New files are created and old ones are deleted, but
existing files are never modified. That fits well with storing the
files on S3.

Currently, we create a lot of small files. That is mostly a problem
with S3, because each GET/PUT operation is expensive, and LIST
operation only returns 1000 objects at a time, and isn't free
either. Currently, the files are "archived" together into larger
checkpoint files before they're uploaded to S3 to alleviate that
problem, but garbage collecting data from the archive files would be
difficult and we have not implemented it. This proposal addresses that
problem.

# Memtable

When new WAL arrives, it is first put into the Memtable. Despite the
name, the Memtable is not a purely in-memory data structure. It can
spill to a temporary file on disk if the system is low on memory, and
is accessed through a buffer cache.

If the page server crashes, the Memtable is lost. It is rebuilt by
processing again the WAL that's newer than the latest layer in L0.

The size of the Memtable is configured by the "checkpoint distance"
setting. Because anything that hasn't been flushed to disk and
uploaded to S3 yet needs to be kept in the safekeeper, the "checkpoint
distance" also determines the amount of WAL that needs to kept in the
safekeeper.

# L0

When the Memtable fills up, it is written out to a new file in L0. The
files are immutable; when a file is created, it is never
modified. Each file in L0 is roughly 1 GB in size (*). Like the
Memtable, each file in L0 covers the whole key range.

When enough files have been accumulated in L0, compaction
starts. Compaction processes all the files in L0 and reshuffles the
data to create a new set of files in L1.


(*) except in corner cases like if we want to shut down the page
server and want to flush out the memtable to disk even though it's not
full yet.


# L1

L1 consists of ~ 1 GB files like L0. But each file covers only part of
the overall key space, and a larger range of LSNs. This speeds up
searches. When you're looking for a given page, you need to check all
the files in L0, to see if they contain a page version for the requested
page. But in L1, you only need to check the files whose key range covers
the requested page. This is particularly important at cold start, when
checking a file means downloading it from S3.

Partitioning by key range also helps with garbage collection. If only a
part of the database is updated, we will accumulate more files for
the hot part in L1, and old files can be removed without affecting the
cold part.


# Image layers

So far, we've only talked about delta layers. In addition to the delta
layers, we create image layers, when "enough" WAL has been accumulated
for some part of the database. Each image layer covers a 1 GB range of
key space. It contains images of the pages at a single LSN, a snapshot
if you will.

The exact heuristic for what "enough" means is not clear yet. Maybe
create a new image layer when 10 GB of WAL has been accumulated for a
1 GB segment.

The image layers limit the number of layers that a search needs to
check. That put a cap on read latency, and it also allows garbage
collecting layers that are older than the GC horizon.


# Partitioning scheme

When compaction happens and creates a new set of files in L1, how do
we partition the data into the files?

- Goal is that each file is ~ 1 GB in size
- Try to match partition boundaries at relation boundaries. (See [1]
  for how PebblesDB does this, and for why that's important)
- Greedy algorithm

# Storage messaging

Created on 19.01.22

Initially created [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/rfcs/pull/16) by @kelvich.

That it is an alternative to (014-safekeeper-gossip)[]

## Motivation

As in 014-safekeeper-gossip we need to solve the following problems:

* Trim WAL on safekeepers
* Decide on which SK should push WAL to the S3
* Decide on which SK should forward WAL to the pageserver
* Decide on when to shut down SK<->pageserver connection

This RFC suggests a more generic and hopefully more manageable way to address those problems. However, unlike 014-safekeeper-gossip, it does not bring us any closer to safekeeper-to-safekeeper recovery but rather unties two sets of different issues we previously wanted to solve with gossip.

Also, with this approach, we would not need "call me maybe" anymore, and the pageserver will have all the data required to understand that it needs to reconnect to another safekeeper.

## Summary

Instead of p2p gossip, let's have a centralized broker where all the storage nodes report per-timeline state. Each storage node should have a `--broker-url=1.2.3.4` CLI param.

Here I propose two ways to do that. After a lot of arguing with myself, I'm leaning towards the etcd approach. My arguments for it are in the pros/cons section. Both options require adding a Grpc client in our codebase either directly or as an etcd dependency.

## Non-goals

That RFC does *not* suggest moving the compute to pageserver and compute to safekeeper mappings out of the console. The console is still the only place in the cluster responsible for the persistency of that info. So I'm implying that each pageserver and safekeeper exactly knows what timelines he serves, as it currently is. We need some mechanism for a new pageserver to discover mapping info, but that is out of the scope of this RFC.

## Impacted components

pageserver, safekeeper
adds either etcd or console as a storage dependency

## Possible implementation: custom message broker in the console

We've decided to go with an etcd approach instead of the message broker.

<details closed>
<summary>Original suggestion</summary>
<br>
We can add a Grpc service in the console that acts as a message broker since the console knows the addresses of all the components. The broker can ignore the payload and only redirect messages. So, for example, each safekeeper may send a message to the peering safekeepers or to the pageserver responsible for a given timeline.

Message format could be `{sender, destination, payload}`.

The destination is either:
1. `sk_#{tenant}_#{timeline}` -- to be broadcasted on all safekeepers, responsible for that timeline, or
2. `pserver_#{tenant}_#{timeline}` -- to be broadcasted on all pageservers, responsible for that timeline

Sender is either:
1. `sk_#{sk_id}`, or
2. `pserver_#{pserver_id}`

I can think of the following behavior to address our original problems:

* WAL trimming
  Each safekeeper periodically broadcasts `(write_lsn, commit_lsn)` to all peering (peering == responsible for that timeline) safekeepers

* Decide on which SK should push WAL to the S3

  Each safekeeper periodically broadcasts `i_am_alive_#{current_timestamp}` message to all peering safekeepers. That way, safekeepers may maintain the vector of alive peers (loose one, with false negatives). Alive safekeeper with the minimal id pushes data to S3.

* Decide on which SK should forward WAL to the pageserver

  Each safekeeper periodically sends (write_lsn, commit_lsn, compute_connected) to the relevant pageservers. With that info, pageserver can maintain a view of the safekeepers state, connect to a random one, and detect the moments (e.g., one the safekeepers is not making progress or down) when it needs to reconnect to another safekeeper. Pageserver should resolve exact IP addresses through the console, e.g., exchange `#sk_#{sk_id}` to `4.5.6.7:6400`.

  Pageserver connection to the safekeeper triggered by the state change `compute_connected: false -> true`. With that, we don't need "call me maybe" anymore.

  Also, we don't have a "peer address amnesia" problem as in the gossip approach (with gossip, after a simultaneous reboot, safekeepers wouldn't know each other addresses until the next compute connection).

* Decide on when to shutdown sk<->pageserver connection

  Again, pageserver would have all the info to understand when to shut down the safekeeper connection.

### Scalability

One node is enough (c) No, seriously, it is enough.

### High Availability

Broker lives in the console, so we can rely on k8s maintaining the console app alive.

If the console is down, we won't trim WAL and reconnect the pageserver to another safekeeper. But, at the same, if the console is down, we already can't accept new compute connections and start stopped computes, so we are making things a bit worse, but not dramatically.

```
</details>


## Implementation: etcd state store

Alternatively, we can set up `etcd` and maintain the following data structure in it:

```ruby
"compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}" => {
    safekeepers => {
        "sk_#{sk_id}" => {
            write_lsn: "0/AEDF130",
            commit_lsn: "0/AEDF100",
            compute_connected: true,
            last_updated: 1642621138,
        },
    }
}
```

As etcd doesn't support field updates in the nested objects that translates to the following set of keys:

```ruby
"compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}/safekeepers/sk_#{sk_id}/write_lsn",
"compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}/safekeepers/sk_#{sk_id}/commit_lsn",
...
```

Each storage node can subscribe to the relevant sets of keys and maintain a local view of that structure. So in terms of the data flow, everything is the same as in the previous approach. Still, we can avoid implementing the message broker and prevent runtime storage dependency on a console.

### Safekeeper address discovery

During the startup safekeeper should publish the address he is listening on as the part of `{"sk_#{sk_id}" => ip_address}`. Then the pageserver can resolve `sk_#{sk_id}` to the actual address. This way it would work both locally and in the cloud setup. Safekeeper should have `--advertised-address` CLI option so that we can listen on e.g. 0.0.0.0 but advertise something more useful.

### Safekeeper behavior

For each timeline safekeeper periodically broadcasts `compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}/safekeepers/sk_#{sk_id}/*` fields. It subscribes to changes of `compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}` -- that way safekeeper will have an information about peering safekeepers.
That amount of information is enough to properly trim WAL. To decide on who is pushing the data to S3 safekeeper may use etcd leases or broadcast a timestamp and hence track who is alive.

### Pageserver behavior

Pageserver subscribes to `compute_#{tenant}_#{timeline}` for each tenant it owns. With that info, pageserver can maintain a view of the safekeepers state, connect to a random one, and detect the moments (e.g., one the safekeepers is not making progress or down) when it needs to reconnect to another safekeeper. Pageserver should resolve exact IP addresses through the console, e.g., exchange `#sk_#{sk_id}` to `4.5.6.7:6400`.

Pageserver connection to the safekeeper can be triggered by the state change `compute_connected: false -> true`. With that, we don't need "call me maybe" anymore.

As an alternative to compute_connected, we can track timestamp of the latest message arrived to safekeeper from compute. Usually compute broadcasts KeepAlive to all safekeepers every second, so it'll be updated every second when connection is ok. Then the connection can be considered down when this timestamp isn't updated for a several seconds.

This will help to faster detect issues with safekeeper (and switch to another) in the following cases:

      when compute failed but TCP connection stays alive until timeout (usually about a minute)
      when safekeeper failed and didn't set compute_connected to false

Another way to deal with [2] is to process (write_lsn, commit_lsn, compute_connected) as a KeepAlive on the pageserver side and detect issues when sk_id don't send anything for some time. This way is fully compliant to this RFC.

Also, we don't have a "peer address amnesia" problem as in the gossip approach (with gossip, after a simultaneous reboot, safekeepers wouldn't know each other addresses until the next compute connection).

# Pros/cons

## Console broker/etcd vs gossip:

Gossip pros:
* gossip allows running storage without the console or etcd

Console broker/etcd pros:
* simpler
* solves "call me maybe" as well
* avoid possible N-to-N connection issues with gossip without grouping safekeepers in pre-defined triples

## Console broker vs. etcd:

Initially, I wanted to avoid etcd as a dependency mostly because I've seen how painful for Clickhouse was their ZooKeeper dependency: in each chat, at each conference, people were complaining about configuration and maintenance barriers with ZooKeeper. It was that bad that ClickHouse re-implemented ZooKeeper to embed it: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/clickhouse-keeper/.

But with an etcd we are in a bit different situation:

1. We don't need persistency and strong consistency guarantees for the data we store in the etcd
2. etcd uses Grpc as a protocol, and messages are pretty simple

So it looks like implementing in-mem store with etcd interface is straightforward thing _if we will want that in future_. At the same time, we can avoid implementing it right now, and we will be able to run local neon installation with etcd running somewhere in the background (as opposed to building and running console, which in turn requires Postgres).


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/016-connection-routing.md:

# Dispatching a connection

For each client connection, Neon service needs to authenticate the
connection, and route it to the right PostgreSQL instance.

## Authentication

There are three different ways to authenticate:

- anonymous; no authentication needed
- PostgreSQL authentication
- github single sign-on using browser

In anonymous access, the user doesn't need to perform any
authentication at all. This can be used e.g. in interactive PostgreSQL
documentation, allowing you to run the examples very quickly. Similar
to sqlfiddle.com.

PostgreSQL authentication works the same as always. All the different
PostgreSQL authentication options like SCRAM, kerberos, etc. are
available. [1]

The third option is to authenticate with github single sign-on. When
you open the connection in psql, you get a link that you open with
your browser. Opening the link redirects you to github authentication,
and lets the connection to proceed. This is also known as "Link auth" [2].


## Routing the connection

When a client starts a connection, it needs to be routed to the
correct PostgreSQL instance. Routing can be done by the proxy, acting
as a man-in-the-middle, or the connection can be routed at the network
level based on the hostname or IP address.

Either way, Neon needs to identify which PostgreSQL instance the
connection should be routed to. If the instance is not already
running, it needs to be started. Some connections always require a new
PostgreSQL instance to be created, e.g. if you want to run a one-off
query against a particular point-in-time.

The PostgreSQL instance is identified by:
- Neon account (possibly anonymous)
- cluster (known as tenant in the storage?)
- branch or snapshot name
- timestamp (PITR)
- primary or read-replica
- one-off read replica
- one-off writeable branch

When you are using regular PostgreSQL authentication or anonymous
access, the connection URL needs to contain all the information needed
for the routing. With github single sign-on, the browser is involved
and some details - the Neon account in particular - can be deduced
from the authentication exchange.

There are three methods for identifying the PostgreSQL instance:

- Browser interaction (link auth)
- Options in the connection URL and the domain name
- A pre-defined endpoint, identified by domain name or IP address

### Link Auth

    postgres://<username>@start.neon.tech/<dbname>

This gives you a link that you open in browser. Clicking the link
performs github authentication, and the Neon account name is
provided to the proxy behind the scenes. The proxy routes the
connection to the primary PostgreSQL instance in cluster called
"main", branch "main".

Further ideas:
- You could pre-define a different target for link auth
  connections in the UI.
- You could have a drop-down in the browser, allowing you to connect
  to any cluster you want. Link Auth can be like Teleport.

### Connection URL

The connection URL looks like this:

    postgres://<username>@<cluster-id>.db.neon.tech/<dbname>

By default, this connects you to the primary PostgreSQL instance
running on the "main" branch in the named cluster [3]. However, you can
change that by specifying options in the connection URL. The following
options are supported:

| option name  | Description                                                                                       | Examples                                            |
| ---          | ---                                                                                               | ---                                                 |
| cluster      | Cluster name                                                                                      | cluster:myproject                                   |
| branch       | Branch name                                                                                       | branch:main                                         |
| timestamp    | Connect to an instance at given point-in-time.                                                    | timestamp:2022-04-08 timestamp:2022-04-08T11:42:16Z |
| lsn          | Connect to an instance at given LSN                                                               | lsn:0/12FF0420                                      |
| read-replica | Connect to a read-replica. If the parameter is 'new', a new instance is created for this session. | read-replica read-replica:new                       |

For example, to read branch 'testing' as it was on Mar 31, 2022, you could
specify a timestamp in the connection URL [4]:

    postgres://alice@cluster-1234.db.neon.tech/postgres?options=branch:testing,timestamp:2022-03-31

Connecting with cluster name and options can be disabled in the UI. If
disabled, you can only connect using a pre-defined endpoint.

### Pre-defined Endpoint

Instead of providing the cluster name, branch, and all those options
in the connection URL, you can define a named endpoint with the same
options.

In the UI, click "create endpoint". Fill in the details:

- Cluster name
- Branch
- timestamp or LSN
- is this for the primary or for a read replica
- etc.

When you click Finish, a named endpoint is created. You can now use the endpoint ID to connect:

    postgres://<username>@<endpoint-id>.endpoint.neon.tech/<dbname>


An endpoint can be assigned a static or dynamic IP address, so that
you can connect to it with clients that don't support TLS SNI. Maybe
bypass the proxy altogether, but that ought to be invisible to the
user.

You can limit the range of source IP addresses that are allowed to
connect to an endpoint. An endpoint can also be exposed in an Amazon
VPC, allowing direct connections from applications.


# Footnotes

[1] I'm not sure how feasible it is to set up configure like Kerberos
or LDAP in a cloud environment. But in principle I think we should
allow customers to have the full power of PostgreSQL, including all
authentication options. However, it's up to the customer to configure
it correctly.

[2] Link is a way to both authenticate and to route the connection

[3] This assumes that cluster-ids are globally unique, across all
Neon accounts.

[4] The syntax accepted in the connection URL is limited by libpq. The
only way to pass arbitrary options to the server (or our proxy) is
with the "options" keyword, and the options must be percent-encoded. I
think the above would work but i haven't tested it

# Splitting cloud console

Created on 17.06.2022

## Summary

Currently we have `cloud` repository that contains code implementing public API for our clients as well as code for managing storage and internal infrastructure services. We can split everything user-related from everything storage-related to make it easier to test and maintain.

This RFC proposes to introduce a new control-plane service with HTTP API. The overall architecture will look like this:

```markup

Notes:

- diagram is simplified in the less-important places
- directed arrows are strict and mean that connections in the reverse direction are forbidden

This split is quite complex and this RFC proposes several smaller steps to achieve the larger goal: 

1. Start by refactoring the console code, the goal is to have console and control-plane code in the different directories without dependencies on each other.
2. Do similar refactoring for tables in the console database, remove queries selecting data from both console and control-plane; move control-plane tables to a separate database.
3. Implement control-plane HTTP API serving on a separate TCP port; make all console→control-plane calls to go through that HTTP API.
4. Move control-plane source code to the neon repo; start control-plane as a separate service.

## Motivation

These are the two most important problems we want to solve:

- Publish open-source implementation of all our cloud/storage features
- Make a unified control-plane that is used in all cloud (serverless) and local (tests) setups

Right now we have some closed-source code in the cloud repo. That code contains implementation for running Neon computes in k8s and without that code it’s impossible to automatically scale PostgreSQL computes. That means that we don’t have an open-source serverless PostgreSQL at the moment.

After splitting and open-sourcing control-plane service we will have source code and Docker images for all storage services. That control-plane service should have HTTP API for creating and managing tenants (including all our storage features), while proxy will listen for incoming connections and create computes on-demand.

Improving our test suite is an important task, but requires a lot of prerequisites and may require a separate RFC. Possible implementation of that is described in the section [Next steps](#next-steps).

Another piece of motivation can be a better involvement of storage development team into a control-plane. By splitting control-plane from the console, it can be more convenient to test and develop control-plane with paying less attention to “business” features, such as user management, billing and analytics.

For example, console currently requires authentication providers such as GitHub OAuth to work at all, as well as nodejs to be able to build it locally. It will be more convenient to build and run it locally without these requirements.

## Proposed implementation

### Current state of things

Let’s start with defining the current state of things at the moment of this proposal. We have three repositories containing source code:

- open-source `postgres` — our fork of postgres
- open-source `neon` — our main repository for storage source code
- closed-source `cloud` — mostly console backend and UI frontend

This proposal aims not to change anything at the existing code in `neon` and `postgres` repositories, but to create control-plane service and move it’s source code from `cloud` to the `neon` repository. That means that we need to split code in `cloud` repo only, and will consider only this repository for exploring its source code.

Let’s look at the miscellaneous things in the `cloud` repo which are NOT part of the console application, i.e. NOT the Go source code that is compiled to the `./console` binary. There we have:

- command-line tools, such as cloudbench, neonadmin
- markdown documentation
- cloud operations scripts (helm, terraform, ansible)
- configs and other things
- e2e python tests
- incidents playbooks
- UI frontend
- Make build scripts, code generation scripts
- database migrations
- swagger definitions

And also let’s take a look at what we have in the console source code, which is the service we’d like to split:

- API Servers
    - Public API v2
    - Management API v2
    - Public API v1
    - Admin API v1 (same port as Public API v1)
    - Management API v1
- Workers
    - Monitor Compute Activity
    - Watch Failed Operations
    - Availability Checker
    - Business Metrics Collector
- Internal Services
    - Auth Middleware, UserIsAdmin, Cookies
    - Cable Websocket Server
    - Admin Services
        - Global Settings, Operations, Pageservers, Platforms, Projects, Safekeepers, Users
    - Authenticate Proxy
    - API Keys
    - App Controller, serving UI HTML
    - Auth Controller
    - Branches
    - Projects
    - Psql Connect + Passwordless login
    - Users
    - Cloud Metrics
    - User Metrics
    - Invites
    - Pageserver/Safekeeper management
    - Operations, k8s/docker/common logic
    - Platforms, Regions
    - Project State
    - Projects Roles, SCRAM
    - Global Settings
- Other things
    - segment analytics integration
    - sentry integration
    - other common utilities packages

### Drawing the splitting line

The most challenging and the most important thing is to define the line that will split new control-plane service from the existing cloud service. If we don’t get it right, then we can end up with having a lot more issues without many benefits.

We propose to define that line as follows:

- everything user-related stays in the console service
- everything storage-related should be in the control-plane service
- something that falls in between should be decided where to go, but most likely should stay in the console service
- some similar parts should be in both services, such as admin/management/db_migrations

We call user-related all requests that can be connected to some user. The general idea is don’t have any user_id in the control-plane service and operate exclusively on tenant_id+timeline_id, the same way as existing storage services work now (compute, safekeeper, pageserver).

Storage-related things can be defined as doing any of the following:

- using k8s API
- doing requests to any of the storage services (proxy, compute, safekeeper, pageserver, etc..)
- tracking current status of tenants/timelines, managing lifetime of computes

Based on that idea, we can say that new control-plane service should have the following components:

- single HTTP API for everything
    - Create and manage tenants and timelines
    - Manage global settings and storage configuration (regions, platforms, safekeepers, pageservers)
    - Admin API for storage health inspection and debugging
- Workers
    - Monitor Compute Activity
    - Watch Failed Operations
    - Availability Checker
- Internal Services
    - Admin Services
        - Global Settings, Operations, Pageservers, Platforms, Tenants, Safekeepers
    - Authenticate Proxy
    - Branches
    - Psql Connect
    - Cloud Metrics
    - Pageserver/Safekeeper management
    - Operations, k8s/docker/common logic
    - Platforms, Regions
    - Tenant State
    - Compute Roles, SCRAM
    - Global Settings

---

And other components should probably stay in the console service:

- API Servers (no changes here)
    - Public API v2
    - Management API v2
    - Public API v1
    - Admin API v1 (same port as Public API v1)
    - Management API v1
- Workers
    - Business Metrics Collector
- Internal Services
    - Auth Middleware, UserIsAdmin, Cookies
    - Cable Websocket Server
    - Admin Services
        - Users admin stays the same
        - Other admin services can redirect requests to the control-plane
    - API Keys
    - App Controller, serving UI HTML
    - Auth Controller
    - Projects
    - User Metrics
    - Invites
    - Users
    - Passwordless login
- Other things
    - segment analytics integration
    - sentry integration
    - other common utilities packages

There are also miscellaneous things that are useful for all kinds of services. So we can say that these things can be in both services:

- markdown documentation
- e2e python tests
- make build scripts, code generation scripts
- database migrations
- swagger definitions

The single entrypoint to the storage should be control-plane API. After we define that API, we can have code-generated implementation for the client and for the server. The general idea is to move code implementing storage components from the console to the API implementation inside the new control-plane service.

After the code is moved to the new service, we can fill the created void by making API calls to the new service:

- authorization of the client
- mapping user_id + project_id to the tenant_id
- calling the control-plane API

### control-plane API

Currently we have the following projects API in the console:

```
GET /projects/{project_id}
PATCH /projects/{project_id}
POST /projects/{project_id}/branches
GET /projects/{project_id}/databases
POST /projects/{project_id}/databases
GET /projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}
PUT /projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}
POST /projects/{project_id}/delete
GET /projects/{project_id}/issue_token
GET /projects/{project_id}/operations
GET /projects/{project_id}/operations/{operation_id}
POST /projects/{project_id}/query
GET /projects/{project_id}/roles
POST /projects/{project_id}/roles
GET /projects/{project_id}/roles/{role_name}
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/roles/{role_name}
POST /projects/{project_id}/roles/{role_name}/reset_password
POST /projects/{project_id}/start
POST /projects/{project_id}/stop
POST /psql_session/{psql_session_id}
```

It looks fine and we probably already have clients relying on it. So we should not change it, at least for now. But most of these endpoints (if not all) are related to storage, and it can suggest us what control-plane API should look like:

```
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}
PATCH /tenants/{tenant_id}
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/branches
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/databases
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/databases
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/databases/{database_id}
PUT /tenants/{tenant_id}/databases/{database_id}
DELETE /tenants/{tenant_id}/databases/{database_id}
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/delete
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/issue_token
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/operations
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/operations/{operation_id}
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/query
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/roles
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/roles
GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/roles/{role_name}
DELETE /tenants/{tenant_id}/roles/{role_name}
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/roles/{role_name}/reset_password
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/start
POST /tenants/{tenant_id}/stop
POST /psql_session/{psql_session_id}
```

One of the options here is to use gRPC instead of the HTTP, which has some useful features, but there are some strong points towards using plain HTTP:

- HTTP API is easier to use for the clients
- we already have HTTP API in pageserver/safekeeper/console
- we probably want control-plane API to be similar to the console API, available in the cloud

### Getting updates from the storage

There can be some valid cases, when we would like to know what is changed in the storage. For example, console might want to know when user has queried and started compute and when compute was scaled to zero after that, to know how much user should pay for the service. Another example is to get info about reaching the disk space limits. Yet another example is to do analytics, such as how many users had at least one active project in a month.

All of the above cases can happen without using the console, just by accessing compute through the proxy.

To solve this, we can have a log of events occurring in the storage (event logs). That is very similar to operations table we have right now, the only difference is that events are immutable and we cannot change them after saving to the database. For example, we might want to have events for the following activities:

- We finished processing some HTTP API query, such as resetting the password
- We changed some state, such as started or stopped a compute
- Operation is created
- Operation is started for the first time
- Operation is failed for the first time
- Operation is finished

Once we save these events to the database, we can create HTTP API to subscribe to these events. That API can look like this:

```
GET /events/<cursor>

{
  "events": [...],
  "next_cursor": 123
}
```

It should be possible to replay event logs from some point of time, to get a state of almost anything from the storage services. That means that if we maintain some state in the control-plane database and we have a reason to have the same state in the console database, it is possible by polling events from the control-plane API and changing the state in the console database according to the events.

### Next steps

After implementing control-plane HTTP API and starting control-plane as a separate service, we might want to think of exploiting benefits of the new architecture, such as reorganizing test infrastructure. Possible options are listed in the  [Next steps](#next-steps-1).

## Non Goals

RFC doesn’t cover the actual cloud deployment scripts and schemas, such as terraform, ansible, k8s yaml’s and so on.

## Impacted components

Mostly console, but can also affect some storage service.

## Scalability

We should support starting several instances of the new control-plane service at the same time.

At the same time, it should be possible to use only single instance of control-plane, which can be useful for local tests.

## Security implications

New control-plane service is an internal service, so no external requests can reach it. But at the same time, it contains API to do absolutely anything with any of the tenants. That means that bad internal actor can potentially read and write all of the tenants. To make this safer, we can have one of these:

- Simple option is to protect all requests with a single private key, so that no one can make requests without having that one key.
- Another option is to have a separate token for every tenant and store these tokens in another secure place. This way it’s harder to access all tenants at once, because they have the different tokens.

## Alternative implementation

There was an idea to create a k8s operator for managing storage services and computes, but author of this RFC is not really familiar with it.

Regarding less alternative ideas, there are another options for the name of the new control-plane service:

- storage-ctl
- cloud
- cloud-ctl

## Pros/cons of proposed approaches (TODO)

Pros:

- All storage features are completely open-source
- Better tests coverage, less difference between cloud and local setups
- Easier to develop storage and cloud features, because there is no need to setup console for that
- Easier to deploy storage-only services to the any cloud

Cons:

- All storage features are completely open-source
- Distributed services mean more code to connect different services and potential network issues
- Console needs to have a dependency on storage API, there can be complications with developing new feature in a branch
- More code to JOIN data from different services (console and control-plane)

## Definition of Done

We have a new control-plane service running in the k8s. Source code for that control-plane service is located in the open-source neon repo.

## Next steps

After we’ve reached DoD, we can make further improvements.

First thing that can benefit from the split is local testing. The same control-plane service can implement starting computes as a local processes instead of k8s deployments. If it will also support starting pageservers/safekeepers/proxy for the local setup, then it can completely replace `./neon_local` binary, which is currently used for testing. The local testing environment can look like this:

```

The key thing here is that control-plane local service have the same API and almost the same implementation as the one deployed in the k8s. This allows to run the same e2e tests against both cloud and local setups.

For the python test_runner tests everything can stay mostly the same. To do that, we just need to replace `./neon_local` cli commands with API calls to the control-plane.

The benefit here will be in having fast local tests that are really close to our cloud setup. Bugs in k8s queries are still cannot be found when running computes as a local processes, but it should be really easy to start k8s locally (for example in k3s) and run the same tests with control-plane connected to the local k8s.

Talking about console and UI tests, after the split there should be a way to test these without spinning up all the storage locally. New control-plane service has a well-defined API, allowing us to mock it. This way we can create UI tests to verify the right calls are issued after specific UI interactions and verify that we render correct messages when API returns errors.

# Name

Tenant and timeline data management in pageserver

## Summary

This RFC attempts to describe timeline-related data management as it's done now in pageserver, highlight current complexities caused by this and propose a set of changes to mitigate them.

The main goal is to prepare for future [on-demand layer downloads](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/2029), yet timeline data is one of the core primitive of pageserver, so a number of other RFCs are affected either.
Due to that, this document won't have a single implementation, rather requiring a set of code changes to achieve the final state.

RFC considers the repository at the `main` branch, commit [`28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/tree/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d) on the time of writing.

## Motivation

In recent discussions, it became more clear that timeline-related code becomes harder to change: it consists of multiple disjoint modules, each requiring a synchronization to access.
The lower the code is, the complex the sync gets since many concurrent processes are involved and require orchestration to keep the data consistent.
As the number of modules and isolated data grows per timeline, more questions and corner cases arise:

- https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1559
  right now it's not straightened out what to do when the synchronization task fails for too many times: every separate module's data has to be treated differently.

- https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1751
  GC and compaction file activities are not well known outside their tasks code, causing race bugs

- https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/2003
  Even the tenant management gets affected: we have to alter its state based on timeline state, yet the data for making the decision is separated and the synchronisation logic has bugs

- more issues were brought in discussions, but apparently they were too specific to the code to mention them in the issues.
  For instance, `tenant_mgr` itself is a static object that we can not mock anyhow, which reduces our capabilities to test the data synchronization logic.
  In fact, we have zero Rust tests that cover the case of synchronizing more than one module's data.

On demand layer downloads would require us to dynamically manage the layer files, which we almost not doing at all on the module level, resulting in the most of their APIs dealing with timelines, rather than the layer files.
The disjoint data that would require data synchronization with possibly a chain of lock acquisitions, some async and some sync, and it would be hard to unit test it with the current code state.

Neither this helps to easy start the on-demand download epic, nor it's easy to add more timeline-related code on top, whatever the task is.
We have to develop a vision on a number of topics before progressing safely:

- timeline and tenant data structure and how should we access it
- sync and async worlds and in what way that should evolve
- unit tests for the complex logic

This RFC aims to provide a general overview of the existing situation and propose ways to improve it.
The changes proposed are quite big and no single PR is expected to do the adjustments, they should gradually be done during the on-demand download work later.

## What is a timeline and its data

First, we need to define what data we want to manage per timeline.
Currently, the data every timeline operates is:

- a set of layer files, on the FS

  Never updated files, created after pageserver's checkpoints and compaction runs, can be removed from the local FS due to compaction, gc or timeline deletion.

- a set of layer files, on the remote storage

  Identically named and placed in tenant subdirectories files on the remote storage (S3), copied by a special background sync thread

- a `metadata` file, on the FS

  Updated after every checkpoint with the never `disk_consistent_lsn` and `latest_gc_cutoff_lsn` values. Used to quickly restore timeline's basic metadata on pageserver restart.
  Also contains data about the ancestor, if the timeline was branched off another timeline.

- an `index_part.json` file, on the remote storage

  Contains `metadata` file contents and a list of layer files, available in the current S3 "directory" for the timeline.
  Used to avoid potentially slow and expensive `S3 list` command, updated by the remotes storage sync thread after every operation with the remote layer files.

- LayerMap and PageCache, in memory

  Dynamic, used to store and retrieve the page data to users.

- timeline info, in memory

  LSNs, walreceiver data, `RemoteTimelineIndex` and other data to share via HTTP API and internal processes.

- metrics data, in memory

  Data to push or provide to Prometheus, Opentelemetry, etc.

Besides the data, every timeline currently needs an etcd connection to receive WAL events and connect to safekeepers.

Timeline could be an ancestor to another one, forming a dependency tree, which is implicit right now: every time relations are looked up in place, based on the corresponding `TimelineMetadata` struct contents.
Yet, there's knowledge on a tenant as a group of timelines, belonging to a single user which is used in GC and compaction tasks, run on every tenant.
`tenant_mgr` manages tenant creation and its task startup, along with the remote storage sync for timeline layers.

Last file being managed per-tenant is the tenant config file, created and updated on the local FS to hold tenant-specific configuration between restarts.
It's not yet anyhow synchronized with the remote storage, so only exists on the local FS.

### How the data is stored

We have multiple places where timeline data is stored:

- `tenant_mgr` [holds](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/tenant_mgr.rs#L43) a static `static ref TENANTS: RwLock<HashMap<ZTenantId, Tenant>>` with the `Tenant` having the `local_timelines: HashMap<ZTimelineId, Arc<DatadirTimelineImpl>>` inside

- same `Tenant` above has actually two references to timelines: another via its `repo: Arc<RepositoryImpl>` with `pub type RepositoryImpl = LayeredRepository;` that [holds](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/layered_repository.rs#L178) `Mutex<HashMap<ZTimelineId, LayeredTimelineEntry>>`

- `RemoteTimelineIndex` [contains](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/storage_sync/index.rs#L84) the metadata about timelines on the remote storage (S3) for sync reasons and possible HTTP API queries

- `walreceiver` [stores](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/walreceiver.rs#L60) the metadata for possible HTTP API queries and its [internal state](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/walreceiver/connection_manager.rs#L245) with a reference to the timeline, its current connections and etcd subscription (if any)

- `PageCache` contains timeline-related data, and is created globally for the whole pageserver

- implicitly, we also have files on local FS, that contain timeline state. We operate on those files and for some operations (GC, compaction) yet we don't anyhow synchronize the access to the files per se: there are more high-level locks, ensuring only one of a group of operations is running at a time.

  On practice though, `LayerMap` and layer files are tightly coupled together: current low-level code requires a timeline to be loaded into the memory to work with it, and the code removes the layer files after removing the entry from the `LayerMap` first.

Based on this, a high-level pageserver's module diagram with data and entities could be:

![timeline tenant state diagram](./images/017-timeline-data-management/timeline_tenant_state.svg)

A few comments on the diagram:

- the diagram does not show all the data and replaces a few newtypes and type aliases (for example, completely ignores "unloaded" timelines due to reasons described below)

  It aims to show main data and means of synchronizing it.

- modules tend to isolate their data inside and provide access to it via API

Due to multitenancy, that results in a common pattern for storing both tenant and timeline data: `RwLock` or `Mutex` around the `HashMap<Id, Data>`, gc and compaction tasks also use the same lock pattern to ensure no concurrent runs are happening.

- part of the modules is asynchronous, while the other is not, that complicates the data access

Currently, anything that's not related to tasks (walreceiver, storage sync, GC, compaction) is blocking.

Async tasks that try to access the data in the sync world, have to call `std::sync::Mutex::lock` method, which blocks the thread the callee async task runs on, also blocking other async tasks running in the same thread. Methods of `std::sync::RwLock` have the same issues, forcing async tasks either to block or spawn another, "blocking" task on a separate thread.

Sync tasks that try to access the data in the async world, cannot use `.await` hence have to have some `Runtime` doing those calls for them. [`tokio::sync::Mutex`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.19.2/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html#method.blocking_lock) and [`tokio::sync::RwLock`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.19.2/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html#method.blocking_read) provide an API to simplify such calls. Similarly, both `std::sync` and `tokio::sync` have channels that are able to communicate into one direction without blocking and requiring `.await` calls, hence can be used to connect both worlds without locking.

Some modules are in transition, started as async "blocking" tasks and being fully synchronous in their entire code below the start. Current idea is to transfer them to the async further, but it's not yet done.

- locks are used in two different ways:

  - `RwLock<HashMap<..>>` ones to hold the shared data and ensure its atomic updates
  - `Mutex<()>` for synchronizing the tasks, used to implicitly order the data access

  The "shared data" locks of the first kind are mainly accessed briefly to either look up or alter the data, yet there are a few notable exceptions, such as
  `latest_gc_cutoff_lsn: RwLock<Lsn>` that is explicitly held in a few places to prevent GC thread from progressing. Those are covered later in the data access diagrams.

- some synchronizations are not yet implemented

E.g. asynchronous storage sync module does not synchronize with almost synchronous GC and compaction tasks when the layer files are uploaded to the remote storage.
That occasionally results in the files being deleted before the storage upload task is run for this layer, but due to the incremental nature of the layer files, we can handle such situations without issues.

- `LayeredRepository` covers lots of responsibilities: GC and compaction task synchronisation, timeline access (`local_timelines` in `Tenant` is not used directly before the timeline from the repository is accessed), layer flushing to FS, layer sync to remote storage scheduling, etc.

### How is this data accessed?

There are multiple ways the data is accessed, from different sources:

1. [HTTP requests](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/http/routes.rs)

High-level CRUD API for managing tenants, timelines and getting data about them.
Current API list (modified for readability):

```rust
.get("/v1/status", status_handler) // pageserver status
.get("/v1/tenant", tenant_list_handler)
.post("/v1/tenant", tenant_create_handler) // can create "empty" timelines or branch off the existing ones
.get("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id", tenant_status) // the only tenant public metadata
.put("/v1/tenant/config", tenant_config_handler) // tenant config data and local file manager
.get("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline", timeline_list_handler)
.post("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline", timeline_create_handler)
.post("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/attach", tenant_attach_handler) // download entire tenant from the remote storage and load its timelines memory
.post("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/detach", tenant_detach_handler) // delete all tenant timelines from memory, remote corresponding storage and local FS files
.get("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id", timeline_detail_handler)
.delete("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id", timeline_delete_handler)
.get("/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id/wal_receiver", wal_receiver_get_handler) // get walreceiver stats metadata
```

Overall, neither HTTP operation goes below `LayeredRepository` level and does not interact with layers: instead, they manage tenant and timeline entities, their configuration and metadata.

`GET` data is small (relative to layer files contents), updated via brief `.write()/.lock()` calls and read via copying/cloning the data to release the lock soon.
It does not mean that the operations themselves are short, e.g. `tenant_attach_handler` downloads multiple files from the remote storage which might take time, yet the final data is inserted in memory via one brief write under the lock.

Non-`GET` operations mostly follow the same rule, with two differences:

- `tenant_detach_handler` has to wait for its background tasks to stop before shutting down, which requires more work with locks
- `timeline_create_handler` currently requires GC to be paused before branching the timeline, which requires orchestrating too.
  This is the only HTTP operation, able to load the timeline into memory: rest of the operations are reading the metadata or, as in `tenant_attach_handler`, schedule a deferred task to download timeline and load it into memory.

"Timeline data synchronization" section below describes both complex cases in more details.

2. [libpq requests](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/page_service.rs)

Is the main interface of pageserver, intended to handle libpq (and similar) requests.
Operates on `LayeredTimeline` and, lower, `LayerMap` modules; all timelines accessed during the operation are loaded into memory immediately (if not loaded already), operations bail on timeline load errors.

- `pagestream`

  Page requests: `get_rel_exists`, `get_rel_size`, `get_page_at_lsn`, `get_db_size`

  Main API points, intended to be used by `compute` to show the data to the user. All require requests to be made at certain Lsn, if this Lsn is not available in the memory, request processing is paused until that happens or bails after a timeout.

- `basebackup` and `fullbackup`

  Options to generate postgres-compatible backup archives.

- `import basebackup`

- `import wal`

  Import the `pg_wal` section of the basebackup archive.

- `get_last_record_rlsn`, `get_lsn_by_timestamp`

"Metadata" retrieval methods, that still requires internal knowledge about layers.

- `set`, `fallpoints`, `show`

Utility methods to support various edge cases or help with debugging/testing.

- `do_gc`, `compact`, `checkpoint`

Manual triggers for corresponding tenant tasks (GC, compaction) and inmemory layer flushing on disk (checkpointing), with upload task scheduling as a follow-up.

Apart from loading into memory, every timeline layer has to be accessed using specific set of locking primitives, especially if a write operations happens: otherwise, GC or compaction might spoil the data. User API is implicitly affected by this synchronization during branching, when a GC has to be orchestrated properly before the new timeline could be branched off the existing one.
See "Timeline data synchronization" section for the united synchronization diagram on the topic.

3. internal access

Entities within pageserver that update files on local FS and remote storage, metadata in memory; has to use internal data for those operations.
Places that access internal, lower data are also required to have the corresponding timeline successfully loaded into memory and accessed with corresponding synchronization.

If ancestors' data is accessed via its child branch, it means more than one timeline has to be loaded into memory entirely and more locking primitives usage involved.
Right now, all ancestors are resolved in-place: every place that has to check timeline's ancestor has to lock the timelines map, check if one is loaded into the memory, load it there or bail if it's not present, and get the information required and so on.

- periodic GC and compaction tasks

Alter metadata (GC info), in-memory data (layer relations, page caches, etc.) and layer files on disk.
Same as its libpq counterparts, needs full synchronization with the low level layer management code.

- storage sync task

Alters metadata (`RemoteTimelineIndex`), layer files on remote storage (upload, delete) and local FS (download) and in-memory data (registers downloaded timelines in the repository).
Currently, does not know anything about layer files contents, rather focusing on the file structure and metadata file updates: due to the fact that the layer files cannot be updated (only created or deleted), storage sync is able to back up the files to the remote storage without further low-level synchronizations: only when the timeline is downloaded, a load operation is needed to run, possibly pausing GC and compaction tasks.

- walreceiver and walingest task

Per timeline, subscribes for etcd events from safekeeper and eventually spawns a walreceiver connection task to receive WAL from a safekeeper node.
Fills memory with data, eventually triggering a checkpoint task that creates a new layer file in the local FS and schedules a remote storage sync upload task.
During WAL receiving, also updates a separate in-memory data structure with the walreceiver stats, used later via HTTP API.

Layer updates require low-level set of sync primitives used to preserve the data consistency.

- checkpoint (layer freeze) task

Periodic, short-lived tasks to generate a new layer file in the FS. Requires low level synchronization in the end, when the layer is being registered after creating and has additional mode to ensure only one concurrent compaction happens at a time.

### Timeline data synchronization

Here's a high-level timeline data access diagram, considering the synchronization locks, based on the state diagram above.

For brevity, diagrams do not show `RwLock<HashMap<..>>` data accesses, considering them almost instant to happen.
`RwLock<LayerMap>` is close to be an exception to the previous rule, since it's taken in a multiple places to ensure all layers are inserted correctly.
Yet the only long operation in the current code is a `.write()` lock on the map during its creation, while all other lock usages tend to be short in the current code.
Note though, that due to current "working with loaded timeline only", prevailing amount of the locks taken on the struct are `.write()` locks, not the `.read()` ones.
To simplify the diagrams, these accesses are now considered "fast" data access, not the synchronization attempts.

`write_lock` synchronization diagram:

![timeline data access synchronization(1)](./images/017-timeline-data-management/timeline_data_access_sync_1.svg)

Comments:

- `write_lock: Mutex<()>` ensures that all timeline data being written into **in-memory layers** is done without races, one concurrent write at a time
- `layer_flush_lock: Mutex<()>` and layer flushing seems to be slightly bloated with various ways to create a layer on disk and write it in memory
  The lock itself seem to repeat `write_lock` purpose when it touches in-memory layers, and also to limit the on-disk layer creations.
  Yet the latter is not really done consistently, since remote storage sync manages to download and register the new layers without touching the locks
- `freeze_inmem_layer(true)` that touches both `write_lock` and `layer_flush_lock` seems not very aligned with the rest of the locks to those primitives; it also now restricts the layer creation concurrency even more, yet there are various `freeze_inmem_layer(false)` that are ignoring those restrictions at the same time

![timeline data access synchronization(2)](./images/017-timeline-data-management/timeline_data_access_sync_2.svg)

Comments:

- `partitioning: Mutex<(KeyPartitioning, Lsn)>` lock is a data sync lock that's not used to synchronize the tasks (all other such kinds were considered "almost instant" and omitted on the diagram), yet is very similar to what `write_lock` and `layer_flush_lock` do: it ensures the timeline in-memory data is up-to-date with the layer files state on disk, which is what `LayerMap` is for.

- there are multiple locks that do similar task management operations:
  - `gc_cs: Mutex<()>` and `latest_gc_cutoff_lsn: RwLock<Lsn>` ensures that branching and gc are not run concurrently
  - `layer_removal_cs: Mutex<()>` lock ensure gc, compaction and timeline deletion via HTTP API do not run concurrently
  - `file_lock: RwLock<()>` is used as a semaphore, to ensure "all" gc and compaction tasks are shut down and do not start
    Yet that lock does take only gc and compaction from internal loops: libpq call is not cancelled and waited upon.

Those operations do not seem to belong to a timeline. Moreover, some of those could be eliminated entirely due to duplication of their tasks.

## Proposed implementation

### How to structure timeline data access better

- adjust tenant state handling

Current [`TenantState`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/tenant_mgr.rs#L108) [changes](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/tenant_mgr.rs#L317) mainly indicates whether GC and compaction tasks are running or not; another state, `Broken` shows only in case any timeline does not load during startup.

We could start both GC and compaction tasks at the time the tenant is created and adjust the tasks to throttle/sleep on timeline absence and wake up when the first one is added.
The latter becomes more important on download on demand, since we won't have the entire timeline in reach to verify its correctness. Moreover, if any network connection happens, the timeline could fail temporarily and entire tenant should be marked as broken due to that.

Since nothing verifies the `TenantState` via HTTP API currently, it makes sense to remove the whole state entirely and don't write the code to synchronize its changes.
Instead, we could indicate internal issues for every timeline and have a better API to "stop" timeline processing without deleting its data, making our API less restrictive.

- remove the "unloaded" status for the timeline

Current approach to timeline management [assumes](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/layered_repository.rs#L486-L493)

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum LayeredTimelineEntry {
    Loaded(Arc<LayeredTimeline>),
    Unloaded {
        id: ZTimelineId,
        metadata: TimelineMetadata,
    },
}
```

supposes that timelines have to be in `Unloaded` state.

The difference between both variants is whether its layer map was loaded from disk and kept in memory (Loaded) or not (Unloaded).
The idea behind such separation was to lazy load timelines in memory with all their layers only after its first access and potentially unload them later.

Yet now there's no public API methods, that deal with unloaded timelines' layers: all of them either bail when such timeline is worked on, or load it into memory and continue working.
Moreover, every timeline in the local FS is loaded on pageserver startup now, so only two places where `Unloaded` variant is used are branching and timeline attach, with both loading the timeline into memory before the end of the operation.
Even if that loading into memory bails for some reason, next GC or compaction task periodic run would load such timeline into memory.
There are a few timeline methods that return timeline metadata without loading its layers, but such metadata also comes from the `metadata` FS file, not the layer files (so no page info could be retrieved without loading the entire layer map first).

With the layer on-demand download, it's not feasible anymore to wait for the entire layer map to be loaded into the memory, since it might not even be available on the local FS when requested: `LayerMap` needs to be changed to contain metadata to retrieve the missing layers and handle partially present on the local FS timeline state.

To accommodate to that and move away from the redundant status, a timeline should always be "loaded" with its metadata read from the disk and its layer map prepared to be downloaded when requested, per layer.

Layers in the layer map, on the other hand, could be in various state: loaded, unloaded, downloading, downloading failed, etc. and their state has to be handled instead, if we want to support on-demand download in the future.

This way, tenants and timelines could always try to serve requests and do their internal tasks periodically, trying to recover.

- scale down the remote storage sync to per layer file, not per timeline as now

Due to the reasons from the previous bullet, current remote storage model needs its timeline download approach to be changed.
Right now, a timeline is marked as "ready" only after all its layers on the remote storage are downloaded on the local storage.
With the on-demand download approach, only remote storage timeline metadata should be downloaded from S3, leaving the rest of the layers ready for download if/when it's requested.

Note: while the remote storage sync should operate per layer, it should stay global for all tenants, to better manage S3 limits and sync queue priorities.
Yet the only place using remote storage should be the layer map.

- encapsulate `tenant_mgr` logic into a regular Rust struct, unite with part of the `Repository` and anything else needed to manage the timeline data in a single place and to test it independently

[`Repository`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/repository.rs#L187) trait gets closer to `tenant_mgr` in terms of functionality: there are two background task-related functions, that are run on all timelines of a tenant: `gc_iteration` (it does allow running on a single timeline, but GC task runs it on all timelines) and `compaction_iteration` that are related to service tasks, not the data storage; and the metadata management functions, also not really related to the timeline contents.

`tenant_mgr` proxies some of the `Repository` calls, yet both service tasks use `tenant_mgr` to access the data they need, creating a circular dependency between their APIs.
To avoid excessive synchronization between components, taking multiple locks for that and static state, we can organize the data access and updates in one place.
One potential benefit Rust gets from this is the ability to track and manage timeline resources, if all the related data is located in one place.

- move `RemoteStorage` usage from `LayeredRepository` into `LayerMap`, as the rest of the layer-based entities (layer files, etc.)

Layer == file in our model, since pageserver always either tries to load the LayerMap from disk for the timeline not in memory, or assumes the file contents matches its memory.
`LayeredRepository` is one of the most loaded objects currently and not everything from it deserves unification with the `tenant_mgr`.
In particular, layer files need to be better prepared for future download on demand functionality, where every layer could be dynamically loaded and unloaded from memory and local FS.
Current amount of locks and sync-async separation would make it hard to implement truly dynamic (un)loading; moreover, we would need retries with backoffs, since the unloaded layer files are most probably not available on the local FS either and network is not always reliable.

One of the solutions to the issue is already being developed for the remote storage sync: [SyncQueue](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/28243d68e60ffc7e69f158522f589f7d2e09186d/pageserver/src/storage_sync.rs#L463)
The queue is able to batch CRUD layer operations (both for local and remote FS contexts) and reorder them to increase the sync speed.
Similar approach could be generalized for all layer modifications, including in-memory ones such as GC or compaction: this way, we could manage all layer modifications and reads in one place with lesser locks and tests that are closer to unit tests.

- change the approach to locking synchronization

A number of locks in the timeline seem to be used to coordinate gc, compaction tasks and related processes.
It should be done in a task manager or other place, external to the timeline.

Timeline contents still needs to be synchronized, considering the task work, so fields like `latest_gc_cutoff_lsn: RwLock<Lsn>` are expected to stay for that purpose, but general amount of locks should be reduced.

### Putting it all together

If the proposal bullets applied to the diagrams above, the state could be represented as:

![timeline timeline tenant state](./images/017-timeline-data-management/proposed_timeline_tenant_state.svg)

The reorders aim to put all tasks into separated modules, with strictly defined interfaces and as less knowledge about other components, as possible.
This way, all timeline data is now in the `data_storage`, including the GC, walreceiver, `RemoteTimelineIndex`, `LayerMap`, etc. with some API to get the data in the way,
more convenient for the data sync system inside.
So far, it seems that a few maps with `Arc<RwLock<SeparateData>>` with actual data operations added inside each `SeparateData` struct, if needed.

`page_cache` is proposed to placed into the same `data_storage` since it contains tenant timelines' data: this way, all metadata and data is in the same struct, simplifying things with Rust's borrow checker and allowing us to share internals between data modules and later might simplify timeline in-memory size tracking.

`task_manager` is related to data storage and manages all tenant and timeline tasks, manages shared resources (runtimes, thread pools, etcd connection, etc.) and synchronizes tasks.
All locks such as `gc_cs` belong to this module tree, as primitives inherently related to the task synchronization.
Tasks have to access timelines and their metadata, but should do that through `data_storage` API and similar.

`task_manager` should (re)start, stop and track all tasks that are run in it, selecting an appropriate runtime depending on a task kind (we have async/sync task separation, CPU and IO bound tasks separation, ...)
Some locks such as `layer_removal_cs` one are not needed, if the only component that starts the tasks ensures they don't run concurrently.

`LayeredTimeline` is still split into two parts, more high-level with whatever primitives needed to sync its state, and the actual state storage with `LayerMap` and other low level entities.
Only `LayerMap` knows what storage it's layer files are taken from (inmem, local FS, etc.), and it's responsible for synchronizing the layers when needed, as also reacting to sync events, successful or not.

Last but not least, `tenant config file` has to be backed into a remote storage, as tenant-specific information for all timelines.
Tenant and timelines have volatile information that's now partially mixed with constant information (e.g. fields in `metadata` file), that model should be better split and handled, in case we want to properly support its backups and synchronization.

![proposed timeline data access synchronization(1)](./images/017-timeline-data-management/proposed_timeline_data_access_sync_1.svg)

There's still a need to keep inmemory layer buffer synchronized during layer freezing, yet that could happen on a layer level, not on a timeline level, as `write_lock` used to be, so we could lower the sync primitives one layer deeper, preparing us for download on demand feature, where multiple layers could be concurrently streamed and written from various data sources.

Flushing the frozen layer requires creating a new layer on disk and further remote storage upload, so `LayerMap` has to get those flushed bytes and queue them later: no need to block in the timeline itself for anything again, rather locking on the layer level, if needed.

![proposed timeline data access synchronization(2)](./images/017-timeline-data-management/proposed_timeline_data_access_sync_2.svg)

Lock diagrams legend:

![lock diagrams legend](./images/017-timeline-data-management/lock_legend.svg)

After the frozen layers are flushed, something has to ensure that the layer structure is intact, so a repartitioning lock is needed still, and could also guard the layer map structure changes, since both are needed either way.
This locking belongs to the `LowLevelLayeredTimeline` from the proposed data structure diagram, as the place with all such data being held.

Similarly, branching is still required to be done after certain Lsn in our current model, but this needs only one lock to synchronize and that could be the `gc_cs: Mutex<()>` lock.
It raises the question of where this lock has to be placed, it's the only place that requires pausing a GC task during external, HTTP request handling.
The right place for the lock seems to be the `task_manager` that could manage GC in more fine-grained way to accommodate the incoming branching request.

There's no explicit lock sync between GC, compaction or other mutually exclusive tasks: it is a job of the `task_manager` to ensure those are not run concurrently.

# Storage messaging

Safekeepers need to communicate to each other to
* Trim WAL on safekeepers;
* Decide on which SK should push WAL to the S3;
* Decide on when to shut down SK<->pageserver connection;
* Understand state of each other to perform peer recovery;

Pageservers need to communicate to safekeepers to decide which SK should provide
WAL to the pageserver.

This is an iteration on [015-storage-messaging](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/main/docs/rfcs/015-storage-messaging.md) describing current situation,
potential performance issue and ways to address it.

## Background

What we have currently is very close to etcd variant described in
015-storage-messaging. Basically, we have single `SkTimelineInfo` message
periodically sent by all safekeepers to etcd for each timeline.
* Safekeepers subscribe to it to learn status of peers (currently they subscribe to
  'everything', but they can and should fetch data only for timelines they hold).
* Pageserver subscribes to it (separate watch per timeline) to learn safekeepers
  positions; based on that, it decides from which safekeepers to pull WAL.

Also, safekeepers use etcd elections API to make sure only single safekeeper
offloads WAL.

It works, and callmemaybe is gone. However, this has a performance
hazard. Currently deployed etcd can do about 6k puts per second (using its own
`benchmark` tool); on my 6 core laptop, while running on tmpfs, this gets to
35k. Making benchmark closer to our usage [etcd watch bench](https://github.com/arssher/etcd-client/blob/watch-bench/examples/watch_bench.rs),
I get ~10k received messages per second with various number of publisher-subscribers
(laptop, tmpfs). Diving this by 12 (3 sks generate msg, 1 ps + 3 sk consume them) we
get about 800 active timelines, if message is sent each second. Not extremely
low, but quite reachable.

A lot of idle watches seem to be ok though -- which is good, as pageserver
subscribes to all its timelines regardless of their activity.

Also, running etcd with fsyncs disabled is messy -- data dir must be wiped on
each restart or there is a risk of corruption errors.

The reason is etcd making much more than what we need; it is a fault tolerant
store with strong consistency, but I claim all we need here is just simplest pub
sub with best effort delivery, because
* We already have centralized source of truth for long running data, like which
  tlis are on which nodes  -- the console.
* Momentary data (safekeeper/pageserver progress) doesn't make sense to persist.
  Instead of putting each change to broker, expecting it to reliably deliver it
  is better to just have constant flow of data for active timelines: 1) they
  serve as natural heartbeats -- if node can't send, we shouldn't pull WAL from
  it 2) it is simpler -- no need to track delivery to/from the broker.
  Moreover, latency here is important: the faster we obtain fresh data, the
  faster we can switch to proper safekeeper after failure.
* As for WAL offloading leader election, it is trivial to achieve through these
  heartbeats -- just take suitable node through deterministic rule (min node
  id).  Once network is stable, this is a converging process (well, except
  complicated failure topology, but even then making it converge is not
  hard). Such elections bear some risk of several offloaders running
  concurrently for a short period of time, but that's harmless.

  Generally, if one needs strong consistency, electing leader per se is not
  enough; it must be accompanied with number (logical clock ts), checked at
  every action to track causality. s3 doesn't provide CAS, so it can't
  differentiate old/new leader, this must be solved differently.

  We could use etcd CAS (its most powerful/useful primitive actually) to issue
  these leader numbers (and e.g. prefix files in s3), but currently I don't see
  need for that.


Obviously best effort pub sub is much more simpler and performant; the one proposed is

## gRPC broker

I took tonic and [prototyped](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/asher/neon-broker/broker/src/broker.rs) the replacement of functionality we currently use
with grpc streams and tokio mpsc channels. The implementation description is at the file header.

It is just 500 lines of code and core functionality is complete. 1-1 pub sub
gives about 120k received messages per second; having multiple subscribers in
different connections quickly scales to 1 million received messages per second.
I had concerns about many concurrent streams in singe connection, but 2^20
subscribers still work (though eat memory, with 10 publishers 20GB are consumed;
in this implementation each publisher holds full copy of all subscribers). There
is `bench.rs` nearby which I used for testing.

`SkTimelineInfo` is wired here, but another message can be added (e.g. if
pageservers want to communicate with each other) with templating.

### Fault tolerance

Since such broker is stateless, we can run it under k8s. Or add proxying to
other members, with best-effort this is simple.

### Security implications

Communication happens in a private network that is not exposed to users;
additionally we can add auth to the broker.

## Alternative: get existing pub-sub

We could take some existing pub sub solution, e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis. But in this
case IMV simplicity of our own outweighs external dependency costs (RabbitMQ is
much more complicated and needs VM; Redis Rust client maintenance is not
ideal...). Also note that projects like CockroachDB and TiDB are based on gRPC
as well.

## Alternative: direct communication

Apart from being transport, broker solves one more task: discovery, i.e. letting
safekeepers and pageservers find each other. We can let safekeepers know, for
each timeline, both other safekeepers for this timeline and pageservers serving
it. In this case direct communication is possible:
 - each safekeeper pushes to each other safekeeper status of timelines residing
   on both of them, letting remove WAL, decide who offloads, decide on peer
   recovery;
 - each safekeeper pushes to each pageserver status of timelines residing on
   both of them, letting pageserver choose from which sk to pull WAL;

It was mostly described in [014-safekeeper-gossip](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/main/docs/rfcs/014-safekeepers-gossip.md), but I want to recap on that.

The main pro is less one dependency: less moving parts, easier to run Neon
locally/manually, less places to monitor. Fault tolerance for broker disappears,
no kuber or something. To me this is a big thing.

Also (though not a big thing) idle watches for inactive timelines disappear:
naturally safekeepers learn about compute connection first and start pushing
status to pageserver(s), notifying it should pull.

Importantly, I think that eventually knowing and persisting peers and
pageservers on safekeepers is inevitable:
- Knowing peer safekeepers for the timeline is required for correct
  automatic membership change -- new member set must be hardened on old
  majority before proceeding. It is required to get rid of sync-safekeepers
  as well (peer recovery up to flush_lsn).
- Knowing pageservers where the timeline is attached is needed to
  1. Understand when to shut down activity on the timeline, i.e. push data to
     the broker. We can have a lot of timelines sleeping quietly which
	 shouldn't occupy resources.
  2. Preserve WAL for these (currently we offload to s3 and take it from there,
     but serving locally is better, and we get one less condition on which WAL
     can be removed from s3).

I suppose this membership data should be passed to safekeepers directly from the
console because
1. Console is the original source of this data, conceptually this is the
   simplest way (rather than passing it through compute or something).
2. We already have similar code for deleting timeline on safekeepers
   (and attaching/detaching timeline on pageserver), this is a typical
   action -- queue operation against storage node and execute it until it
   completes (or timeline is dropped).

Cons of direct communication are
- It is more complicated: each safekeeper should maintain set of peers it talks
  to, and set of timelines for each such peer -- they ought to be multiplexed
  into single connection.
- Totally, we have O(n^2) connections instead of O(n) with broker schema
  (still O(n) on each node). However, these are relatively stable, async and
  thus not very expensive, I don't think this is a big problem. Up to 10k
  storage nodes I doubt connection overhead would be noticeable.

I'd use gRPC for direct communication, and in this sense gRPC based broker is a
step towards it.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/019-tenant-timeline-lifecycles.md:

# Managing Tenant and Timeline lifecycles

## Summary

The pageserver has a Tenant object in memory for each tenant it manages, and a
Timeline for each timeline. There are a lot of tasks that operate on the tenants
and timelines with references to those objects. We have some mechanisms to track
which tasks are operating on each Tenant and Timeline, and to request them to
shutdown when a tenant or timeline is deleted, but it does not cover all uses,
and as a result we have many race conditions around tenant/timeline shutdown.

## Motivation

We have a bunch of race conditions that can produce weird errors and can be hard
to track down.

## Non Goals

This RFC only covers the problem of ensuring that a task/thread isn't operating
on a Tenant or Timeline. It does not cover what states, aside from Active and
non-Active, each Tenant and Timeline should have, or when exactly the transitions
should happen.

## Impacted components (e.g. pageserver, safekeeper, console, etc)

Pageserver. Although I wonder if the safekeeper should have a similar mechanism.

## Current situation

Most pageserver tasks of are managed by task_mgr.rs:

- LibpqEndpointListener
- HttpEndPointListener
- WalReceiverManager and -Connection
- GarbageCollector and Compaction
- InitialLogicalSizeCalculation

In addition to those tasks, the walreceiver performs some direct tokio::spawn
calls to spawn tasks that are not registered with 'task_mgr'. And all of these
tasks can spawn extra operations with tokio spawn_blocking.

Whenever a tenant or timeline is removed from the system, by pageserver
shutdown, delete_timeline or tenant-detach operation, we rely on the task
registry in 'task_mgr.rs' to wait until there are no tasks operating on the
tenant or timeline, before its Tenant/Timeline object is removed. That relies on
each task to register itself with the tenant/timeline ID in
'task_mgr.rs'. However, there are many gaps in that. For example,
GarbageCollection and Compaction tasks are registered with the tenant, but when
they proceed to operate on a particular timeline of the tenant, they don't
register with timeline ID. Because of that, the timeline can be deleted while GC
or compaction is running on it, causing failures in the GC or compaction (see
https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/2442).

Another problem is that the task registry only works for tokio Tasks. There is
no way to register a piece of code that runs inside spawn_blocking(), for
example.

## Proposed implementation

This "voluntary" registration of tasks is fragile. Let's use Rust language features
to enforce that a tenant/timeline cannot be removed from the system when there is
still some code operating on it.

Let's introduce new Guard objects for Tenant and Timeline, and do all actions through
the Guard object. Something like:

TenantActiveGuard: Guard object over Arc<Tenant>. When you acquire the guard,
the code checks that the tenant is in Active state. If it's not, you get an
error. You can change the state of the tenant to Stopping while there are
ActiveTenantGuard objects still on it, to prevent new ActiveTenantGuards from
being acquired, but the Tenant cannot be removed until all the guards are gone.

TenantMaintenanceGuard: Like ActiveTenantGuard, but can be held even when the
tenant is not in Active state. Used for operations like attach/detach. Perhaps
allow only one such guard on a Tenant at a time.

Similarly for Timelines. We don't currently have a "state" on Timeline, but I think
we need at least two states: Active and Stopping. The Stopping state is used at
deletion, to prevent new TimelineActiveGuards from appearing, while you wait for
existing TimelineActiveGuards to die out.

The shutdown-signaling, using shutdown_watcher() and is_shutdown_requested(),
probably also needs changes to deal with the new Guards. The rule is that if you
have a TenantActiveGuard, and the tenant's state changes from Active to
Stopping, the is_shutdown_requested() function should return true, and
shutdown_watcher() future should return.

This signaling doesn't necessarily need to cover all cases. For example, if you
have a block of code in spawn_blocking(), it might be acceptable if
is_shutdown_requested() doesn't return true even though the tenant is in
Stopping state, as long as the code finishes reasonably fast.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md:

# Coordinating access of multiple pageservers to the same s3 data

## Motivation

There are some blind spots around coordinating access of multiple pageservers
to the same s3 data. Currently this is applicable only to tenant relocation
case, but in the future we'll need to solve similar problems for
replica/standby pageservers.

## Impacted components (e.g. pageserver, safekeeper, console, etc)

Pageserver

## The problem

### Relocation

During relocation both pageservers can write to s3. This should be ok for all
data except the `index_part.json`. For index part it causes problems during
compaction/gc because they remove files from index/s3.

Imagine this case:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant PS1
    participant S3
    participant PS2

    PS1->>S3: Uploads L1, L2 <br/> Index contains L1 L2
    PS2->>S3: Attach called, sees L1, L2
    PS1->>S3: Compaction comes <br/> Removes L1, adds L3
    note over S3: Index now L2, L3
    PS2->>S3: Uploads new layer L4 <br/> (added to previous view of the index)
    note over S3: Index now L1, L2, L4
```

At this point it is not possible to restore from index, it contains L2 which
is no longer available in s3 and doesn't contain L3 added by compaction by the
first pageserver. So if any of the pageservers restart initial sync will fail
(or in on-demand world it will fail a bit later during page request from
missing layer)

### Standby pageserver

Another related case is standby pageserver. In this case second pageserver can
be used as a replica to scale reads and serve as a failover target in case
first one fails.

In this mode second pageserver needs to have the same picture of s3 files to
be able to load layers on-demand. To accomplish that second pageserver
cannot run gc/compaction jobs. Instead it needs to receive updates for index
contents. (There is no need to run walreceiver on the second pageserver then).

## Observations

- If both pageservers ingest wal then their layer set diverges, because layer
  file generation is not deterministic
- If one of the pageservers does not ingest wal (and just picks up layer
  updates) then it lags behind and cannot really answer queries in the same
  pace as the primary one
- Can compaction help make layers deterministic? E g we do not upload level
  zero layers and construction of higher levels should be deterministic.
  This way we can guarantee that layer creation by timeout wont mess things up.
  This way one pageserver uploads data and second one can just ingest it.
  But we still need some form of election

## Solutions

### Manual orchestration

One possible solution for relocation case is to orchestrate background jobs
from outside. The oracle who runs migration can turn off background jobs on
PS1 before migration and then run migration -> enable them on PS2. The problem
comes if migration fails. In this case in order to resume background jobs
oracle needs to guarantee that PS2 doesn't run background jobs and if it doesn't
respond then PS1 is stuck unable to run compaction/gc. This cannot be solved
without human ensuring that no upload from PS2 can happen. In order to be able
to resolve this automatically CAS is required on S3 side so pageserver can
avoid overwriting index part if it is no longer the leading one

Note that flag that disables background jobs needs to be persistent, because
otherwise pageserver restart will clean it

### Avoid index_part.json

Index part consists of two parts, list of layers and metadata. List of layers
can be easily obtained by `ListObjects` S3 API method. But what to do with
metadata? Create metadata instance for each checkpoint and add some counter
to the file name?

Back to potentially long s3 ls.

### Coordination based approach

Do it like safekeepers chose leader for WAL upload. Ping each other and decide
based on some heuristics e g smallest node id. During relocation PS1 sends
"resign" ping message so others can start election without waiting for a timeout.

This still leaves metadata question open and non deterministic layers are a
problem as well

### Avoid metadata file

One way to eliminate metadata file is to store it in layer files under some
special key. This may resonate with intention to keep all relation sizes in
some special segment to avoid initial download during size calculation.
Maybe with that we can even store pre calculated value.

As a downside each checkpoint gets 512 bytes larger.

If we entirely avoid metadata file this opens up many approaches

* * *

During discussion it seems that we converged on the approach consisting of:

- index files stored per pageserver in the same timeline directory. With that
  index file name starts to look like: `<pageserver_node_id>_index_part.json`.
  In such set up there are no concurrent overwrites of index file by different
  pageservers.
- For replica pageservers the solution would be for primary to broadcast index
  changes to any followers with an ability to check index files in s3 and
  restore the full state. To properly merge changes with index files we can use
  a counter that is persisted in an index file, is incremented on every change
  to it and passed along with broadcasted change. This way we can determine
  whether we need to apply change to the index state or not.
- Responsibility for running background jobs is assigned externally. Pageserver
  keeps locally persistent flag for each tenant that indicates whether this
  pageserver is considered as primary one or not. TODO what happens if we
  crash and cannot start for some extended period of time? Control plane can
  assign ownership to some other pageserver. Pageserver needs some way to check
  if its still the blessed one. Maybe by explicit request to control plane on
  start.

Requirement for deterministic layer generation was considered overly strict
because of two reasons:

- It can limit possible optimizations e g when pageserver wants to reshuffle
  some data locally and doesn't want to coordinate this
- The deterministic algorithm itself can change so during deployments for some
  time there will be two different version running at the same time which can
  cause non determinism

### External elections

The above case with lost state in this schema with externally managed
leadership is represented like this:

Note that here we keep objects list in the index file.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant PS1
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant S3
    participant PS2

    note over PS1,PS2: PS1 starts up and still a leader
    PS1->>CP: Am I still the leader for Tenant X?
    activate CP
    CP->>PS1: Yes
    deactivate CP
    PS1->>S3: Fetch PS1 index.
    note over PS1: Continue operations, start background jobs
    note over PS1,PS2: PS1 starts up and still and is not a leader anymore
    PS1->>CP: Am I still the leader for Tenant X?
    CP->>PS1: No
    PS1->>PS2: Subscribe to index changes
    PS1->>S3: Fetch PS1 and PS2 indexes
    note over PS1: Combine index file to include layers <br> from both indexes to be able <br> to see newer files from leader (PS2)
    note over PS1: Continue operations, do not start background jobs
```

### Internal elections

To manage leadership internally we can use broker to exchange pings so nodes
can decide on the leader roles. In case multiple pageservers are active leader
is the one with lowest node id.

Operations with internally managed elections:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant PS1
    participant S3

    note over PS1: Starts up
    note over PS1: Subscribes to changes, waits for two ping <br> timeouts to see if there is a leader
    PS1->>S3: Fetch indexes from s3
    alt there is a leader
        note over PS1: do not start background jobs, <br> continue applying index updates
    else there is no leader
        note over PS1: start background jobs, <br> broadcast index changes
    end

    note over PS1,S3: Then the picture is similar to external elections <br> the difference is that follower can become a leader <br> if there are no pings after some timeout new leader gets elected
```

### Eviction

When two pageservers operate on a tenant for extended period of time follower
doesn't perform write operations in s3. When layer is evicted follower relies
on updates from primary to get info about layers it needs to cover range for
evicted layer.

Note that it wont match evicted layer exactly, so layers will overlap and
lookup code needs to correctly handle that.

### Relocation flow

Actions become:

- Attach tenant to new pageserver
- New pageserver becomes follower since previous one is still leading
- New pageserver starts replicating from safekeepers but does not upload layers
- Detach is called on the old one
- New pageserver becomes leader after it realizes that old one disappeared

### Index File

Using `s3 ls` on startup simplifies things, but we still need metadata, so we
need to fetch index files anyway. If they contain list of files we can combine
them and avoid costly `s3 ls`

### Remaining issues

- More than one remote consistent lsn for safekeepers to know

Anything else?

### Proposed solution

To recap. On meeting we converged on approach with external elections but I
think it will be overall harder to manage and will introduce a dependency on
control plane for pageserver. Using separate index files for each pageserver
consisting of log of operations and a metadata snapshot should be enough.

### What we need to get there?

- Change index file structure to contain log of changes instead of just the

- Implement pinging/elections for pageservers


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/021-metering.md:

# Consumption tracking


# Goals

This proposal is made with two mostly but not entirely overlapping goals:

* Collect info that is needed for consumption-based billing
* Cross-check AWS bills


# Metrics

There are six metrics to collect:

* CPU time. Wall clock seconds * the current number of cores. We have a fixed ratio of memory to cores, so the current memory size is the function of the number of cores. Measured per each `endpoint`.

* Traffic. In/out traffic on the proxy. Measured per each `endpoint`.

* Written size. Amount of data we write. That is different from both traffic and storage size, as only during the writing we

  a) occupy some disk bandwidth on safekeepers

  b) necessarily cross AZ boundaries delivering WAL to all safekeepers

  Each timeline/branch has at most one writer, so the data is collected per branch.

* Synthetic storage size. That is what is exposed now with pageserver's `/v1/tenant/{}/size`. Looks like now it is per-tenant. (Side note: can we make it per branch to show as branch physical size in UI?)

* Real storage size. That is the size of the tenant directory on the pageservers disk. Per-tenant.

* S3 storage size. That is the size of the tenant data on S3. Per-tenant.

That info should be enough to build an internal model that predicts AWS price (hence tracking `written data` and `real storage size`). As for the billing model we probably can get away with mentioning only `CPU time`, `synthetic storage size`, and `traffic` consumption.

# Services participating in metrics collection

## Proxy

For actual implementation details check `/docs/consumption_metrics.md`

Proxy is the only place that knows about traffic flow, so it tracks it and reports it with quite a small interval, let's say 1 minute. A small interval is needed here since the proxy is stateless, and any restart will reset accumulated consumption. Also proxy should report deltas since the last report, not an absolute value of the counter. Such kind of events is easier to integrate over a period of time to get the amount of traffic during some time interval.

Example event:

```json
{
"metric": "proxy_io_bytes_per_client",
"type": "incremental",
"start_time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"stop_time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"idempotency_key": "2022-12-28 11:07:19.317310324 UTC-1-4019",
"value": 12345454,
"endpoint_id": "5d07d9ce9237c4cd845ea7918c0afa7d",
}
```

Since we report deltas over some period of time, it makes sense to include `event_start_time`/`event_stop_time` where `event_start_time` is the time of the previous report. That will allow us to identify metering gaps better (e.g., failed send/delivery).

When there is no active connection proxy can avoid reporting anything. Also, deltas are additive, so several console instances serving the same user and endpoint can report traffic without coordination.

## Console

The console knows about start/stop events, so it knows the amount of CPU time allocated to each endpoint. It also knows about operation successes and failures and can avoid billing clients after unsuccessful 'suspend' events. The console doesn't know the current compute size within the allowed limits on the endpoint. So with CPU time, we do the following:

* While we don't yet have the autoscaling console can report `cpu time` as the number of seconds since the last `start_compute` event.

* When we have autoscaling, `autoscaler-agent` can report `cpu time`*`compute_units_count` in the same increments as the proxy reports traffic.

Example event:

```json
{
    "metric": "effective_compute_seconds",
    "type": "increment",
    "endpoint_id": "blazing-warrior-34",
    "event_start_time": ...,
    "event_stop_time": ...,
    "value": 12345454,
}
```

I'd also suggest reporting one value, `cpu time`*`compute_units_count`, instead of two separate fields as it makes event schema simpler (it is possible to treat it the same way as traffic) and preserves additivity.

## Pageserver

For actual implementation details check `/docs/consumption_metrics.md`

Pageserver knows / has access to / can calculate the rest of the metrics:

* Written size -- that is basically `last_received_lsn`,
* Synthetic storage size -- there is a way to calculate it, albeit a costly one,
* Real storage size -- there is a way to calculate it using a layer map or filesystem,
* S3 storage size -- can calculate it by S3 API calls

Some of those metrics are expensive to calculate, so the reporting period here is driven mainly by implementation details. We can set it to, for example, once per hour. Not a big deal since the pageserver is stateful, and all metrics can be reported as an absolute value, not increments. At the same time, a smaller reporting period improves UX, so it would be good to have something more real-time.

`written size` is primarily a safekeeper-related metric, but since it is available on both pageserver and safekeeper, we can avoid reporting anything from the safekeeper.

Example event:

```json
{
"metric": "remote_storage_size",
"type": "absolute",
"time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"idempotency_key": "2022-12-28 11:07:19.317310324 UTC-1-4019",
"value": 12345454,
"tenant_id": "5d07d9ce9237c4cd845ea7918c0afa7d",
"timeline_id": "a03ebb4f5922a1c56ff7485cc8854143",
}
```

# Data collection

## Push vs. pull

We already have pull-based Prometheus metrics, so it is tempting to use them here too. However, in our setup, it is hard to tell when some metric changes. For example, garbage collection will constantly free some disk space over a week, even if the project is down for that week. We could also iterate through all existing tenants/branches/endpoints, but that means some amount of code to do that properly and most likely we will end up with some per-metric hacks in the collector to cut out some of the tenants that are surely not changing that metric.

With the push model, it is easier to publish data only about actively changing metrics -- pageserver knows when it performs s3 offloads, garbage collection and starts/stops consuming data from the safekeeper; proxy knows about connected clients; console / autoscaler-agent knows about active cpu time.

Hence, let's go with a push-based model.

## Common bus vs. proxying through the console

We can implement such push systems in a few ways:

a. Each component pushes its metrics to the "common bus", namely segment, Kafka, or something similar. That approach scales well, but it would be harder to test it locally, will introduce new dependencies, we will have to distribute secrets for that connection to all of the components, etc. We would also have to loop back some of the events and their aggregates to the console, as we want to show some that metrics to the user in real-time.

b. Each component can call HTTP `POST` with its events to the console, and the console can forward it to the segment for later integration with metronome / orb / onebill / etc. With that approach, only the console has to speak with segment. Also since that data passes through the console, the console can save the latest metrics values, so there is no need for constant feedback of that events back from the segment.

# Implementation

Each (proxy|pageserver|autoscaler-agent) sends consumption events to the single endpoint in the console:

```json
POST /usage_events HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

[
{
"metric": "remote_storage_size",
"type": "absolute",
"time": "2022-12-28T11:07:19.317310284Z",
"idempotency_key": "2022-12-28 11:07:19.317310324 UTC-1-4019",
"value": 12345454,
"tenant_id": "5d07d9ce9237c4cd845ea7918c0afa7d",
"timeline_id": "a03ebb4f5922a1c56ff7485cc8854143",
},
...
]
```

![data flow](./images/metering.jpg)

Events could be either:
* `incremental` -- change in consumption since the previous event or service restart. That is `effective_cpu_seconds`, `traffic_in_bytes`, and `traffic_out_bytes`.
* `absolute` -- that is the current value of a metric. All of the size-related metrics are absolute.

Each service can post events at its own pace and bundle together data from different tenants/endpoints.

The console algorithm upon receive of events could be the following:

1. Create and send a segment event with the same content (possibly enriching it with tenant/timeline data for endpoint-based events).
2. Update the latest state of per-tenant and per-endpoint metrics in the database.
3. Check whether any of that metrics is above the allowed threshold and stop the project if necessary.

Since all the data comes in batches, we can do the batch update to reduce the number of queries in the database. Proxy traffic is probably the most frequent metric, so with batching, we will have extra `number_of_proxies` requests to the database each minute. This is most likely fine for now but will generate many dead tuples in the console database. If that is the case, we can change step 2 to the following:

2.1. Check if there $tenant_$metric / $endpoint_$metric key in Redis

2.2. If no stored value is found and the metric is incremental, then fetch the current value from DWH (which keeps aggregated value for all the events) and publish it.

2.3. Publish a new value (absolute metric) or add an increment to the stored value (incremental metric)

## Consumption watchdog

Since all the data goes through the console, we don't have to run any background thread/coroutines to check whether consumption is within the allowed limits. We only change consumption with `POST /usage_events`, so limit checks could be applied in the same handler.

## Extensibility

If we need to add a new metric (e.g. s3 traffic or something else), the console code should, by default, process it and publish segment event, even if the metric name is unknown to the console.

## Naming & schema

Each metric name should end up with units -- now `_seconds` and `_bytes`, and segment event should always have `tenant_id` and `timeline_id`/`endpoint_id` where applicable.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/022-pageserver-delete-from-s3.md:

# Deleting pageserver part of tenants data from s3

Created on 08.03.23

## Motivation

Currently we don't delete pageserver part of the data from s3 when project is deleted. (The same is true for safekeepers, but this outside of the scope of this RFC).

This RFC aims to spin a discussion to come to a robust deletion solution that wont put us in into a corner for features like postponed deletion (when we keep data for user to be able to restore a project if it was deleted by accident)

## Summary

TLDR; There are two options, one based on control plane issuing actual delete requests to s3 and the other one that keeps s3 stuff bound to pageserver. Each one has its pros and cons.

The decision is to stick with pageserver centric approach. For motivation see [Decision](#decision).

## Components

pageserver, control-plane

## Requirements

Deletion should successfully finish (eventually) without leaving dangling files in presense of:

- component restarts
- component outage
- pageserver loss

## Proposed implementation

Before the options are discussed, note that deletion can be quite long process. For deletion from s3 the obvious choice is [DeleteObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjects.html) API call. It allows to batch deletion of up to 1k objects in one API call. So deletion operation linearly depends on number of layer files.

Another design limitation is that there is no cheap `mv` operation available for s3. `mv` from `aws s3 mv` uses `copy(src, dst) + delete(src)`. So `mv`-like operation is not feasible as a building block because it actually amplifies the problem with both duration and resulting cost of the operation.

The case when there are multiple pageservers handling the same tenants is largely out of scope of the RFC. We still consider case with migration from one PS to another, but do not consider case when tenant exists on multiple pageservers for extended period of time. The case with multiple pageservers can be reduced to case with one pageservers by calling detach on all pageservers except the last one, for it actual delete needs to be called.

For simplicity lets look into deleting tenants. Differences in deletion process between tenants and timelines are mentioned in paragraph ["Differences between tenants and timelines"](#differences-between-tenants-and-timelines)

### 1. Pageserver owns deletion machinery

#### The sequence

TLDR; With this approach control plane needs to call delete on a tenant and poll for progress. As much as possible is handled on pageserver. Lets see the sequence.

Happy path:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS as Pageserver
    participant S3

    CP->>PS: Delete tenant
    PS->>S3: Create deleted mark file at <br> /tenant/meta/deleted
    PS->>PS: Create deleted mark file locally
    PS->>CP: Accepted
    PS->>PS: delete local files other than deleted mark
    loop Delete layers for each timeline
        PS->>S3: delete(..)
        CP->>PS: Finished?
        PS->>CP: False
    end
    PS->>S3: Delete mark file
    PS->>PS: Delete local mark file

    loop Poll for status
        CP->>PS: Finished?
        PS->>CP: True or False
    end
```

Why two mark files?
Remote one is needed for cases when pageserver is lost during deletion so other pageserver can learn the deletion from s3 during attach.

Why local mark file is needed?

If we don't have one, we have two choices, delete local data before deleting the remote part or do that after.

If we delete local data before remote then during restart pageserver wont pick up remote tenant at all because nothing is available locally (pageserver looks for remote counterparts of locally available tenants).

If we delete local data after remote then at the end of the sequence when remote mark file is deleted if pageserver restart happens then the state is the same to situation when pageserver just missing data on remote without knowing the fact that this data is intended to be deleted. In this case the current behavior is upload everything local-only to remote.

Thus we need local record of tenant being deleted as well.

##### Handle pageserver crashes

Lets explore sequences with various crash points.

Pageserver crashes before `deleted` mark file is persisted in s3:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS as Pageserver
    participant S3

    CP->>PS: Delete tenant
    note over PS: Crash point 1.
    CP->>PS: Retry delete request

    PS->>S3: Create deleted mark file at <br> /tenant/meta/deleted
    PS->>PS: Create deleted mark file locally

    PS->>CP: Accepted

    PS->>PS: delete local files other than deleted mark

    loop Delete layers for each timeline
        PS->>S3: delete(..)
        CP->>PS: Finished?
        PS->>CP: False
    end
    PS->>S3: Delete mark file
    PS->>PS: Delete local mark file

    CP->>PS: Finished?
    PS->>CP: True
```

Pageserver crashed when deleted mark was about to be persisted in s3, before Control Plane gets a response:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS as Pageserver
    participant S3

    CP->>PS: Delete tenant
    PS->>S3: Create deleted mark file at <br> /tenant/meta/deleted

    note over PS: Crash point 2.
    note over PS: During startup we reconcile <br> with remote and see <br> whether the remote mark exists
    alt Remote mark exists
        PS->>PS: create local mark if its missing
        PS->>PS: delete local files other than deleted mark
        loop Delete layers for each timeline
            PS->>S3: delete(..)
        end

        note over CP: Eventually console should <br> retry delete request

        CP->>PS: Retry delete tenant
        PS->>CP: Not modified
    else Mark is missing
        note over PS: Continue to operate the tenant as if deletion didn't happen

        note over CP: Eventually console should <br> retry delete request

        CP->>PS: Retry delete tenant
        PS->>S3: Create deleted mark file at <br> /tenant/meta/deleted
        PS->>CP: Delete tenant
    end

    PS->>PS: Continue with layer file deletions
    loop Delete layers for each timeline
        PS->>S3: delete(..)
        CP->>PS: Finished?
        PS->>CP: False
    end

    PS->>S3: Delete mark file
    PS->>PS: Delete local mark file

    CP->>PS: Finished?
    PS->>CP: True
```

Similar sequence applies when both local and remote marks were persisted but Control Plane still didn't receive a response.

If pageserver crashes after both mark files were deleted then it will reply to control plane status poll request with 404 which should be treated by control plane as success.

The same applies if pageserver crashes in the end, when remote mark is deleted but before local one gets deleted. In this case on restart pageserver moves forward with deletion of local mark and Control Plane will receive 404.

##### Differences between tenants and timelines

For timeline the sequence is the same with the following differences:

- remote delete mark file can be replaced with a boolean "deleted" flag in index_part.json
- local deletion mark is not needed, because whole tenant is kept locally so situation described in motivation for local mark is impossible

##### Handle pageserver loss

If pageseserver is lost then the deleted tenant should be attached to different pageserver and delete request needs to be retried against new pageserver. Then attach logic is shared with one described for pageserver restarts (local deletion mark wont be available so needs to be created).

##### Restrictions for tenant that is in progress of being deleted

I propose to add another state to tenant/timeline - PendingDelete. This state shouldn't allow executing any operations aside from polling the deletion status.

#### Summary

Pros:

- Storage is not dependent on control plane. Storage can be restarted even if control plane is not working.
- Allows for easier dogfooding, console can use Neon backed database as primary operational data store. If storage depends on control plane and control plane depends on storage we're stuck.
- No need to share inner s3 workings with control plane. Pageserver presents api contract and S3 paths are not part of this contract.
- No need to pass list of alive timelines to attach call. This will be solved by pageserver observing deleted flag. See

Cons:

- Logic is a tricky, needs good testing
- Anything else?

### 2. Control plane owns deletion machinery

In this case the only action performed on pageserver is removal of local files.

Everything else is done by control plane. The steps are as follows:

1. Control plane marks tenant as "delete pending" in its database
2. It lists the s3 for all the files and repeatedly calls delete until nothing is left behind
3. When no files are left marks deletion as completed

In case of restart it selects all tenants marked as "delete pending" and continues the deletion.

For tenants it is simple. For timelines there are caveats.

Assume that the same workflow is used for timelines.

If a tenant gets relocated during timeline deletion the attach call with its current logic will pick up deleted timeline in its half deleted state.

Available options:

- require list of alive timelines to be passed to attach call
- use the same schema with flag in index_part.json (again part of the caveats around pageserver restart applies). In this case nothing stops pageserver from implementing deletion inside if we already have these deletion marks.

With first option the following problem becomes apparent:

Who is the source of truth regarding timeline liveness?

Imagine:
PS1 fails.
PS2 gets assigned the tenant.
New branch gets created
PS1 starts up (is it possible or we just recycle it?)
PS1 is unaware of the new branch. It can either fall back to s3 ls, or ask control plane.

So here comes the dependency of storage on control plane. During restart storage needs to know which timelines are valid for operation. If there is nothing on s3 that can answer that question storage needs to ask control plane.

### Summary

Cons:

- Potential thundering herd-like problem during storage restart (requests to control plane)
- Potential increase in storage startup time (additional request to control plane)
- Storage startup starts to depend on console
- Erroneous attach call can attach tenant in half deleted state

Pros:

- Easier to reason about if you don't have to account for pageserver restarts

### Extra notes

There was a concern that having deletion code in pageserver is a littlebit scary, but we need to have this code somewhere. So to me it is equally scary to have that in whatever place it ends up at.

Delayed deletion can be done with both approaches. As discussed with Anna (@stepashka) this is only relevant for tenants (projects) not for timelines. For first approach detach can be called immediately and deletion can be done later with attach + delete. With second approach control plane needs to start the deletion whenever necessary.

## Decision

After discussion in comments I see that we settled on two options (though a bit different from ones described in rfc). First one is the same - pageserver owns as much as possible. The second option is that pageserver owns markers thing, but actual deletion happens in control plane by repeatedly calling ls + delete.

To my mind the only benefit of the latter approach is possible code reuse between safekeepers and pageservers. Otherwise poking around integrating s3 library into control plane, configuring shared knowledge about paths in s3 - are the downsides. Another downside of relying on control plane is the testing process. Control plane resides in different repository so it is quite hard to test pageserver related changes there. e2e test suite there doesn't support shutting down pageservers, which are separate docker containers there instead of just processes.

With pageserver owning everything we still give the retry logic to control plane but its easier to duplicate if needed compared to sharing inner s3 workings. We will have needed tests for retry logic in neon repo.

So the decision is to proceed with pageserver centric approach.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/023-the-state-of-pageserver-tenant-relocation.md:

# The state of pageserver tenant relocation

Created on 17.03.23

## Motivation

There were previous write ups on the subject. The design of tenant relocation was planned at the time when we had quite different landscape. I e there was no on-demand download/eviction. They were on the horizon but we still planned for cases when they were not available. Some other things have changed. Now safekeepers offload wal to s3 so we're not risking overflowing their disks. Having all of the above, it makes sense to recap and take a look at the options we have now, which adjustments we'd like to make to original process, etc.

Related (in chronological order):

- Tracking issue with initial discussion: [#886](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/886)
- [015. Storage Messaging](015-storage-messaging.md)
- [020. Pageserver S3 Coordination](020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md)

## Summary

The RFC consists of a walkthrough of prior art on tenant relocation and corresponding problems. It describes 3 approaches.

1. Simplistic approach that uses ignore and is the fastest to implement. The main downside is a requirement of short downtime.
2. More complicated approach that avoids even short downtime.
3. Even more complicated approach that will allow multiple pageservers to operate concurrently on the same tenant possibly allowing for HA cluster topologies and horizontal scaling of reads (i e compute talks to multiple pageservers).

The order in which solutions are described is a bit different. We start from 2, then move to possible compromises (aka simplistic approach) and then move to discussing directions for solving HA/Pageserver replica case with 3.

## Components

pageserver, control-plane, safekeepers (a bit)

## Requirements

Relocation procedure should move tenant from one pageserver to another without downtime introduced by storage side. For now restarting compute for applying new configuration is fine.

- component restarts
- component outage
- pageserver loss

## The original proposed implementation

The starting point is this sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS1 as Pageserver 1
    participant PS2 as Pageserver 2
    participant S3

    CP->>PS2: Attach tenant X
    PS2->>S3: Fetch timelines, indexes for them
    PS2->>CP: Accepted
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id in project
    CP->>PS1: Detach
```

Which problems do we have with naive approach?

### Concurrent GC and Compaction

The problem is that they can run on both, PS1 and PS2. Consider this example from [Pageserver S3 Coordination RFC](020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant PS1
    participant S3
    participant PS2

    PS1->>S3: Uploads L1, L2 <br/> Index contains L1 L2
    PS2->>S3: Attach called, sees L1, L2
    PS1->>S3: Compaction comes <br/> Removes L1, adds L3
    note over S3: Index now L2, L3
    PS2->>S3: Uploads new layer L4 <br/> (added to previous view of the index)
    note over S3: Index now L1, L2, L4
```

At this point it is not possible to restore the state from index, it contains L2 which
is no longer available in s3 and doesn't contain L3 added by compaction by the
first pageserver. So if any of the pageservers restart, initial sync will fail
(or in on-demand world it will fail a bit later during page request from
missing layer)

The problem lies in shared index_part.json. Having intersecting layers from append only edits is expected to work, though this is an uncharted territory without tests.

#### Options

There are several options on how to restrict concurrent access to index file.

First and the simplest one is external orchestration. Control plane which runs migration can use special api call on pageserver to stop background processes (gc, compaction), and even possibly all uploads.

So the sequence becomes:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS1 as Pageserver 1
    participant PS2 as Pageserver 2
    participant S3

    CP->>PS1: Pause background jobs, pause uploading new layers.
    CP->>PS2: Attach tenant X.
    PS2->>S3: Fetch timelines, index, start background operations
    PS2->>CP: Accepted
    CP->>CP: Monitor PS2 last record lsn, ensure OK lag
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id in project
    CP->>PS1: Detach
```

The downside of this sequence is the potential rollback process. What if something goes wrong on new pageserver? Can we safely roll back to source pageserver?

There are two questions:

#### How can we detect that something went wrong?

We can run usual availability check (consists of compute startup and an update of one row).
Note that we cant run separate compute for that before touching compute that client runs actual workload on, because we cant have two simultaneous computes running in read-write mode on the same timeline (enforced by safekeepers consensus algorithm). So we can either run some readonly check first (basebackup) and then change pageserver id and run availability check. If it failed we can roll it back to the old one.

#### What can go wrong? And how we can safely roll-back?

In the sequence above during attach we start background processes/uploads. They change state in remote storage so it is possible that after rollback remote state will be different from one that was observed by source pageserver. So if target pageserver goes wild then source pageserver may fail to start with changed remote state.

Proposed option would be to implement a barrier (read-only) mode when pageserver does not update remote state.

So the sequence for happy path becomes this one:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS1 as Pageserver 1
    participant PS2 as Pageserver 2
    participant S3

    CP->>PS1: Pause background jobs, pause uploading new layers.
    CP->>PS2: Attach tenant X in remote readonly mode.
    PS2->>S3: Fetch timelines, index
    PS2->>CP: Accepted
    CP->>CP: Monitor PS2 last record lsn, ensure OK lag
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id in project
    CP->>CP: Run successful availability check
    CP->>PS2: Start uploads, background tasks
    CP->>PS1: Detach
```

With this sequence we restrict any changes to remote storage to one pageserver. So there is no concurrent access at all, not only for index_part.json, but for everything else too. This approach makes it possible to roll back after failure on new pageserver.

The sequence with roll back process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS1 as Pageserver 1
    participant PS2 as Pageserver 2
    participant S3

    CP->>PS1: Pause background jobs, pause uploading new layers.
    CP->>PS2: Attach tenant X in remote readonly mode.
    PS2->>S3: Fetch timelines, index
    PS2->>CP: Accepted
    CP->>CP: Monitor PS2 last record lsn, ensure OK lag
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id in project
    CP->>CP: Availability check Failed
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id back
    CP->>PS1: Resume remote operations
    CP->>PS2: Ignore (instead of detach for investigation purposes)
```

## Concurrent branch creation

Another problem is a possibility of concurrent branch creation calls.

I e during migration create_branch can be called on old pageserver and newly created branch wont be seen on new pageserver. Prior art includes prototyping an approach of trying to mirror such branches, but currently it lost its importance, because now attach is fast because we don't need to download all data, and additionally to the best of my knowledge of control plane internals (cc @ololobus to confirm) operations on one project are executed sequentially, so it is not possible to have such case. So branch create operation will be executed only when relocation is completed. As a safety measure we can forbid branch creation for tenants that are in readonly remote state.

## Simplistic approach

The difference of simplistic approach from one described above is that it calls ignore on source tenant first and then calls attach on target pageserver. Approach above does it in opposite order thus opening a possibility for race conditions we strive to avoid.

The approach largely follows this guide: <https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/Cloud-Ad-hoc-tenant-relocation-f687474f7bfc42269e6214e3acba25c7>

The happy path sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CP as Control Plane
    participant PS1 as Pageserver 1
    participant PS2 as Pageserver 2
    participant SK as Safekeeper
    participant S3

    CP->>CP: Enable maintenance mode
    CP->>PS1: Ignore
    CP->>PS2: Attach
    PS2->>CP: Accepted
    loop Delete layers for each timeline
        CP->>PS2: Get last record lsn
        CP->>SK: Get commit lsn
        CP->>CP: OK? Timed out?
    end
    CP->>CP: Change pageserver id in project
    CP->>CP: Run successful availability check
    CP->>CP: Disable maintenance mode
    CP->>PS1: Detach ignored
```

The sequence contains exactly the same rollback problems as in previous approach described above. They can be resolved the same way.

Most probably we'd like to move forward without this safety measure and implement it on top of this approach to make progress towards the downtime-less one.

## Lease based approach

In order to allow for concurrent operation on the same data on remote storage for multiple pageservers we need to go further than external orchestration.

NOTE: [020. Pageserver S3 Coordination](020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md) discusses one more approach that relies on duplication of index_part.json for each pageserver operating on the timeline. This approach still requires external coordination which makes certain things easier but requires additional bookkeeping to account for multiple index_part.json files. Discussion/comparison with proposed lease based approach

The problems are outlined in [020. Pageserver S3 Coordination](020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md) and suggested solution includes [Coordination based approach](020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md#coordination-based-approach). This way it will allow to do basic leader election for pageservers so they can decide which node will be responsible for running GC and compaction. The process is based on extensive communication via storage broker and consists of a lease that is taken by one of the pageservers that extends it to continue serving a leader role.

There are two options for ingesting new data into pageserver in follower role. One option is to avoid WAL ingestion at all and rely on notifications from leader to discover new layers on s3. Main downside of this approach is that follower will always lag behind the primary node because it wont have the last layer until it is uploaded to remote storage. In case of a primary failure follower will be required to reingest last segment (up to 256Mb of WAL currently) which slows down recovery. Additionally if compute is connected to follower pageserver it will observe latest data with a delay. Queries from compute will likely experience bigger delays when recent lsn is required.

The second option is to consume WAL stream on both pageservers. In this case the only problem is non deterministic layer generation. Additional bookkeeping will be required to deduplicate layers from primary with local ones. Some process needs to somehow merge them to remove duplicated data. Additionally we need to have good testing coverage to ensure that our implementation of `get_page@lsn` properly handles intersecting layers.

There is another tradeoff. Approaches may be different in amount of traffic between system components. With first approach there can be increased traffic between follower and remote storage. But only in case follower has some activity that actually requests pages (!). With other approach traffic increase will be permanent and will be caused by two WAL streams instead of one.

## Summary

Proposed implementation strategy:

Go with the simplest approach for now. Then work on tech debt, increase test coverage. Then gradually move forward to second approach by implementing safety measures first, finishing with switch of order between ignore and attach operation.

And only then go to lease based approach to solve HA/Pageserver replica use cases.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/024-extension-loading.md:

# Supporting custom user Extensions (Dynamic Extension Loading)
Created 2023-05-03

## Motivation

There are many extensions in the PostgreSQL ecosystem, and not all extensions
are of a quality that we can confidently support them. Additionally, our
current extension inclusion mechanism has several problems because we build all
extensions into the primary Compute image: We build the extensions every time
we build the compute image regardless of whether we actually need to rebuild
the image, and the inclusion of these extensions in the image adds a hard
dependency on all supported extensions - thus increasing the image size, and
with it the time it takes to download that image - increasing first start
latency.

This RFC proposes a dynamic loading mechanism that solves most of these
problems.

## Summary

`compute_ctl` is made responsible for loading extensions on-demand into
the container's file system for dynamically loaded extensions, and will also
make sure that the extensions in `shared_preload_libraries` are downloaded
before the compute node starts.

## Components

compute_ctl, PostgreSQL, neon (extension), Compute Host Node, Extension Store

## Requirements

Compute nodes with no extra extensions should not be negatively impacted by
the existence of support for many extensions.

Installing an extension into PostgreSQL should be easy.

Non-preloaded extensions shouldn't impact startup latency.

Uninstalled extensions shouldn't impact query latency.

A small latency penalty for dynamically loaded extensions is acceptable in
the first seconds of compute startup, but not in steady-state operations.

## Proposed implementation

### On-demand, JIT-loading of extensions

Before postgres starts we download 
- control files for all extensions available to that compute node;
- all `shared_preload_libraries`;

After postgres is running, `compute_ctl` listens for requests to load files.
When PostgreSQL requests a file, `compute_ctl` downloads it.

PostgreSQL requests files in the following cases:
- When loading a preload library set in `local_preload_libraries`
- When explicitly loading a library with `LOAD`
- When creating extension with `CREATE EXTENSION` (download sql scripts, (optional) extension data files and (optional) library files)))


#### Summary

Pros:
 - Startup is only as slow as it takes to load all (shared_)preload_libraries
 - Supports BYO Extension

Cons:
 - O(sizeof(extensions)) IO requirement for loading all extensions.

### Alternative solutions

1. Allow users to add their extensions to the base image
   
   Pros:
    - Easy to deploy

   Cons:
    - Doesn't scale - first start size is dependent on image size;
    - All extensions are shared across all users: It doesn't allow users to
      bring their own restrictive-licensed extensions

2. Bring Your Own compute image
   
   Pros:
    - Still easy to deploy
    - User can bring own patched version of PostgreSQL

   Cons:
    - First start latency is O(sizeof(extensions image))
    - Warm instance pool for skipping pod schedule latency is not feasible with
      O(n) custom images
    - Support channels are difficult to manage

3. Download all user extensions in bulk on compute start
   
   Pros:
    - Easy to deploy
    - No startup latency issues for "clean" users.
    - Warm instance pool for skipping pod schedule latency is possible

   Cons:
    - Downloading all extensions in advance takes a lot of time, thus startup
      latency issues

4. Store user's extensions in persistent storage
   
   Pros:
    - Easy to deploy
    - No startup latency issues
    - Warm instance pool for skipping pod schedule latency is possible

   Cons:
    - EC2 instances have only limited number of attachments shared between EBS
      volumes, direct-attached NVMe drives, and ENIs.
    - Compute instance migration isn't trivially solved for EBS mounts (e.g.
      the device is unavailable whilst moving the mount between instances).
    - EBS can only mount on one instance at a time (except the expensive IO2
      device type).

5. Store user's extensions in network drive
   
   Pros:
    - Easy to deploy
    - Few startup latency issues
    - Warm instance pool for skipping pod schedule latency is possible

   Cons:
    - We'd need networked drives, and a lot of them, which would store many
      duplicate extensions.
    - **UNCHECKED:** Compute instance migration may not work nicely with
      networked IOs


### Idea extensions

The extension store does not have to be S3 directly, but could be a Node-local
caching service on top of S3. This would reduce the load on the network for
popular extensions.

## Extension Storage implementation

The layout of the S3 bucket is as follows:
```
5615610098 // this is an extension build number
├── v14
│   ├── extensions
│   │   ├── anon.tar.zst
│   │   └── embedding.tar.zst
│   └── ext_index.json
└── v15
    ├── extensions
    │   ├── anon.tar.zst
    │   └── embedding.tar.zst
    └── ext_index.json
5615261079
├── v14
│   ├── extensions
│   │   └── anon.tar.zst
│   └── ext_index.json
└── v15
    ├── extensions
    │   └── anon.tar.zst
    └── ext_index.json
5623261088
├── v14
│   ├── extensions
│   │   └── embedding.tar.zst
│   └── ext_index.json
└── v15
    ├── extensions
    │   └── embedding.tar.zst
    └── ext_index.json
```

Note that build number cannot be part of prefix because we might need extensions
from other build numbers.

`ext_index.json` stores the control files and location of extension archives. 
It also stores a list of public extensions and a library_index

We don't need to duplicate `extension.tar.zst`` files.
We only need to upload a new one if it is updated.
(Although currently we just upload every time anyways, hopefully will change
this sometime)

*access* is controlled by spec

More specifically, here is an example ext_index.json
```
{
    "public_extensions": [
        "anon",
        "pg_buffercache"
    ],
    "library_index": {
        "anon": "anon",
        "pg_buffercache": "pg_buffercache"
        // for more complex extensions like postgis
        // we might have something like:
        // address_standardizer: postgis
        // postgis_tiger: postgis
    },
    "extension_data": {
        "pg_buffercache": {
            "control_data": {
                "pg_buffercache.control": "# pg_buffercache extension \ncomment = 'examine the shared buffer cache' \ndefault_version = '1.3' \nmodule_pathname = '$libdir/pg_buffercache' \nrelocatable = true \ntrusted=true"
            },
            "archive_path": "5670669815/v14/extensions/pg_buffercache.tar.zst"
        },
        "anon": {
            "control_data": {
                "anon.control": "# PostgreSQL Anonymizer (anon) extension \ncomment = 'Data anonymization tools' \ndefault_version = '1.1.0' \ndirectory='extension/anon' \nrelocatable = false \nrequires = 'pgcrypto' \nsuperuser = false \nmodule_pathname = '$libdir/anon' \ntrusted = true \n"
            },
            "archive_path": "5670669815/v14/extensions/anon.tar.zst"
        }
    }
}
```

### How to add new extension to the Extension Storage?

Simply upload build artifacts to the S3 bucket.
Implement a CI step for that. Splitting it from compute-node-image build.

### How do we deal with extension versions and updates?

Currently, we rebuild extensions on every compute-node-image build and store them in the <build-version> prefix.
This is needed to ensure that `/share` and `/lib` files are in sync.

For extension updates, we rely on the PostgreSQL extension versioning mechanism (sql update scripts) and extension authors to not break backwards compatibility within one major version of PostgreSQL.

### Alternatives

For extensions written on trusted languages we can also adopt
`dbdev` PostgreSQL Package Manager based on `pg_tle` by Supabase.
This will increase the amount supported extensions and decrease the amount of work required to support them.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/024-user-mgmt.md:

# Postgres user and database management

(This supersedes the previous proposal that looked too complicated and desynchronization-prone)

We've accumulated a bunch of problems with our approach to role and database management, namely:

1. we don't allow role and database creation from Postgres, and users are complaining about that
2. fine-grained role management is not possible both from Postgres and console

Right now, we do store users and databases both in console and Postgres, and there are two main reasons for
that:

* we want to be able to authenticate users in proxy against the console without Postgres' involvement. Otherwise,
malicious brute force attempts will wake up Postgres (expensive) and may exhaust the Postgres connections limit (deny of service).
* it is handy when we can render console UI without waking up compute (e.g., show database list)

This RFC doesn't talk about giving root access to the database, which is blocked by a secure runtime setup.

## Overview

* Add Postgres extension that sends an HTTP request each time transaction that modifies users/databases is about to commit.
* Add user management API to internal console API. Also, the console should put a JWT token into the compute so that it can access management API.

## Postgres behavior

The default user role (@username) should have `CREATE ROLE`, `CREATE DB`, and `BYPASSRLS` privileges. We expose the Postgres port
to the open internet, so we need to check password strength. Now console generates strong passwords, so there is no risk of having dumb passwords. With user-provided passwords, such risks exist.

Since we store passwords in the console we should also send unencrypted password when role is created/changed. Hence communication with the console must be encrypted. Postgres also supports creating roles using hashes, in that case, we will not be able to get a raw password. So I can see the following options here:
  * roles created via SQL will *not* have raw passwords in the console
  * roles created via SQL will have raw passwords in the console, except ones that were created using hashes

I'm leaning towards the second option here as it is a bit more consistent one -- if raw password storage is enabled then we store passwords in all cases where we can store them.

To send data about roles and databases from Postgres to the console we can create the following Postgres extension:

  * Intercept role/database changes in `ProcessUtility_hook`. Here we have access to the query statement with the raw password. The hook handler itself should not dial the console immediately and rather stash info in some hashmap for later use.
  * When the transaction is about to commit we execute collected role modifications (all as one -- console should either accept all or reject all, and hence API shouldn't be REST-like). If the console request fails we can roll back the transaction. This way if the transaction is committed we know for sure that console has this information. We can use `XACT_EVENT_PRE_COMMIT` and `XACT_EVENT_PARALLEL_PRE_COMMIT` for that.
  * Extension should be mindful of the fact that it is possible to create and delete roles within the transaction.
  * We also need to track who is database owner, some coding around may be needed to get the current user when the database is created.

## Console user management API

The current public API has REST API for role management. We need to have some analog for the internal API (called mgmt API in the console code). But unlike public API here we want to have an atomic way to create several roles/databases (in cases when several roles were created in the same transaction). So something like that may work:

```
curl -X PATCH /api/v1/roles_and_databases -d '
[
    {"op":"create", "type":"role", "name": "kurt", "password":"lYgT3BlbkFJ2vBZrqv"},
    {"op":"drop", "type":"role", "name": "trout"},
    {"op":"alter", "type":"role", "name": "kilgore", "password":"3BlbkFJ2vB"},
    {"op":"create", "type":"database", "name": "db2", "owner": "eliot"},
]
'
```

Makes sense not to error out on duplicated create/delete operations (see failure modes)

## Managing users from the console

Now console puts a spec file with the list of databases/roles and delta operations in all the compute pods. `compute_ctl` then picks up that file and stubbornly executes deltas and checks data in the spec file is the same as in the Postgres. This way if the user creates a role in the UI we restart compute with a new spec file and during the start databases/roles are created. So if Postgres send an HTTP call each time role is created we need to break recursion in that case. We can do that based on application_name or some GUC or user (local == no HTTP hook).

Generally, we have several options when we are creating users via console:

1. restart compute with a new spec file, execute local SQL command; cut recursion in the extension
2. "push" spec files into running compute, execute local SQL command; cut recursion in the extension
3. "push" spec files into running compute, execute local SQL command; let extension create those roles in the console
4. avoid managing roles via spec files, send SQL commands to compute; let extension create those roles in the console

The last option is the most straightforward one, but with the raw password storage opt-out, we will not have the password to establish an SQL connection. Also, we need a spec for provisioning purposes and to address potential desync (but that is quite unlikely). So I think the easiest approach would be:

1. keep role management like it is now and cut the recursion in the extension when SQL is executed by compute_ctl
2. add "push" endpoint to the compute_ctl to avoid compute restart during the `apply_config` operation -- that can be done as a follow up to avoid increasing scope too much

## Failure modes

* during role creation via SQL role was created in the console but the connection was dropped before Postgres got acknowledgment or some error happened after acknowledgment (out of disk space, deadlock, etc):

  in that case, Postgres won't have a role that exists in the console. Compute restart will heal it (due to the spec file). Also if the console allows repeated creation/deletion user can repeat the transaction.


# Scalability

On my laptop, I can create 4200 roles per second. That corresponds to 363 million roles per day. Since each role creation ends up in the console database we can add some limit to the number of roles (could be reasonably big to not run into it often -- like 1k or 10k).


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/025-generation-numbers.md:

# Pageserver: split-brain safety for remote storage through generation numbers

## Summary

A scheme of logical "generation numbers" for tenant attachment to pageservers is proposed, along with
changes to the remote storage format to include these generation numbers in S3 keys.

Using the control plane as the issuer of these generation numbers enables strong anti-split-brain
properties in the pageserver cluster without implementing a consensus mechanism directly
in the pageservers.

## Motivation

Currently, the pageserver's remote storage format does not provide a mechanism for addressing
split brain conditions that may happen when replacing a node or when migrating
a tenant from one pageserver to another.

From a remote storage perspective, a split brain condition occurs whenever two nodes both think
they have the same tenant attached, and both can write to S3. This can happen in the case of a
network partition, pathologically long delays (e.g. suspended VM), or software bugs.

In the current deployment model, control plane guarantees that a tenant is attached to one
pageserver at a time, thereby ruling out split-brain conditions resulting from dual
attachment (however, there is always the risk of a control plane bug). This control
plane guarantee prevents robust response to failures, as if a pageserver is unresponsive
we may not detach from it. The mechanism in this RFC fixes this, by making it safe to
attach to a new, different pageserver even if an unresponsive pageserver may be running.

Further lack of safety during split-brain conditions blocks two important features where occasional
split-brain conditions are part of the design assumptions:

- seamless tenant migration ([RFC PR](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/5029))
- automatic pageserver instance failure handling (aka "failover") (RFC TBD)

### Prior art

- 020-pageserver-s3-coordination.md
- 023-the-state-of-pageserver-tenant-relocation.md
- 026-pageserver-s3-mvcc.md

This RFC has broad similarities to the proposal to implement a MVCC scheme in
S3 object names, but this RFC avoids a general purpose transaction scheme in
favour of more specialized "generations" that work like a transaction ID that
always has the same lifetime as a pageserver process or tenant attachment, whichever
is shorter.

## Requirements

- Accommodate storage backends with no atomic or fencing capability (i.e. work within
  S3's limitation that there are no atomics and clients can't be fenced)
- Don't depend on any STONITH or node fencing in the compute layer (i.e. we will not
  assume that we can reliably kill and EC2 instance and have it die)
- Scoped per-tenant, not per-pageserver; for _seamless tenant migration_, we need
  per-tenant granularity, and for _failover_, we likely want to spread the workload
  of the failed pageserver instance to a number of peers, rather than monolithically
  moving the entire workload to another machine.
  We do not rule out the latter case, but should not constrain ourselves to it.

## Design Tenets

These are not requirements, but are ideas that guide the following design:

- Avoid implementing another consensus system: we already have a strongly consistent
  database in the control plane that can do atomic operations where needed, and we also
  have a Paxos implementation in the safekeeper.
- Avoiding locking in to specific models of how failover will work (e.g. do not assume that
  all the tenants on a pageserver will fail over as a unit).
- Be strictly correct when it comes to data integrity. Occasional failures of availability
  are tolerable, occasional data loss is not.

## Non Goals

The changes in this RFC intentionally isolate the design decision of how to define
logical generations numbers and object storage format in a way that is somewhat flexible with
respect to how actual orchestration of failover works.

This RFC intentionally does not cover:

- Failure detection
- Orchestration of failover
- Standby modes to keep data ready for fast migration
- Intentional multi-writer operation on tenants (multi-writer scenarios are assumed to be transient split-brain situations).
- Sharding.

The interaction between this RFC and those features is discussed in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-interoperability-with-other-features)

## Impacted Components

pageserver, control plane, safekeeper (optional)

## Implementation Part 1: Correctness

### Summary

- A per-tenant **generation number** is introduced to uniquely identifying tenant attachments to pageserver processes.

  - This generation number increments each time the control plane modifies a tenant (`Project`)'s assigned pageserver, or when the assigned pageserver restarts.
  - the control plane is the authority for generation numbers: only it may
    increment a generation number.

- **Object keys are suffixed** with the generation number
- **Safety for multiply-attached tenants** is provided by the
  generation number in the object key: the competing pageservers will not
  try to write to the same keys.
- **Safety in split brain for multiple nodes running with
  the same node ID** is provided by the pageserver calling out to the control plane
  on startup, to re-attach and thereby increment the generations of any attached tenants
- **Safety for deletions** is achieved by deferring the DELETE from S3 to a point in time where the deleting node has validated with control plane that no attachment with a higher generation has a reference to the to-be-DELETEd key.
- **The control plane is used to issue generation numbers** to avoid the need for
  a built-in consensus system in the pageserver, although this could in principle
  be changed without changing the storage format.

### Generation numbers

A generation number is associated with each tenant in the control plane,
and each time the attachment status of the tenant changes, this is incremented.
Changes in attachment status include:

- Attaching the tenant to a different pageserver
- A pageserver restarting, and "re-attaching" its tenants on startup

These increments of attachment generation provide invariants we need to avoid
split-brain issues in storage:

- If two pageservers have the same tenant attached, the attachments are guaranteed to have different generation numbers, because the generation would increment
  while attaching the second one.
- If there are multiple pageservers running with the same node ID, all the attachments on all pageservers are guaranteed to have different generation numbers, because the generation would increment
  when the second node started and re-attached its tenants.

As long as the infrastructure does not transparently replace an underlying
physical machine, we are totally safe. See the later [unsafe case](#unsafe-case-on-badly-behaved-infrastructure) section for details.

### Object Key Changes

#### Generation suffix

All object keys (layer objects and index objects) will contain the attachment
generation as a [suffix](#why-a-generation-suffix-rather-than-prefix).
This suffix is the primary mechanism for protecting against split-brain situations, and
enabling safe multi-attachment of tenants:

- Two pageservers running with the same node ID (e.g. after a failure, where there is
  some rogue pageserver still running) will not try to write to the same objects, because at startup they will have re-attached tenants and thereby incremented
  generation numbers.
- Multiple attachments (to different pageservers) of the same tenant will not try to write to the same objects, as each attachment would have a distinct generation.

The generation is appended in hex format (8 byte string representing
u32), to all our existing key names. A u32's range limit would permit
27 restarts _per second_ over a 5 year system lifetime: orders of magnitude more than
is realistic.

The exact meaning of the generation suffix can evolve over time if necessary, for
example if we chose to implement a failover mechanism internally to the pageservers
rather than going via the control plane. The storage format just sees it as a number,
with the only semantic property being that the highest numbered index is the latest.

#### Index changes

Since object keys now include a generation suffix, the index of these keys must also be updated. IndexPart currently stores keys and LSNs sufficient to reconstruct key names: this would be extended to store the generation as well.

This will increase the size of the file, but only modestly: layers are already encoded as
their string-ized form, so the overhead is about 10 bytes per layer. This will be less if/when
the index storage format is migrated to a binary format from JSON.

#### Visibility

_This section doesn't describe code changes, but extends on the consequences of the
object key changes given above_

##### Visibility of objects to pageservers

Pageservers can of course list objects in S3 at any time, but in practice their
visible set is based on the contents of their LayerMap, which is initialized
from the `index_part.json.???` that they load.

Starting with the `index_part` from the most recent previous generation
(see [loading index_part](#finding-the-remote-indices-for-timelines)), a pageserver
initially has visibility of all the objects that were referenced in the loaded index.
These objects are guaranteed to remain visible until the current generation is
superseded, via pageservers in older generations avoiding deletions (see [deletion](#deletion)).

The "most recent previous generation" is _not_ necessarily the most recent
in terms of walltime, it is the one that is readable at the time a new generation
starts. Consider the following sequence of a tenant being re-attached to different
pageserver nodes:

- Create + attach on PS1 in generation 1
- PS1 Do some work, write out index_part.json-0001
- Attach to PS2 in generation 2
- Read index_part.json-0001
- PS2 starts doing some work...
- Attach to PS3 in generation 3
- Read index_part.json-0001
- **...PS2 finishes its work: now it writes index_part.json-0002**
- PS3 writes out index_part.json-0003

In the above sequence, the ancestry of indices is:

```
0001 -> 0002
     |
     -> 0003
```

This is not an issue for safety: if the 0002 references some object that is
not in 0001, then 0003 simply does not see it, and will re-do whatever
work was required (e.g. ingesting WAL or doing compaction). Objects referenced
by only the 0002 index will never be read by future attachment generations, and
will eventually be cleaned up by a scrub (see [scrubbing](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing)).

##### Visibility of LSNs to clients

Because index_part.json is now written with a generation suffix, which data
is visible depends on which generation the reader is operating in:

- If one was passively reading from S3 from outside of a pageserver, the
  visibility of data would depend on which index_part.json-<generation> file
  one had chosen to read from.
- If two pageservers have the same tenant attached, they may have different
  data visible as they're independently replaying the WAL, and maintaining
  independent LayerMaps that are written to independent index_part.json files.
  Data does not have to be remotely committed to be visible.
- For a pageserver writing with a stale generation, historic LSNs
  remain readable until another pageserver (with a higher generation suffix)
  decides to execute GC deletions. At this point, we may think of the stale
  attachment's generation as having logically ended: during its existence
  the generation had a consistent view of the world.
- For a newly attached pageserver, its highest visible LSN may appears to
  go backwards with respect to an earlier attachment, if that earlier
  attachment had not uploaded all data to S3 before the new attachment.

### Deletion

#### Generation number validation

While writes are de-conflicted by writers always using their own generation number in the key,
deletions are slightly more challenging: if a pageserver A is isolated, and the true active node is
pageserver B, then it is dangerous for A to do any object deletions, even of objects that it wrote
itself, because pageserver's B metadata might reference those objects.

We solve this by inserting a "generation validation" step between the write of a remote index
that un-links a particular object from the index, and the actual deletion of the object, such
that deletions strictly obey the following ordering:

1. Write out index_part.json: this guarantees that any subsequent reader of the metadata will
   not try and read the object we unlinked.
2. Call out to control plane to validate that the generation which we use for our attachment is still the latest.
3. If step 2 passes, it is safe to delete the object. Why? The check-in with control plane
   together with our visibility rules guarantees that any later generation
   will use either the exact `index_part.json` that we uploaded in step 1, or a successor
   of it; not an earlier one. In both cases, the `index_part.json` doesn't reference the
   key we are deleting anymore, so, the key is invisible to any later attachment generation.
   Hence it's safe to delete it.

Note that at step 2 we are only confirming that deletions of objects _no longer referenced
by the specific `index_part.json` written in step 1_ are safe. If we were attempting other deletions concurrently,
these would need their own generation validation step.

If step 2 fails, we may leak the object. This is safe, but has a cost: see [scrubbing](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing). We may avoid this entirely outside of node
failures, if we do proper flushing of deletions on clean shutdown and clean migration.

To avoid doing a huge number of control plane requests to perform generation validation,
validation of many tenants will be done in a single request, and deletions will be queued up
prior to validation: see [Persistent deletion queue](#persistent-deletion-queue) for more.

#### `remote_consistent_lsn` updates

Remote objects are not the only kind of deletion the pageserver does: it also indirectly deletes
WAL data, by feeding back remote_consistent_lsn to safekeepers, as a signal to the safekeepers that
they may drop data below this LSN.

For the same reasons that deletion of objects must be guarded by an attachment generation number
validation step, updates to `remote_consistent_lsn` are subject to the same rules, using
an ordering as follows:

1. upload the index_part that covers data up to LSN `L0` to S3
2. Call out to control plane to validate that the generation which we use for our attachment is still the latest.
3. advance the `remote_consistent_lsn` that we advertise to the safekeepers to `L0`

If step 2 fails, then the `remote_consistent_lsn` advertised
to safekeepers will not advance again until a pageserver
with the latest generation is ready to do so.

**Note:** at step 3 we are not advertising the _latest_ remote_consistent_lsn, we are
advertising the value in the index_part that we uploaded in step 1. This provides
a strong ordering guarantee.

Internally to the pageserver, each timeline will have two remote_consistent_lsn values: the one that
reflects its latest write to remote storage, and the one that reflects the most
recent validation of generation number. It is only the latter value that may
be advertised to the outside world (i.e. to the safekeeper).

The control plane remains unaware of `remote_consistent_lsn`: it only has to validate
the freshness of generation numbers, thereby granting the pageserver permission to
share the information with the safekeeper.

For convenience, in subsequent sections and RFCs we will use "deletion" to mean both deletion
of objects in S3, and updates to the `remote_consistent_lsn`, as updates to the remote consistent
LSN are de-facto deletions done via the safekeeper, and both kinds of deletion are subject to
the same generation validation requirement.

### Pageserver attach/startup changes

#### Attachment

Calls to `/v1/tenant/{tenant_id}/attach` are augmented with an additional
`generation` field in the body.

The pageserver does not persist this: a generation is only good for the lifetime
of a process.

#### Finding the remote indices for timelines

Because index files are now suffixed with generation numbers, the pageserver
cannot always GET the remote index in one request, because it can't always
know a-priori what the latest remote index is.

Typically, the most recent generation to write an index would be our own
generation minus 1. However, this might not be the case: the previous
node might have started and acquired a generation number, and then crashed
before writing out a remote index.

In the general case and as a fallback, the pageserver may list all the `index_part.json`
files for a timeline, sort them by generation, and pick the highest that is `<=`
its current generation for this attachment. The tenant should never load an index
with an attachment generation _newer_ than its own.
These two rules combined ensure that objects written by later generations are never visible to earlier generations.

Note that if a given attachment picks an index part from an earlier generation (say n-2), but crashes & restarts before it writes its own generation's index part, next time it tries to pick an index part there may be an index part from generation n-1.
It would pick the n-1 index part in that case, because it's sorted higher than the previous one from generation n-2.
So, above rules guarantee no determinism in selecting the index part.
are allowed to be attached with stale attachment generations during a multiply-attached
phase in a migration, and in this instance if the old location's pageserver restarts,
it should not try and load the newer generation's index.

To summarize, on starting a timeline, the pageserver will:

1. Issue a GET for index_part.json-<my generation - 1>
2. If 1 failed, issue a ListObjectsv2 request for index_part.json\* and
   pick the newest.

One could optimize this further by using the control plane to record specifically
which generation most recently wrote an index_part.json, if necessary, to increase
the probability of finding the index_part.json in one GET. One could also improve
the chances by having pageservers proactively write out index_part.json after they
get a new generation ID.

#### Re-attachment on startup

On startup, the pageserver will call out to an new control plane `/re-attach`
API (see [Generation API](#generation-api)). This returns a list of
tenants that should be attached to the pageserver, and their generation numbers, which
the control plane will increment before returning.

The pageserver should still scan its local disk on startup, but should _delete_
any local content for tenants not indicated in the `/re-attach` response: their
absence is an implicit detach operation.

**Note** if a tenant is omitted from the re-attach response, its local disk content
will be deleted. This will change in subsequent work, when the control plane gains
the concept of a secondary/standby location: a node with local content may revert
to this status and retain some local content.

#### Cleaning up previous generations' remote indices

Deletion of old indices is not necessary for correctness, although it is necessary
to avoid the ListObjects fallback in the previous section becoming ever more expensive.

Once the new attachment has written out its index_part.json, it may asynchronously clean up historic index_part.json
objects that were found.

We may choose to implement this deletion either as an explicit step after we
write out index_part for the first time in a pageserver's lifetime, or for
simplicity just do it periodically as part of the background scrub (see [scrubbing](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing));

### Control Plane Changes

#### Store generations for attaching tenants

- The `Project` table must store the generation number for use when
  attaching the tenant to a new pageserver.
- The `/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/attach` pageserver API will require the generation number,
  which the control plane can supply by simply incrementing the `Project`'s
  generation number each time the tenant is attached to a different server: the same database
  transaction that changes the assigned pageserver should also change the generation number.

#### Generation API

This section describes an API that could be provided directly by the control plane,
or built as a separate microservice. In earlier parts of the RFC, when we
discuss the control plane providing generation numbers, we are referring to this API.

The API endpoints used by the pageserver to acquire and validate generation
numbers are quite simple, and only require access to some persistent and
linerizable storage (such as a database).

Building this into the control plane is proposed as a least-effort option to exploit existing infrastructure and implement generation number issuance in the same transaction that mandates it (i.e., the transaction that updates the `Project` assignment to another pageserver).
However, this is not mandatory: this "Generation Number Issuer" could
be built as a microservice. In practice, we will write such a miniature service
anyway, to enable E2E pageserver/compute testing without control plane.

The endpoints required by pageservers are:

##### `/re-attach`

- Request: `{node_id: <u32>}`
- Response:
  - 200 `{tenants: [{id: <TenantId>, gen: <u32>}]}`
  - 404: unknown node_id
  - (Future: 429: flapping detected, perhaps nodes are fighting for the same node ID,
    or perhaps this node was in a retry loop)
  - (On unknown tenants, omit tenant from `tenants` array)
- Server behavior: query database for which tenants should be attached to this pageserver.
  - for each tenant that should be attached, increment the attachment generation and
    include the new generation in the response
- Client behavior:
  - for all tenants in the response, activate with the new generation number
  - for any local disk content _not_ referenced in the response, act as if we
    had been asked to detach it (i.e. delete local files)

**Note** the `node_id` in this request will change in future if we move to ephemeral
node IDs, to be replaced with some correlation ID that helps the control plane realize
if a process is running with the same storage as a previous pageserver process (e.g.
we might use EC instance ID, or we might just write some UUID to the disk the first
time we use it)

##### `/validate`

- Request: `{'tenants': [{tenant: <tenant id>, attach_gen: <gen>}, ...]}'`
- Response:
  - 200 `{'tenants': [{tenant: <tenant id>, status: <bool>}...]}`
  - (On unknown tenants, omit tenant from `tenants` array)
- Purpose: enable the pageserver to discover for the given attachments whether they are still the latest.
- Server behavior: this is a read-only operation: simply compare the generations in the request with
  the generations known to the server, and set status to `true` if they match.
- Client behavior: clients must not do deletions within a tenant's remote data until they have
  received a response indicating the generation they hold for the attachment is current.

#### Use of `/load` and `/ignore` APIs

Because the pageserver will be changed to only attach tenants on startup
based on the control plane's response to a `/re-attach` request, the load/ignore
APIs no longer make sense in their current form.

The `/load` API becomes functionally equivalent to attach, and will be removed:
any location that used `/load` before should just attach instead.

The `/ignore` API is equivalent to detaching, but without deleting local files.

### Timeline/Branch creation & deletion

All of the previous arguments for safety have described operations within
a timeline, where we may describe a sequence that includes updates to
index_part.json, and where reads and writes are coming from a postgres
endpoint (writes via the safekeeper).

Creating or destroying timeline is a bit different, because writes
are coming from the control plane.

We must be safe against scenarios such as:

- A tenant is attached to pageserver B while pageserver A is
  in the middle of servicing an RPC from the control plane to
  create or delete a tenant.
- A pageserver A has been sent a timeline creation request
  but becomes unresponsive. The tenant is attached to a
  different pageserver B, and the timeline creation request
  is sent there too.

#### Timeline Creation

If some very slow node tries to do a timeline creation _after_
a more recent generation node has already created the timeline
and written some data into it, that must not cause harm. This
is provided in timeline creations by the way all the objects
within the timeline's remote path include a generation suffix:
a slow node in an old generation that attempts to "create" a timeline
that already exists will just emit an index_part.json with
an old generation suffix.

Timeline IDs are never reused, so we don't have
to worry about the case of create/delete/create cycles. If they
were re-used during a disaster recovery "un-delete" of a timeline,
that special case can be handled by calling out to all available pageservers
to check that they return 404 for the timeline, and to flush their
deletion queues in case they had any deletions pending from the
timeline.

The above makes it safe for control plane to change the assignment of
tenant to pageserver in control plane while a timeline creation is ongoing.
The reason is that the creation request against the new assigned pageserver
uses a new generation number. However, care must be taken by control plane
to ensure that a "timeline creation successful" response from some pageserver
is checked for the pageserver's generation for that timeline's tenant still being the latest.
If it is not the latest, the response does not constitute a successful timeline creation.
It is acceptable to discard such responses, the scrubber will clean up the S3 state.
It is better to issue a timeline deletion request to the stale attachment.

#### Timeline Deletion

Tenant/timeline deletion operations are exempt from generation validation
on deletes, and therefore don't have to go through the same deletion
queue as GC/compaction layer deletions. This is because once a
delete is issued by the control plane, it is a promise that the
control plane will keep trying until the deletion is done, so even stale
pageservers are permitted to go ahead and delete the objects.

The implications of this for control plane are:

- During timeline/tenant deletion, the control plane must wait for the deletion to
  be truly complete (status 404) and also handle the case where the pageserver
  becomes unavailable, either by waiting for a replacement with the same node_id,
  or by *re-attaching the tenant elsewhere.

- The control plane must persist its intent to delete
  a timeline/tenant before issuing any RPCs, and then once it starts, it must
  keep retrying until the tenant/timeline is gone. This is already handled
  by using a persistent `Operation` record that is retried indefinitely.

Timeline deletion may result in a special kind of object leak, where
the latest generation attachment completes a deletion (including erasing
all objects in the timeline path), but some slow/partitioned node is
writing into the timeline path with a stale generation number. This would
not be caught by any per-timeline scrubbing (see [scrubbing](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing)), since scrubbing happens on the
attached pageserver, and once the timeline is deleted it isn't attached anywhere.
This scenario should be pretty rare, and the control plane can make it even
rarer by ensuring that if a tenant is in a multi-attached state (e.g. during
migration), we wait for that to complete before processing the deletion. Beyond
that, we may implement some other top-level scrub of timelines in
an external tool, to identify any tenant/timeline paths that are not found
in the control plane database.

#### Examples

- Deletion, node restarts partway through:
  - By the time we returned 202, we have written a remote delete marker
  - Any subsequent incarnation of the same node_id will see the remote
    delete marker and continue to process the deletion
  - If the original pageserver is lost permanently and no replacement
    with the same node_id is available, then the control plane must recover
    by re-attaching the tenant to a different node.
- Creation, node becomes unresponsive partway through.
  - Control plane will see HTTP request timeout, keep re-issuing
    request to whoever is the latest attachment point for the tenant
    until it succeeds.
  - Stale nodes may be trying to execute timeline creation: they will
    write out index_part.json files with
    stale attachment generation: these will be eventually cleaned up
    by the same mechanism as other old indices.

### Unsafe case on badly behaved infrastructure

This section is only relevant if running on a different environment
than EC2 machines with ephemeral disks.

If we ever run pageservers on infrastructure that might transparently restart
a pageserver while leaving an old process running (e.g. a VM gets rescheduled
without the old one being fenced), then there is a risk of corruption, when
the control plane attaches the tenant, as follows:

- If the control plane sends an `/attach` request to node A, then node A dies
  and is replaced, and the control plane's retries the request without
  incrementing that attachment ID, then it could end up with two physical nodes
  both using the same generation number.
- This is not an issue when using EC2 instances with ephemeral storage, as long
  as the control plane never re-uses a node ID, but it would need re-examining
  if running on different infrastructure.
- To robustly protect against this class of issue, we would either:
  - add a "node generation" to distinguish between different processes holding the
    same node_id.
  - or, dispense with static node_id entirely and issue an ephemeral ID to each
    pageserver process when it starts.

## Implementation Part 2: Optimizations

### Persistent deletion queue

Between writing our a new index_part.json that doesn't reference an object,
and executing the deletion, an object passes through a window where it is
only referenced in memory, and could be leaked if the pageserver is stopped
uncleanly. That introduces conflicting incentives: on the one hand, we would
like to delay and batch deletions to
1. minimize the cost of the mandatory validations calls to control plane, and
2. minimize cost for DeleteObjects requests.
On the other hand we would also like to minimize leakage by executing
deletions promptly.

To resolve this, we may make the deletion queue persistent
and then executing these in the background at a later time.

_Note: The deletion queue's reason for existence is optimization rather than correctness,
so there is a lot of flexibility in exactly how the it should work,
as long as it obeys the rule to validate generations before executing deletions,
so the following details are not essential to the overall RFC._

#### Scope

The deletion queue will be global per pageserver, not per-tenant. There
are several reasons for this choice:

- Use the queue as a central point to coalesce validation requests to the
  control plane: this avoids individual `Timeline` objects ever touching
  the control plane API, and avoids them having to know the rules about
  validating deletions. This separation of concerns will avoid burdening
  the already many-LoC `Timeline` type with even more responsibility.
- Decouple the deletion queue from Tenant attachment lifetime: we may
  "hibernate" an inactive tenant by tearing down its `Tenant`/`Timeline`
  objects in the pageserver, without having to wait for deletions to be done.
- Amortize the cost of I/O for the persistent queue, instead of having many
  tiny queues.
- Coalesce deletions into a smaller number of larger DeleteObjects calls

Because of the cost of doing I/O for persistence, and the desire to coalesce
generation validation requests across tenants, and coalesce deletions into
larger DeleteObjects requests, there will be one deletion queue per pageserver
rather than one per tenant. This has the added benefit that when deactivating
a tenant, we do not have to drain their deletion queue: deletions can proceed
for a tenant whose main `Tenant` object has been torn down.

#### Flow of deletion

The flow of a deletion is becomes:

1. Need for deletion of an object (=> layer file) is identified.
2. Unlink the object from all the places that reference it (=> `index_part.json`).
3. Enqueue the deletion to a persistent queue.
   Each entry is `tenant_id, attachment_generation, S3 key`.
4. Validate & execute in batches:
  4.1 For a batch of entries, call into control plane.
  4.2 For the subset of entries that passed validation, execute a `DeleteObjects` S3 DELETE request for their S3 keys.

As outlined in the Part 1 on correctness, it is critical that deletions are only
executed once the key is not referenced anywhere in S3.
This property is obviously upheld by the scheme above.

#### We Accept Object Leakage In Acceptable Circumstances

If we crash in the flow above between (2) and (3), we lose track of unreferenced object.
Further, enqueuing a single to the persistent queue may not be durable immediately to amortize cost of flush to disk.
This is acceptable for now, it can be caught by [the scrubber](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing).

There are various measures we can take to improve this in the future.
1. Cap amount of time until enqueued entry becomes durable (timeout for flush-to-tisk)
2. Proactively flush:
    - On graceful shutdown, as we anticipate that some or
      all of our attachments may be re-assigned while we are offline.
    - On tenant detach.
3. For each entry, keep track of whether it has passed (2).
   Only admit entries to (4) one they have passed (2).
   This requires re-writing / two queue entries (intent, commit) per deletion.

The important take-away with any of the above is that it's not
disastrous to leak objects in exceptional circumstances.

#### Operations that may skip the queue

Deletions of an entire timeline are [exempt](#Timeline-Deletion) from generation number validation. Once the
control plane sends the deletion request, there is no requirement to retain the readability
of any data within the timeline, and all objects within the timeline path may be deleted
at any time from the control plane's deletion request onwards.

Since deletions of smaller timelines won't have enough objects to compose a full sized
DeleteObjects request, it is still useful to send these through the last part of the
deletion pipeline to coalesce with other executing deletions: to enable this, the
deletion queue should expose two input channels: one for deletions that must be
processed in a generation-aware way, and a fast path for timeline deletions, where
that fast path may skip validation and the persistent queue.

### Cleaning up orphan objects (scrubbing)

An orphan object is any object which is no longer referenced by a running node or by metadata.

Examples of how orphan objects arise:

- A node PUTs a layer object, then crashes before it writes the
  index_part.json that references that layer.
- A stale node carries on running for some time, and writes out an unbounded number of
  objects while it believes itself to be the rightful writer for a tenant.
- A pageserver crashes between un-linking an object from the index, and persisting
  the object to its deletion queue.

Orphan objects are functionally harmless, but have a small cost due to S3 capacity consumed. We
may clean them up at some time in the future, but doing a ListObjectsv2 operation and cross
referencing with the latest metadata to identify objects which are not referenced.

Scrubbing will be done only by an attached pageserver (not some third party process), and deletions requested during scrub will go through the same
validation as all other deletions: the attachment generation must be
fresh. This avoids the possibility of a stale pageserver incorrectly
thinking than an object written by a newer generation is stale, and deleting
it.

It is not strictly necessary that scrubbing be done by an attached
pageserver: it could also be done externally. However, an external
scrubber would still require the same validation procedure that
a pageserver's deletion queue performs, before actually erasing
objects.

## Operational impact

### Availability

Coordination of generation numbers via the control plane introduce a dependency for certain
operations:

1. Starting new pageservers (or activating pageservers after a restart)
2. Executing enqueued deletions
3. Advertising updated `remote_consistent_lsn` to enable WAL trimming

Item 1. would mean that some in-place restarts that previously would have resumed service even if the control plane were
unavailable, will now not resume service to users until the control plane is available. We could
avoid this by having a timeout on communication with the control plane, and after some timeout,
resume service with the previous generation numbers (assuming this was persisted to disk). However,
this is unlikely to be needed as the control plane is already an essential & highly available component. Also, having a node re-use an old generation number would complicate
reasoning about the system, as it would break the invariant that a generation number uniquely identifies
a tenant's attachment to a given pageserver _process_: it would merely identify the tenant's attachment
to the pageserver _machine_ or its _on-disk-state_.

Item 2. is a non-issue operationally: it's harmless to delay deletions, the only impact of objects pending deletion is
the S3 capacity cost.

Item 3. could be an issue if safekeepers are low on disk space and the control plane is unavailable for a long time. If this became an issue,
we could adjust the safekeeper to delete segments from local disk sooner, as soon as they're uploaded to S3, rather than waiting for
remote_consistent_lsn to advance.

For a managed service, the general approach should be to make sure we are monitoring & respond fast enough
that control plane outages are bounded in time.

There is also the fact that control plane runs in a single region.
The latency for distant regions is not a big concern for us because all request types added by this RFC are either infrequent or not in the way of the data path.
However, we lose region isolation for the operations listed above.
The ongoing work to split console and control will give us per-region control plane, and all operations in this RFC can be handled by these per-region control planes.
With that in mind, we accept the trade-offs outlined in this paragraph.

We will also implement an "escape hatch" config generation numbers, where in a major disaster outage,
we may manually run pageservers with a hand-selected generation number, so that we can bring them online
independently of a control plane.

### Rollout

Although there is coupling between components, we may deploy most of the new data plane components
independently of the control plane: initially they can just use a static generation number.

#### Phase 1

The pageserver is deployed with some special config to:

- Always act like everything is generation 1 and do not wait for a control plane issued generation on attach
- Skip the places in deletion and remote_consistent_lsn updates where we would call into control plane

#### Phase 2

The control plane changes are deployed: control plane will now track and increment generation numbers.

#### Phase 3

The pageserver is deployed with its control-plane-dependent changes enabled: it will now require
the control plane to service re-attach requests on startup, and handle generation
validation requests.

### On-disk backward compatibility

Backward compatibility with existing data is straightforward:

- When reading the index, we may assume that any layer whose metadata doesn't include
  generations will have a path without generation suffix.
- When locating the index file on attachment, we may use the "fallback" listing path
  and if there is only an index without generation suffix, that is the one we load.

It is not necessary to re-write existing layers: even new index files will be able
to represent generation-less layers.

### On-disk forward compatibility

We will do a two phase rollout, probably over multiple releases because we will naturally
have some of the read-side code ready before the overall functionality is ready:

1. Deploy pageservers which understand the new index format and generation suffixes
   in keys, but do not write objects with generation numbers in the keys.
2. Deploy pageservers that write objects with generation numbers in the keys.

Old pageservers will be oblivious to generation numbers. That means that they can't
read objects with generation numbers in the name. This is why we must
first step must deploy the ability to read, before the second step
starts writing them.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why a generation _suffix_ rather than _prefix_?

The choice is motivated by object listing, since one can list by prefix but not
suffix.

In [finding remote indices](#finding-the-remote-indices-for-timelines), we rely
on being able to do a prefix listing for `<tenant>/<timeline>/index_part.json*`.
That relies on the prefix listing.

The converse case of using a generation prefix and listing by generation is
not needed: one could imagine listing by generation while scrubbing (so that
a particular generation's layers could be scrubbed), but this is not part
of normal operations, and the [scrubber](#cleaning-up-orphan-objects-scrubbing) probably won't work that way anyway.

## Wouldn't it be simpler to have a separate deletion queue per timeline?

Functionally speaking, we could. That's how RemoteTimelineClient currently works,
but this approach does not map well to a long-lived persistent queue with
generation validation.

Anything we do per-timeline generates tiny random I/O, on a pageserver with
tens of thousands of timelines operating: to be ready for high scale, we should:

- A) Amortize costs where we can (e.g. a shared deletion queue)
- B) Expect to put tenants into a quiescent state while they're not
  busy: i.e. we shouldn't keep a tenant alive to service its deletion queue.

This was discussed in the [scope](#scope) part of the deletion queue section.

# Appendix A: Examples of use in high availability/failover

The generation numbers proposed in this RFC are adaptable to a variety of different
failover scenarios and models. The sections below sketch how they would work in practice.

### In-place restart of a pageserver

"In-place" here means that the restart is done before any other element in the system
has taken action in response to the node being down.

- After restart, the node issues a re-attach request to the control plane, and
  receives new generation numbers for all its attached tenants.
- Tenants may be activated with the generation number in the re-attach response.
- If any of its attachments were in fact stale (i.e. had be reassigned to another
  node while this node was offline), then
  - the re-attach response will inform the tenant about this by not including
    the tenant of this by _not_ incrementing the generation for that attachment.
  - This will implicitly block deletions in the tenant, but as an optimization
    the pageserver should also proactively stop doing S3 uploads when it notices this stale-generation state.
  - The control plane is expected to eventually detach this tenant from the
    pageserver.

If the control plane does not include a tenant in the re-attach response,
but there is still local state for the tenant in the filesystem, the pageserver
deletes the local state in response and does not load/active the tenant.
See the [earlier section on pageserver startup](#pageserver-attachstartup-changes) for details.
Control plane can use this mechanism to clean up a pageserver that has been
down for so long that all its tenants were migrated away before it came back
up again and asked for re-attach.

### Failure of a pageserver

In this context, read "failure" as the most ambiguous possible case, where
a pageserver is unavailable to clients and control plane, but may still be executing and talking
to S3.

#### Case A: re-attachment to other nodes

1. Let's say node 0 becomes unresponsive in a cluster of three nodes 0, 1, 2.
2. Some external mechanism notices that the node is unavailable and initiates
   movement of all tenants attached to that node to a different node according
   to some distribution rule.
   In this example, it would mean incrementing the generation
   of all tenants that were attached to node 0, as each tenant's assigned pageserver changes.
3. A tenant which is now attached to node 1 will _also_ still be attached to node
   0, from the perspective of node 0. Node 0 will still be using its old generation,
   node 1 will be using a newer generation.
4. S3 writes will continue from nodes 0 and 1: there will be an index_part.json-00000001
   \_and\* an index_part.json-00000002. Objects written under the old suffix
   after the new attachment was created do not matter from the rest of the system's
   perspective: the endpoints are reading from the new attachment location. Objects
   written by node 0 are just garbage that can be cleaned up at leisure. Node 0 will
   not do any deletions because it can't synchronize with control plane, or if it could,
   its deletion queue processing would get errors for the validation requests.

#### Case B: direct node replacement with same node_id and drive

This is the scenario we would experience if running pageservers in some dynamic
VM/container environment that would auto-replace a given node_id when it became
unresponsive, with the node's storage supplied by some network block device
that is attached to the replacement VM/container.

1. Let's say node 0 fails, and there may be some other peers but they aren't relevant.
2. Some external mechanism notices that the node is unavailable, and creates
   a "new node 0" (Node 0b) which is a physically separate server. The original node 0
   (Node 0a) may still be running, because we do not assume the environment fences nodes.
3. On startup, node 0b re-attaches and gets higher generation numbers for
   all tenants.
4. S3 writes continue from nodes 0a and 0b, but the writes do not collide due to different
   generation in the suffix, and the writes from node 0a are not visible to the rest
   of the system because endpoints are reading only from node 0b.

# Appendix B: interoperability with other features

## Sharded Keyspace

The design in this RFC maps neatly to a sharded keyspace design where subsets of the key space
for a tenant are assigned to different pageservers:

- the "unit of work" for attachments becomes something like a TenantShard rather than a Tenant
- TenantShards get generation numbers just as Tenants do.
- Write workload (ingest, compaction) for a tenant is spread out across pageservers via
  TenantShards, but each TenantShard still has exactly one valid writer at a time.

## Read replicas

_This section is about a passive reader of S3 pageserver state, not a postgres
read replica_

For historical reads to LSNs below the remote persistent LSN, any node may act as a reader at any
time: remote data is logically immutable data, and the use of deferred deletion in this RFC helps
mitigate the fact that remote data is not _physically_ immutable (i.e. the actual data for a given
page moves around as compaction happens).

A read replica needs to be aware of generations in remote data in order to read the latest
metadata (find the index_part.json with the latest suffix). It may either query this
from the control plane, or find it with ListObjectsv2 request

## Seamless migration

To make tenant migration totally seamless, we will probably want to intentionally double-attach
a tenant briefly, serving reads from the old node while waiting for the new node to be ready.

This RFC enables that double-attachment: two nodes may be attached at the same time, with the migration destination
having a higher generation number. The old node will be able to ingest and serve reads, but not
do any deletes. The new node's attachment must also avoid deleting layers that the old node may
still use. A new piece of state
will be needed for this in the control plane's definition of an attachment.

## Warm secondary locations

To enable faster tenant movement after a pageserver is lost, we will probably want to spend some
disk capacity on keeping standby locations populated with local disk data.

There's no conflict between this RFC and that: implementing warm secondary locations on a per-tenant basis
would be a separate change to the control plane to store standby location(s) for a tenant. Because
the standbys do not write to S3, they do not need to be assigned generation numbers. When a tenant is
re-attached to a standby location, that would increment the tenant attachment generation and this
would work the same as any other attachment change, but with a warm cache.

## Ephemeral node IDs

This RFC intentionally avoids changing anything fundamental about how pageservers are identified
and registered with the control plane, to avoid coupling the implementation of pageserver split
brain protection with more fundamental changes in the management of the pageservers.

Moving to ephemeral node IDs would provide an extra layer of
resilience in the system, as it would prevent the control plane
accidentally attaching to two physical nodes with the same
generation, if somehow there were two physical nodes with
the same node IDs (currently we rely on EC2 guarantees to
eliminate this scenario). With ephemeral node IDs, there would be
no possibility of that happening, no matter the behavior of
underlying infrastructure.

Nothing fundamental in the pageserver's handling of generations needs to change to handle ephemeral node IDs, since we hardly use the
`node_id` anywhere. The `/re-attach` API would be extended
to enable the pageserver to obtain its ephemeral ID, and provide
some correlation identifier (e.g. EC instance ID), to help the
control plane re-attach tenants to the same physical server that
previously had them attached.

# Proposal: Pageserver MVCC S3 Storage

tl;dr: this proposal enables Control Plane to attach a tenant to a new pageserver without being 100% certain that it has been detached from the old pageserver. This enables us to automate failover if a pageserver dies (no human in the loop).

# Problem Statement

The current Neon architecture requires the Control Plane to guarantee that a tenant is only attached to one pageserver at a time. If a tenant is attached to multiple pageservers simultaneously, the pageservers will overwrite each other’s changes in S3 for that tenant, resulting in data loss for that tenant.

The above imposes limitations on tenant relocation and future designs for high availability. For instance, Control Plane cannot relocate a tenant to another pageserver before it is 100% certain that the tenant is detached from the source pageserver. If the source pageserver is unresponsive, the tenant detach procedure cannot proceed, and Control Plane has no choice but to wait for either the source to become responsive again, or rely on a node failure detection mechanism to detect that the source pageserver is dead, and give permission to skip the detachment step. Either way, the tenant is unavailable for an extended period, and we have no means to improve it in the current architecture.

Note that there is no 100% correct node failure detection mechanism, and even techniques to accelerate failure detection, such as ********************************shoot-the-other-node-in-the-head,******************************** have their limits. So, we currently rely on humans as node failure detectors: they get alerted via PagerDuty, assess the situation under high stress, and make the decision. If they make the wrong call, or the apparent dead pageserver somehow resurrects later, we’ll have data loss.

Also, by relying on humans, we’re [incurring needless unscalable toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/): as Neon grows, pageserver failures will become more and more frequent because our fleet grows. Each instance will need quick response time to minimize downtime for the affected tenants, which implies higher toil, higher resulting attrition, and/or higher personnel cost.

Lastly, there are foreseeable needs by operation and product such as zero-downtime relocation and automatic failover/HA. For such features, the ability to have a tenant purposefully or accidentally attached to more than one pageserver will greatly reduce risk of data loss, and improve availability.

# High-Level Idea

The core idea is to evolve the per-Tenant S3 state to an MVCC-like scheme, allowing multiple pageservers to operate on the same tenant S3 state without interference. To make changes to S3, pageservers acquire long-running transactions from Control Plane. After opening a transaction, Pageservers make PUTs directly against S3, but they keys include the transaction ID,  so overwrites never happen. Periodically, pageservers talk back to Control Plane to commit their transaction. This is where Control Plane enforces strict linearizability, favoring availability over work-conservation: commit is only granted if no transaction started after the one that’s requesting commit. Garbage collection is done through deadlists, and it’s simplified tremendously by above commit grant/reject policy.

Minimal changes are required for safekeepers to allow WAL for a single timeline be consumed by more than one pageserver without premature truncation.

**Above scheme makes it safe to attach tenants without a 100% correct node failure detection mechanism. Further, it makes it safe to interleave tenant-attachment to pageservers, unlocking new capabilities for (internal) product features:**

- **Fast, Zero-Toil Failover on Network Partitions or Instance Failure**: if a pageserver is not reachable (network partition, hardware failure, overload) we want to spread its attached tenants to new pageservers to restore availability, within the range of *seconds*. We cannot afford gracious timeouts to maximize the probability that the unreachable pageserver has ceased writing to S3. This proposal enables us to attach the tenants to the replacement pageservers,  and redirect their computes, without having to wait for confirmation that the unreachable pageserver has ceased writing to S3.
- **************************************Zero-Downtime Relocation:************************************** we want to be able to relocate tenants to different pageservers with minimized availability or a latency impact. This proposal enables us to attach the relocating Tenant to the destination Pageserver before detaching it from the source Pageserver. This can help minimize downtime because we can wait for the destination to catch up on WAL processing before redirecting Computes.

# Design

The core idea is to evolve the per-Tenant S3 state to a per-tenant MVCC-like scheme.

To make S3 changes for a given tenant, Pageserver requests a transaction ID from control plane for that tenant. Without a transaction ID, Pageserver does not write to S3.

Once Pageserver received a transaction ID it is allowed to produce new objects and overwrite objects created in this transaction. Pageserver is not allowed to delete any objects; instead, it marks the object as deleted by appending the key to the transaction’s deadlist for later deletion. Commits of transactions are serialized through Control Plane: when Pageserver wants to commit a transaction, it sends an RPC to Control Plane. Control Plane responds with a commit grant or commit reject message. Commit grant means that the transaction’s changes are now visible to subsequent transactions. Commit reject means that the transaction’s changes are not and never will be visible to another Pageserver instance, and the rejected Pageserver is to cease further activity on that tenant.

## ****************************************************Commit grant/reject policy****************************************************

For the purposes of Pageserver, we want **linearizability** of a tenant’s S3 state. Since our transactions are scoped per tenant, it is sufficient for linearizability to grant commit if and only if no other transaction has been started since the commit-requesting transaction started.

For example, consider the case of a single tenant, attached to Pageserver A. Pageserver A has an open transaction but becomes unresponsive. Control Plane decides to relocate the tenant to another Pageserver B. It need *not* wait for A to be 100%-certainly down before B can start uploading to S3 for that tenant. Instead, B can start a new transaction right away, make progress, and get commit grants;  What about A? The transaction is RejectPending in Control Plane until A eventually becomes responsive again, tries to commit, gets a rejection, acknowledges it, and thus its transaction becomes RejectAcknowledge. If A is definitively dead, operator can also force-transition from state RejectPending to RejectAcknowledged. But critically, Control Plane doesn’t have for A’s transaction to become RejectAcknowledge before attaching the tenant to B.

```

If a Pageserver gets a rejection to a commit request, it acknowledges rejection and cedes further S3 uploads for the tenant, until it receives a `/detach` request for the tenant (control plane has most likely attached the tenant to another pageserver in the meantime).

In practice, Control Plane will probably extend the commit grant/reject schema above, taking into account the pageserver to which it last attached the tenant. In the above example, Control Plane could remember that the pageserver that is supposed to host the tenant is pageserver B, and reject start-txn and commit requests from pageserver A. It would also use such requests from A as a signal that A is reachable again, and retry the `/detach` .

<aside>
💡 A commit failure causes the tenant to become effectively `Broken`. Pageserver should persist this locally so it doesn’t bother ControlPlane for a new txn when Pageserver is restarted.

</aside>

## ********************Visibility********************

We mentioned earlier that once a transaction commits, its changes are visible to subsequent transactions. But how does a given transaction know where to look for the data? There is no longer a single `index_part.json` per timeline, or a single `timelines/:timeline_id` prefix to look for; they’re all multi-versioned, suffixed by the txn number.
The solution is: at transaction start, Pageserver receives the last-committed transaction ID from Control Plane (`last_committed_txn` in the diagram). last_commited_txn is the upper bound for what is visible for the current transaction. Control Plane keeps track of each open transaction’s last_committed_txn for purposes of garbage collection (see later paragraph).
Equipped with last_committed_txn, Pageserver then discovers

- the current index part of a timeline at `tenants/:tenant_id/timelines/:timeline_id/index_part.json.$last_committed_txn`. The `index_part.json.$last_committed_txn` has the exact same contents as the current architecture’s index_part.json, i.e. full list of layers.
- the list of existent timelines as part of the `attach` RPC from CP;

There is no other S3 state per tenant, so, that’s all the visibility required.
An alternative to receiving the list of existent timelines from CP is to introduce a proper **********SetOfTimelines********** object in S3, and multi-version it just like above. For example, we could have a `tenants/:tenant_id/timelines.json.$txn` file that references `index_part.json.$last_committed_txn` . It can be added later if more separation between CP and PS is desired.

So, the only MVCC’ed object types in this proposal are LayerFile and IndexPart (=individual timeline), but not the SetOfTimelines in a given tenant. Is this a problem? For example, the Pageserver’s garbage collection code needs to know the full set of timelines of a tenant. Otherwise it’ll make incorrect decisions. What if Pageserver A knows about timelines {R,S}, but another Pageserver B created an additional branch T, so, its set of timelines is {R,S,T}. Both pageservers will run GC code, and so, PS A may decide to delete a layer that’s still needed for branch T. Not a problem with this propsoal, because the effect of GC (i.e., layer deletion) is properly MVCC’ed.

## Longevity Of Transactions & Availability

Pageserver depends on Control Plane to start a new transaction. If ControlPlane is down, no new transactions can be started.

Pageservers commit transactions based on a maximum amount of uncommitted changes that have accumulated in S3. A lower maximum increases dependence and load on ControlPlane which decreases availability. A higher maximum risks losing more work in the event of failover; the work will have to be re-done in a new transaction on the new node.

Pageservers are persist the open txn id in local storage, so that they can resume the transaction after restart, without dependence on Control Plane.

## **Operations**

********PUTs:********

- **layer files**
    - current architecture: layer files are supposed to be write-once, but actually, there are edge-cases where we PUT the same layer file name twice; namely if we PUT the file to S3 but crash before uploading the index part that references it; then detach + attach, and re-run compaction, which is non-deterministic.
    - this proposal: with transactions, we can now upload layers and index_part.json concurrently, just need to make sure layer file upload is done before we request txn commit.
- **index part** upload: `index_part.json.$txn` may be created and subsequently overwritten multiple times in a transaction; it is an availability/work-loss trade-off how often to request a commit from CP.

**************DELETEs**************: for deletion, we maintain a deadlist per transaction. It is located at `tenants/:tenant_id/deadlist/deadlist.json.$txn`. It is PUT once before the pageserver requests requests commit, and not changed after sending request to commit. An object created in the current txn need not (but can) be on the deadlist — it can be DELETEd immediately because it’s not visible to other transactions. An example use case would be an L0 layer that gets compacted within one transaction; or, if we ever start MVCC’ing the set of timelines of a tenant, a short-lived branch that is created & destroyed within one transaction.

<aside>
☝ **Deadlist Invariant:** if a an object is on a deadlist of transaction T, it is not referenced from anywhere else in the full state visible to T or any later started transaction > T.

</aside>

### Rationale For Deadlist.json

Given that this proposal only MVCC’s layers and indexparts, one may ask why the deadlist isn’t part of indexpart. The reason is to not lose generality: the deadlist is just a list of keys; it is not necessary to understand the data format of the versioned object to process the deadlist. This is important for garbage collection / vacuuming, which we’ll come to in the next section.

## Garbage Collection / Vacuuming

After a transaction has reached reject-acknowledged state,  Control Plane initiates a garbage collection procedure for the aborted transaction.

Control Plane is in the unique position about transaction states. Here is a sketch of the exact transaction states and what Control Plane keeps track of.

```
struct Tenant {
  ...

  txns: HashMap<TxnId, Transaction>,
  // the most recently started txn's id; only most recently started can win
  next_winner_txn: Option<TxnId>,
}
struct Transaction {
  id: TxnId, // immutable
  last_committed_txn: TxnId, // immutable; the most recent txn in state `Committed`
                             // when self was started
  pageserver_id: PageserverId,
  state: enum {
    Open,
    Committed,
    RejectPending,
    RejectAcknowledged, // invariant: we know all S3 activity has ceded
    GarbageCollected,
  }
}
```

Object creations & deletions by a rejected transaction have never been visible to other transactions. That is true for both RejectPending and RejectAcknowledged states. The difference is that, in RejectPending, the pageserver may still be uploading to S3, whereas in RejectAcknowledged, Control Plane can be certain that all S3 activity in the name of that transaction has ceded. So, once a transaction reaches state RejectAcknowledged state, it is safe to DELETE all objects created by that transaction, and discard the transaction’s deadlists.

A transaction T in state Committed has subsequent transactions that may or may not reference the objects it created. None of the subsequent transaction can reference the objects on T’s deadlist, though, as per the Deadlist Invariant (see previous section).

So, for garbage collection, we need to assess transactions in state Committed and RejectAcknowledged:

- Committed: delete objects on the deadlist.
    - We don’t need a LIST request here, the deadlist is sufficient. So, it’s really cheap.
    - This is **not true MVCC garbage collection**; by deleting the objects on Committed transaction T ’s deadlist, we might delete data referenced by other transactions that were concurrent with T, i.e., they started while T was still open. However, the fact that T is committed means that the other transactions are RejectPending or RejectAcknowledged, so, they don’t matter. Pageservers executing these doomed RejectPending transactions must handle 404 for GETs gracefully, e.g., by trying to commit txn so they observe the rejection they’re destined to get anyways. 404’s for RejectAcknowledged is handled below.
- RejectAcknowledged: delete all objects created in that txn, and discard deadlists.
    - 404s / object-already-deleted type messages must be expected because of Committed garbage collection (see above)
    - How to get this list of objects created in a txn? Open but solvable design question; Ideas:
        - **Brute force**: within tenant prefix, search for all keys ending in `.$txn` and delete them.
        - **WAL for PUTs**: before a txn PUTs an object, it logs to S3, or some other equivalently durable storage, that it’s going to do it. If we log to S3, this means we have to do an additional WAL PUT per “readl” PUT.
        - ******************************LIST with reorg’ed S3 layout (preferred one right now):****************************** layout S3 key space such that `$txn` comes first, i.e., `tenants/:tenant_id/$txn/timelines/:timeline_id/*.json.$txn` . That way, when we need to GC a RejectAcknowledged txn, we just LIST the entire `tenants/:tenant_id/$txn` prefix and delete it. The cost of GC for RejectAcknowledged transactions is thus proportional to the number of objects created in that transaction.

## Branches

This proposal only MVCC’s layer files and and index_part.json, but leaves the tenant object not-MVCCed. We argued earlier that it’s fine to ignore this for now, because

1. Control Plane can act as source-of-truth for the set of timelines, and
2. The only operation that makes decision based on “set of timelines” is GC, which in turn only does layer deletions, and layer deletions ***are*** properly MVCC’ed.

Now that we’ve introduced garbage collection, let’s elaborate a little more on (2). Recall our example from earlier: Pageserver A knows about timelines {R,S}, but another Pageserver B created an additional branch T, so, its set of timelines is {R,S,T}. Both pageservers will run GC code, and so, PS A may decide to delete a layer that’s still needed for branch T.

How does the MVCC’ing of layer files protect us here? If A decides to delete that layer, it’s just on A’s transaction’s deadlist, but still present in S3 and usable by B. If A commits first, B won’t be able to commit and the layers in timeline T will be vacuumed. If B commits first, A’s deadlist is discarded and the layer continues to exist.

## Safekeeper Changes

We need to teach the safekeepers that there can be multiple pageservers requesting WAL for the same timeline, in order to prevent premature WAL truncation.

In the current architecture, the Safekeeper service currently assumes only one Pageserver and is allowed to prune WAL older than that Pageserver’s `remote_consistent_lsn`. Safekeeper currently learns the `remote_consistent_lsn` through the walreceiver protocol.

So, if we have a tenant attached to two pageservers at the same time, they will both try to stream WAL and the Safekeeper will get confused about which connection’s `remote_consistent_lsn` to use as a basis for WAL pruning.

What do we need to change to make it work? We need to make sure that the Safekeepers only prune WAL up to the `remote_consistent_lsn` of the last-committed transaction.

The straight-forward way to get it is to re-design WAL pruning as follows:

1. Pageserver reports remote_consistent_lsn as part of transaction commit to Control Plane.
2. Control Plane makes sure transaction state update is persisted.
3. Control Plane (asynchronous to transaction commit) reconciles with Safekeepers to ensure WAL pruning happens.

The above requires non-trivial changes, but, in the light of other planned projects such as restore-tenant-from-safekeeper-wal-backups, I think Control Plane will need to get involved in WAL pruning anyways.

# How This Proposal Unlocks Future Features

Let us revisit the example from the introduction where we were thinking about handling network partitions. Network partitions need to be solved first, because they’re unavoidable in distributed systems. We did that. Now let’s see how we can solve actual product problems:

## **Fast, Zero-Toil Failover on Network Partitions or Instance Failure**

The “Problem Statement” section outlined the current architecture’s problems with regards to network partitions or instance failure: it requires a 100% correct node-dead detector to make decisions, which doesn’t exist in reality. We rely instead on human toil: an oncall engineer has to inspect the situation and make a decision, which may be incorrect and in any case take time in the order of minutes, which means equivalent downtime for users.

With this proposal, automatic failover for pageservers is trivial:

If a pageserver is unresponsive from Control Plane’s / Compute’s perspective, Control Plane does the following:

- attach all tenants of the unresponsive pageserver to new pageservers
- switch over these tenants’ computes immediately;

At this point, availability is restored and user pain relieved.

What’s left is to somehow close the doomed transaction of the unresponsive pageserver, so that it becomes RejectAcknowledged, and GC can make progress. Since S3 is cheap, we can afford to wait a really long time here, especially if we put a soft bound on the amount of data a transaction may produce before it must commit. Procedure:

1. Ensure the unresponsive pageserver is taken out of rotation for new attachments. That probably should happen as part of the routine above.
2. Make a human operator investigate decide what to do (next morning, NO ONCALL ALERT):
    1. Inspect the instance, investigate logs, understand root cause.
    2. Try to re-establish connectivity between pageserver and Control Plane so that pageserver can retry commits, get rejected, ack rejection ⇒ enable GC.
    3. Use below procedure to decommission pageserver.

### Decommissioning A Pageserver (Dead or Alive-but-Unresponsive)

The solution, enabled by this proposal:

1. Ensure that pageserver’s S3 credentials are revoked so that it cannot make new uploads, which wouldn’t be tracked anywhere.
2. Let enough time pass for the S3 credential revocation to propagate. Amazon doesn’t give a guarantee here. As stated earlier, we can easily afford to wait here.
3. Mark all Open and RejectPending transactions of that pageserver as RejectAcknowledge.

Revocation of the S3 credentials is required so that, once we transition all the transactions of that pageserver to RejectAcknowledge, once garbage-collection pass is guaranteed to delete all objects that will ever exist for that pageserver. That way, we need not check *****GarbageCollected***** transactions every again.

## Workflow: Zero-Downtime Relocation

With zero-downtime relocation, the goal is to have the target pageserver warmed up, i.e., at the same `last_record_lsn` as the source pageserver, before switching over Computes from source to target pageserver.

With this proposal, it works like so:

1. Grant source pageserver its last open transaction. This one is doomed to be rejected later, unless the relocation fails.
2. Grant target pageserver its first open transaction.
3. Have target pageserver catch up on WAL, streaming from last-committed-txn’s remote_consistent_lsn onwards.
4. Once target pageserver reports `last_record_lsn` close enough to source pageserver, target pageserver requests commit.
5. Drain compute traffic from source to target pageserver. (Source can still answer requests until it tries to commit and gets reject, so, this will be quite smooth).

Note that as soon as we complete step (4), the source pageserver’s transaction is doomed to be rejected later. Conversely, if the target can’t catch up fast enough, the source will make a transaction commit earlier. This will generally happen if there is a lot of write traffic coming in. The design space to make thing smooth here is large, but well explored in other areas of computing, e.g., VM live migration. We have all the important policy levers at hand, e.g.,

- delaying source commits if we see target making progress
- slowing down source consumption (need some signalling mechanism for it)
- slowing down compute wal generation
- …

It doesn’t really matter, what’s important is that two pageservers can overlap.

# Additional Trade-Offs / Remarks Brought Up During Peer Review

This proposal was read by and discussed @Stas and @Dmitry Rodionov prior to publishing it with the broader team. (This does not mean they endorse this proposal!).

Issues that we discussed:

1. **Frequency of transactions:** If even idle tenants commit every 10min or so, that’s quite a lot of load on Control Plane. Can we minimize it by Equating Transaction Commit Period to Attachment Period? I.e. start txn on attach, commit on detach?
    1. Would be nice, but, if a tenant is attached for 1 month, then PS dies, we lose 1 month of work.
    2. ⇒ my solution to this problem: Adjusted this proposal to make transaction commit frequency proportional to amount of uncommitted data.
        1. It’s ok to spend resources on active users, they pay us money to do it!
        2. The amount of work per transaction is minimal.
            1. In current Control Plane, it’s a small database transaction that is super unlikely to conflict with other transactions.
            2. I have very little concerns about scalability of the commit workload on CP side because it's trivially horizontally scalable by sharding by tenant.
        3. There's no super stringent availability requirement on control plane; if a txn can't commit because it can't reach the CP, PS can continue & retry in the background, speculating that it's CP downtime and not PS-partitioned-off scenario.
        4. Without stringent availability requirement, there's flexibility for future changes to CP-side-implementation.
2. ************************************************Does this proposal address mirroring / no-performance-degradation failover ?************************************************
    1. No it doesn’t. It only provides the building block for attaching a tenant to a new pageserver without having to worry that the tenant is detached on the old pageserver.
    2. A simple scheme to build no-performance-degradation failover on top of this proposal is to have an asynchronous read-only replica of a tenant on another pageserver in the same region.
    3. Another more ambitious scheme to get no-performance-degradation would be [One-Pager: Layer File Spreading (Christian)](https://www.notion.so/One-Pager-Layer-File-Spreading-Christian-eb6b64182a214e11b3fceceee688d843?pvs=21); this proposal would be used in layer file spreading for risk-free automation of TenantLeader failover, which hasn’t been addressed Ithere.
    4. In any way, failover would restart from an older S3 state, and need to re-ingest WAL before being able to server recently written pages.
        1. Is that a show-stopper? I think not.
        2. Is it suboptimal? Absolutely: if a pageserver instance fails, all its tenants will be distributed among the remaining pageservers (OK), and all these tenants will ask the safekeepers for WAL at the same time (BAD). So, pageserver instance failure will cause a load spike in safekeepers.
            1. Personally I think that’s an OK trade-off to make.
            2. There are countless options to avoid / mitigate the load spike. E.g., pro-actively streaming WAL to the standby read-only replica.

# Crash-Consistent Layer Map Updates By Leveraging `index_part.json`

* Created on: Aug 23, 2023
* Author: Christian Schwarz

## Summary

This RFC describes a simple scheme to make layer map updates crash consistent by leveraging the `index_part.json` in remote storage.
Without such a mechanism, crashes can induce certain edge cases in which broadly held assumptions about system invariants don't hold.

## Motivation

### Background

We can currently easily make complex, atomic updates to the layer map by means of an RwLock.
If we crash or restart pageserver, we reconstruct the layer map from:
1. local timeline directory contents
2. remote `index_part.json` contents.

The function that is responsible for this is called `Timeline::load_layer_map()`.
The reconciliation process's behavior is the following:
* local-only files will become part of the layer map as local-only layers and rescheduled for upload
* For a file name that, by its name, is present locally and in the remote `index_part.json`, but where the local file has a different size (future: checksum) than the remote file, we will delete the local file and leave the remote file as a `RemoteLayer` in the layer map.

### The Problem

There are are cases where we need to make an atomic update to the layer map that involves **more than one layer**.
The best example is compaction, where we need to insert the L1 layers generated from the L0 layers, and remove the L0 layers.
As stated above, making the update to the layer map in atomic way is trivial.
But, there is no system call API to make an atomic update to a directory that involves more than one file rename and deletion.
Currently, we issue the system calls one by one and hope we don't crash.

What happens if we crash and restart in the middle of that system call sequence?
We will reconstruct the layer map according to the reconciliation process, taking as input whatever transitory state the timeline directory ended up in.

We cannot roll back or complete the timeline directory update during which we crashed, because we keep no record of the changes we plan to make.

### Problem's Implications For Compaction

The implications of the above are primarily problematic for compaction.
Specifically, the part of it that compacts L0 layers into L1 layers.

Remember that compaction takes a set of L0 layers and reshuffles the delta records in them into L1 layer files.
Once the L1 layer files are written to disk, it atomically removes the L0 layers from the layer map and adds the L1 layers to the layer map.
It then deletes the L0 layers locally, and schedules an upload of the L1 layers and and updated index part.

If we crash before deleting L0s, but after writing out L1s, the next compaction after restart will re-digest the L0s and produce new L1s.
This means the compaction after restart will **overwrite** the previously written L1s.
Currently we also schedule an S3 upload of the overwritten L1.

If the compaction algorithm doesn't change between the two compaction runs, is deterministic, and uses the same set of L0s as input, then the second run will produce identical L1s and the overwrites will go unnoticed.

*However*:
1. the file size of the overwritten L1s may not be identical, and
2. the bit pattern of the overwritten L1s may not be identical, and,
3. in the future, we may want to make the compaction code non-deterministic, influenced by past access patterns, or otherwise change it, resulting in L1 overwrites with a different set of delta records than before the overwrite

The items above are a problem for the [split-brain protection RFC](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/4919) because it assumes that layer files in S3 are only ever deleted, but never replaced (overPUTted).

For example, if an unresponsive node A becomes active again after control plane has relocated the tenant to a new node B, the node A may overwrite some L1s.
But node B based its world view on the version of node A's `index_part.json` from _before_ the overwrite.
That earlier `index_part.json`` contained the file size of the pre-overwrite L1.
If the overwritten L1 has a different file size, node B will refuse to read data from the overwritten L1.
Effectively, the data in the L1 has become inaccessible to node B.
If node B already uploaded an index part itself, all subsequent attachments will use node B's index part, and run into the same problem.

If we ever introduce checksums instead of checking just the file size, then a mismatching bit pattern (2) will cause similar problems.

In case of (1) and (2), where we know that the logical content of the layers is still the same, we can recover by manually patching the `index_part.json` of the new node to the overwritten L1's file size / checksum.

But if (3) ever happens, the logical content may be different, and, we could have truly lost data.

Given the above considerations, we should avoid making correctness of split-brain protection dependent on overwrites preserving _logical_ layer file contents.
**It is a much cleaner separation of concerns to require that layer files are truly immutable in S3, i.e., PUT once and then only DELETEd, never overwritten (overPUTted).**

## Design

Instead of reconciling a layer map from local timeline directory contents and remote index part, this RFC proposes to view the remote index part as authoritative during timeline load.
Local layer files will be recognized if they match what's listed in remote index part, and removed otherwise.

During **timeline load**, the only thing that matters is the remote index part content.
Essentially, timeline load becomes much like attach, except we don't need to prefix-list the remote timelines.
The local timeline dir's `metadata` file does not matter.
The layer files in the local timeline dir are seen as a nice-to-have cache of layer files that are in the remote index part.
Any layer files in the local timeline dir that aren't in the remote index part are removed during startup.
The `Timeline::load_layer_map()` no longer "merges" local timeline dir contents with the remote index part.
Instead, it treats the remote index part as the authoritative layer map.
If the local timeline dir contains a layer that is in the remote index part, that's nice, and we'll re-use it if file size (and in the future, check sum) match what's stated in the index part.
If it doesn't match, we remove the file from the local timeline dir.

After load, **at runtime**, nothing changes compared to what we did before this RFC.
The procedure for single- and multi-object changes is reproduced here for reference:
* For any new layers that the change adds:
  * Write them to a temporary location.
  * While holding layer map lock:
    * Move them to the final location.
    * Insert into layer map.
* Make the S3 changes.
  We won't reproduce the remote timeline client method calls here because these are subject to change.
  Instead we reproduce the sequence of s3 changes that must result for a given single-/multi-object change:
    * PUT layer files inserted by the change.
    * PUT an index part that has insertions and deletions of the change.
    * DELETE the layer files that are deleted by the change.

Note that it is safe for the DELETE to be deferred arbitrarily.
* If it never happens, we leak the object, but, that's not a correctness concern.
* As of #4938, we don't schedule the remote timeline client operation for deletion immediately, but, only when we drop the `LayerInner`.
* With the [split-brain protection RFC](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/4919), the deletions will be written to deletion queue for processing when it's safe to do so (see the RFC for details).

## How This Solves The Problem

If we crash before we've finished the S3 changes, then timeline load will reset layer map to the state that's in the S3 index part.
The S3 change sequence above is obviously crash-consistent.
If we crash before the index part PUT, then we leak the inserted layer files to S3.
If we crash after the index part PUT, we leak the to-be-DELETEd layer files to S3.
Leaking is fine, it's a pre-existing condition and not addressed in this RFC.

Multi-object changes that previously created and removed files in timeline dir are now atomic because the layer map updates are atomic and crash consistent:
* atomic layer map update at runtime, currently by using an RwLock in write mode
* atomic `index_part.json` update in S3, as per guarantee that S3 PUT is atomic
* local timeline dir state:
  * irrelevant for layer map content => irrelevant for atomic updates / crash consistency
  * if we crash after index part PUT, local layer files will be used, so, no on-demand downloads needed for them
  * if we crash before index part PUT, local layer files will be deleted

## Trade-Offs

### Fundamental

If we crash before finishing the index part PUT, we lose all the work that hasn't reached the S3 `index_part.json`:
* wal ingest: we lose not-yet-uploaded L0s; load on the **safekeepers** + work for pageserver
* compaction: we lose the entire compaction iteration work; need to re-do it again
* gc: no change to what we have today

If the work is still deemed necessary after restart, the restarted restarted pageserver will re-do this work.
The amount of work to be re-do is capped to the lag of S3 changes to the local changes.
Assuming upload queue allows for unlimited queue depth (that's what it does today), this means:
* on-demand downloads that were needed to do the work: are likely still present, not lost
* wal ingest: currently unbounded
* L0 => L1 compaction: CPU time proportional to `O(sum(L0 size))` and upload work proportional to `O()`
  * Compaction threshold is 10 L0s and each L0 can be up to 256M in size. Target size for L1 is 128M.
  * In practice, most L0s are tiny due to 10minute `DEFAULT_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT`.
* image layer generation: CPU time `O(sum(input data))` + upload work `O(sum(new image layer size))`
  * I have no intuition how expensive / long-running it is in reality.
* gc: `update_gc_info`` work (not substantial, AFAIK)

To limit the amount of lost upload work, and ingest work, we can limit the upload queue depth (see suggestions in the next sub-section).
However, to limit the amount of lost CPU work, we would need a way to make make the compaction/image-layer-generation algorithms interruptible & resumable.
We aren't there yet, the need for it is tracked by ([#4580](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/4580)).
However, this RFC is not constraining the design space either.

### Practical

#### Pageserver Restarts

Pageserver crashes are very rare ; it would likely be acceptable to re-do the lost work in that case.
However, regular pageserver restart happen frequently, e.g., during weekly deploys.

In general, pageserver restart faces the problem of tenants that "take too long" to shut down.
They are a problem because other tenants that shut down quickly are unavailable while we wait for the slow tenants to shut down.
We currently allot 10 seconds for graceful shutdown until we SIGKILL the pageserver process (as per `pageserver.service` unit file).
A longer budget would expose tenants that are done early to a longer downtime.
A short budget would risk throwing away more work that'd have to be re-done after restart.

In the context of this RFC, killing the process would mean losing the work that hasn't made it to S3.
We can mitigate this problem as follows:
0. initially, by accepting that we need to do the work again
1. short-term, introducing measures to cap the amount of in-flight work:

   - cap upload queue length, use backpressure to slow down compaction
   - disabling compaction/image-layer-generation X minutes before `systemctl restart pageserver`
   - introducing a read-only shutdown state for tenants that are fast to shut down;
     that state would be equivalent to the state of a tenant in hot standby / readonly mode.

2. mid term, by not restarting pageserver in place, but using [*seamless tenant migration*](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/5029) to drain a pageserver's tenants before we restart it.

#### `disk_consistent_lsn` can go backwards

`disk_consistent_lsn` can go backwards across restarts if we crash before we've finished the index part PUT.
Nobody should care about it, because the only thing that matters is `remote_consistent_lsn`.
Compute certainly doesn't care about `disk_consistent_lsn`.


## Side-Effects Of This Design

* local `metadata` is basically reduced to a cache of which timelines exist for this tenant; i.e., we can avoid a `ListObjects` requests for a tenant's timelines during tenant load.

## Limitations

Multi-object changes that span multiple timelines aren't covered by this RFC.
That's fine because we currently don't need them, as evidenced by the absence
of a Pageserver operation that holds multiple timelines' layer map lock at a time.

## Impacted components

Primarily pageservers.

Safekeepers will experience more load when we need to re-ingest WAL because we've thrown away work.
No changes to safekeepers are needed.

## Alternatives considered

### Alternative 1: WAL

We could have a local WAL for timeline dir changes, as proposed here https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/4418 and partially implemented here https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/4422 .
The WAL would be used to
1. make multi-object changes atomic
2. replace `reconcile_with_remote()` reconciliation: scheduling of layer upload would be part of WAL replay.

The WAL is appealing in a local-first world, but, it's much more complex than the design described above:
* New on-disk state to get right.
* Forward- and backward-compatibility development costs in the future.

### Alternative 2: Flow Everything Through `index_part.json`

We could have gone to the other extreme and **only** update the layer map whenever we've PUT `index_part.json`.
I.e., layer map would always be the last-persisted S3 state.
That's axiomatically beautiful, not least because it fully separates the layer file production and consumption path (=> [layer file spreading proposal](https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/One-Pager-Layer-File-Spreading-Christian-eb6b64182a214e11b3fceceee688d843?pvs=4)).
And it might make hot standbys / read-only pageservers less of a special case in the future.

But, I have some uncertainties with regard to WAL ingestion, because it needs to be able to do some reads for the logical size feedback to safekeepers.

And it's silly that we wouldn't be able to use the results of compaction or image layer generation before we're done with the upload.

Lastly, a temporarily clogged-up upload queue (e.g. S3 is down) shouldn't immediately render ingestion unavailable.

### Alternative 3: Sequence Numbers For Layers

Instead of what's proposed in this RFC, we could use unique numbers to identify layer files:

```
# before
tenants/$tenant/timelines/$timeline/$key_and_lsn_range
# after
tenants/$tenant/timelines/$timeline/$layer_file_id-$key_and_lsn_range
```

To guarantee uniqueness, the unique number is a sequence number, stored in `index_part.json`.

This alternative does not solve atomic layer map updates.
In our crash-during-compaction scenario above, the compaction run after the crash will not overwrite the L1s, but write/PUT new files with new sequence numbers.
In fact, this alternative makes it worse because the data is now duplicated in the not-overwritten and overwritten L1 layer files.
We'd need to write a deduplication pass that checks if perfectly overlapping layers have identical contents.

However, this alternative is appealing because it systematically prevents overwrites at a lower level than this RFC.

So, this alternative is sufficient for the needs of the split-brain safety RFC (immutable layer files locally and in S3).
But it doesn't solve the problems with crash-during-compaction outlined earlier in this RFC, and in fact, makes it much more acute.
The proposed design in this RFC addresses both.

So, if this alternative sounds appealing, we should implement the proposal in this RFC first, then implement this alternative on top.
That way, we avoid a phase where the crash-during-compaction problem is acute.

## Implementation Plan

1. Remove support for `remote_storage=None`, because we now rely on the existence of an index part.

    - The nasty part here is to fix all the tests that fiddle with the local timeline directory.
      Possibly they are just irrelevant with this change, but, each case will require inspection.

2. Implement the design above.

    - Initially, ship without the mitigations for restart and accept we will do some work twice.
    - Measure the impact and implement one of the mitigations.



# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/028-pageserver-migration.md:

# Seamless tenant migration

- Author: john@neon.tech
- Created on 2023-08-11
- Implemented on ..

## Summary

The preceding [generation numbers RFC](025-generation-numbers.md) may be thought of as "making tenant
migration safe". Following that,
this RFC is about how those migrations are to be done:

1. Seamlessly (without interruption to client availability)
2. Quickly (enabling faster operations)
3. Efficiently (minimizing I/O and $ cost)

These points are in priority order: if we have to sacrifice
efficiency to make a migration seamless for clients, we will
do so, etc.

This is accomplished by introducing two high level changes:

- A dual-attached state for tenants, used in a control-plane-orchestrated
  migration procedure that preserves availability during a migration.
- Warm secondary locations for tenants, where on-disk content is primed
  for a fast migration of the tenant from its current attachment to this
  secondary location.

## Motivation

Migrating tenants between pageservers is essential to operating a service
at scale, in several contexts:

1. Responding to a pageserver node failure by migrating tenants to other pageservers
2. Balancing load and capacity across pageservers, for example when a user expands their
   database and they need to migrate to a pageserver with more capacity.
3. Restarting pageservers for upgrades and maintenance

The current situation steps for migration are:

- detach from old node; skip if old node is dead; (the [skip part is still WIP](https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/issues/5426)).
- attach to new node
- re-configure endpoints to use the new node

Once [generation numbers](025-generation-numbers.md) are implemented,
the detach step is no longer critical for correctness. So, we can

- attach to a new node,
- re-configure endpoints to use the new node, and then
- detach from the old node.

However, this still does not meet our seamless/fast/efficient goals:

- Not fast: The new node will have to download potentially large amounts
  of data from S3, which may take many minutes.
- Not seamless: If we attach to a new pageserver before detaching an old one,
  the new one might delete some objects that interrupt availability of reads on the old one.
- Not efficient: the old pageserver will continue uploading
  S3 content during the migration that will never be read.

The user expectations for availability are:

- For planned maintenance, there should be zero availability
  gap. This expectation is fulfilled by this RFC.
- For unplanned changes (e.g. node failures), there should be
  minimal availability gap. This RFC provides the _mechanism_
  to fail over quickly, but does not provide the failure _detection_
  nor failover _policy_.

## Non Goals

- Defining service tiers with different storage strategies: the same
  level of HA & overhead will apply to all tenants. This doesn't rule out
  adding such tiers in future.
- Enabling pageserver failover in the absence of a control plane: the control
  plane will remain the source of truth for what should be attached where.
- Totally avoiding availability gaps on unplanned migrations during
  a failure (we expect a small, bounded window of
  read unavailability of very recent LSNs)
- Workload balancing: this RFC defines the mechanism for moving tenants
  around, not the higher level logic for deciding who goes where.
- Defining all possible configuration flows for tenants: the migration process
  defined in this RFC demonstrates the sufficiency of the pageserver API, but
  is not the only kind of configuration change the control plane will ever do.
  The APIs defined here should let the control plane move tenants around in
  whatever way is needed while preserving data safety and read availability.

## Impacted components

Pageserver, control plane

## Terminology

- **Attachment**: a tenant is _attached_ to a pageserver if it has
  been issued a generation number, and is running an instance of
  the `Tenant` type, ingesting the WAL, and available to serve
  page reads.
- **Location**: locations are a superset of attachments. A location
  is a combination of a tenant and a pageserver. We may _attach_ at a _location_.

- **Secondary location**: a location which is not currently attached.
- **Warm secondary location**: a location which is not currently attached, but is endeavoring to maintain a warm local cache of layers. We avoid calling this a _warm standby_ to avoid confusion with similar postgres features.

## Implementation (high level)

### Warm secondary locations

To enable faster migrations, we will identify at least one _secondary location_
for each tenant. This secondary location will keep a warm cache of layers
for the tenant, so that if it is later attached, it can catch up with the
latest LSN quickly: rather than downloading everything, it only has to replay
the recent part of the WAL to advance from the remote_consistent_offset to the
most recent LSN in the WAL.

The control plane is responsible for selecting secondary locations, and
calling into pageservers to configure tenants into a secondary mode at this
new location, as well as attaching the tenant in its existing primary location.

The attached pageserver for a tenant will publish a [layer heatmap](#layer-heatmap)
to advise secondaries of which layers should be downloaded.

### Location modes

Currently, we consider a tenant to be in one of two states on a pageserver:

- Attached: active `Tenant` object, and layers on local disk
- Detached: no layers on local disk, no runtime state.

We will extend this with finer-grained modes, whose purpose will become
clear in later sections:

- **AttachedSingle**: equivalent the existing attached state.
- **AttachedMulti**: like AttachedSingle, holds an up to date generation, but
  does not do deletions.
- **AttachedStale**: like AttachedSingle, holds a stale generation,
  do not do any remote storage operations.
- **Secondary**: keep local state on disk, periodically update from S3.
- **Detached**: equivalent to existing detached state.

To control these finer grained states, a new pageserver API endpoint will be added.

### Cutover procedure

Define old location and new location as "Node A" and "Node B". Consider
the case where both nodes are available, and Node B was previously configured
as a secondary location for the tenant we are migrating.

The cutover procedure is orchestrated by the control plane, calling into
the pageservers' APIs:

1. Call to Node A requesting it to flush to S3 and enter AttachedStale state
2. Increment generation, and call to Node B requesting it to enter AttachedMulti
   state with the new generation.
3. Call to Node B, requesting it to download the latest hot layers from remote storage,
   according to the latest heatmap flushed by Node A.
4. Wait for Node B's WAL ingestion to catch up with node A's
5. Update endpoints to use node B instead of node A
6. Call to node B requesting it to enter state AttachedSingle.
7. Call to node A requesting it to enter state Secondary

The following table summarizes how the state of the system advances:

|     Step      |     Node A     |     Node B     | Node used by endpoints |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :------------: | :--------------------: |
| 1 (_initial_) | AttachedSingle |   Secondary    |           A            |
|       2       | AttachedStale  | AttachedMulti  |           A            |
|       3       | AttachedStale  | AttachedMulti  |           A            |
|       4       | AttachedStale  | AttachedMulti  |           A            |
| 5 (_cutover_) | AttachedStale  | AttachedMulti  |           B            |
|       6       | AttachedStale  | AttachedSingle |           B            |
|  7 (_final_)  |   Secondary    | AttachedSingle |           B            |

The procedure described for a clean handover from a live node to a secondary
is also used for failure cases and for migrations to a location that is not
configured as a secondary, by simply skipping irrelevant steps, as described in
the following sections.

#### Migration from an unresponsive node

If node A is unavailable, then all calls into
node A are skipped and we don't wait for B to catch up before
switching updating the endpoints to use B.

#### Migration to a location that is not a secondary

If node B is initially in Detached state, the procedure is identical. Since Node B
is coming from a Detached state rather than Secondary, the download of layers and
catch up with WAL will take much longer.

We might do this if:

- Attached and secondary locations are both critically low on disk, and we need
  to migrate to a third node with more resources available.
- We are migrating a tenant which does not use secondary locations to save on cost.

#### Permanent migration away from a node

In the final step of the migration, we generally request the original node to enter a Secondary
state. This is typical if we are doing a planned migration during maintenance, or to
balance CPU/network load away from a node.

One might also want to permanently migrate away: this can be done by simply removing the secondary
location after the migration is complete, or as an optimization by substituting the Detached state
for the Secondary state in the final step.

## Implementation (detail)

### Purpose of AttachedMulti, AttachedStale

#### AttachedMulti

Ordinarily, an attached pageserver whose generation is the latest may delete
layers at will (e.g. during compaction). If a previous generation pageserver
is also still attached, and in use by endpoints, then this layer deletion could
lead to a loss of availability for the endpoint when reading from the previous
generation pageserver.

The _AttachedMulti_ state simply disables deletions. These will be enqueued
in `RemoteTimelineClient` until the control plane transitions the
node into AttachedSingle, which unblocks deletions.  Other remote storage operations
such as uploads are not blocked.

AttachedMulti is not required for data safety, only to preserve availability
on pageservers running with stale generations.

A node enters AttachedMulti only when explicitly asked to by the control plane. It should
only remain in this state for the duration of a migration.

If a control plane bug leaves
the node in AttachedMulti for a long time, then we must avoid unbounded memory use from enqueued
deletions. This may be accomplished simply, by dropping enqueued deletions when some modest
threshold of delayed deletions (e.g. 10k layers per tenant) is reached. As with all deletions,
it is safe to skip them, and the leaked objects will be eventually cleaned up by scrub or
by timeline deletion.

During AttachedMulti, the Tenant is free to drop layers from local disk in response to
disk pressure: only the deletion of remote layers is blocked.

#### AttachedStale

Currently, a pageserver with a stale generation number will continue to
upload layers, but be prevented from completing deletions. This is safe, but inefficient: layers uploaded by this stale generation
will not be read back by future generations of pageservers.

The _AttachedStale_ state disables S3 uploads. The stale pageserver
will continue to ingest the WAL and write layers to local disk, but not to
do any uploads to S3.

A node may enter AttachedStale in two ways:

- Explicitly, when control plane calls into the node at the start of a migration.
- Implicitly, when the node tries to validate some deletions and discovers
  that its generation is stale.

The AttachedStale state also disables sending consumption metrics from
that location: it is interpreted as an indication that some other pageserver
is already attached or is about to be attached, and that new pageserver will
be responsible for sending consumption metrics.

#### Disk Pressure & AttachedStale

Over long periods of time, a tenant location in AttachedStale will accumulate data
on local disk, as it cannot evict any layers written since it entered the
AttachStale state. We rely on the control plane to revert the location to
Secondary or Detached at the end of a migration.

This scenario is particularly noteworthy when evacuating all tenants on a pageserver:
since _all_ the attached tenants will go into AttachedStale, we will be doing no
uploads at all, therefore ingested data will cause disk usage to increase continuously.
Under nominal conditions, the available disk space on pageservers should be sufficient
to complete the evacuation before this becomes a problem, but we must also handle
the case where we hit a low disk situation while in this state.

The concept of disk pressure already exists in the pageserver: the `disk_usage_eviction_task`
touches each Tenant when it determines that a low-disk condition requires
some layer eviction. Having selected layers for eviction, the eviction
task calls `Timeline::evict_layers`.

**Safety**: If evict_layers is called while in AttachedStale state, and some of the to-be-evicted
layers are not yet uploaded to S3, then the block on uploads will be lifted. This
will result in leaking some objects once a migration is complete, but will enable
the node to manage its disk space properly: if a node is left with some tenants
in AttachedStale indefinitely due to a network partition or control plane bug,
these tenants will not cause a full disk condition.

### Warm secondary updates

#### Layer heatmap

The secondary location's job is to serve reads **with the same quality of service as the original location
was serving them around the time of a migration**. This does not mean the secondary
location needs the whole set of layers: inactive layers that might soon
be evicted on the attached pageserver need not be downloaded by the
secondary. A totally idle tenant only needs to maintain enough on-disk
state to enable a fast cold start (i.e. the most recent image layers are
typically sufficient).

To enable this, we introduce the concept of a _layer heatmap_, which
acts as an advisory input to secondary locations to decide which
layers to download from S3.

#### Attached pageserver

The attached pageserver, if in state AttachedSingle, periodically
uploads a serialized heat map to S3. It may skip this if there
is no change since the last time it uploaded (e.g. if the tenant
is totally idle).

Additionally, when the tenant is flushed to remote storage prior to a migration
(the first step in [cutover procedure](#cutover-procedure)), 
the heatmap is written out. This enables a future attached pageserver
to get an up to date view when deciding which layers to download.

#### Secondary location behavior

Secondary warm locations run a simple loop, implemented separately from
the main `Tenant` type, which represents attached tenants:

- Download the layer heatmap
- Select any "hot enough" layers to download, if there is sufficient
  free disk space.
- Download layers, if they were not previously evicted (see below)
- Download the latest index_part.json
- Check if any layers currently on disk are no longer referenced by
  IndexPart & delete them

Note that the heatmap is only advisory: if a secondary location has plenty
of disk space, it may choose to retain layers that aren't referenced
by the heatmap, as long as they are still referenced by the IndexPart. Conversely,
if a node is very low on disk space, it might opt to raise the heat threshold required
to both downloading a layer, until more disk space is available.

#### Secondary locations & disk pressure

Secondary locations are subject to eviction on disk pressure, just as
attached locations are.  For eviction purposes, the access time of a
layer in a secondary location will be the access time given in the heatmap,
rather than the literal time at which the local layer file was accessed.

The heatmap will indicate which layers are in local storage on the attached
location.  The secondary will always attempt to get back to having that
set of layers on disk, but to avoid flapping, it will remember the access
time of the layer it was most recently asked to evict, and layers whose
access time is below that will not be re-downloaded.

The resulting behavior is that after a layer is evicted from a secondary
location, it is only re-downloaded once the attached pageserver accesses
the layer and uploads a heatmap reflecting that access time.  On a pageserver
restart, the secondary location will attempt to download all layers in
the heatmap again, if they are not on local disk.

This behavior will be slightly different when secondary locations are
used for "low energy tenants", but that is beyond the scope of this RFC.

### Location configuration API

Currently, the `/tenant/<tenant_id>/config` API defines various
tunables like compaction settings, which apply to the tenant irrespective
of which pageserver it is running on.

A new "location config" structure will be introduced, which defines
configuration which is per-tenant, but local to a particular pageserver,
such as the attachment mode and whether it is a secondary.

The pageserver will expose a new per-tenant API for setting
the state: `/tenant/<tenant_id>/location/config`.

Body content:

```
{
  state: 'enum{Detached, Secondary, AttachedSingle, AttachedMulti, AttachedStale}',
  generation: Option<u32>,
  configuration: `Option<TenantConfig>`
  flush: bool
}
```

Existing `/attach` and `/detach` endpoint will have the same
behavior as calling `/location/config` with `AttachedSingle` and `Detached`
states respectively. These endpoints will be deprecated and later
removed.

The generation attribute is mandatory for entering `AttachedSingle` or
`AttachedMulti`.

The configuration attribute is mandatory when entering any state other
than `Detached`. This configuration is the same as the body for
the existing `/tenant/<tenant_id>/config` endpoint.

The `flush` argument indicates whether the pageservers should flush
to S3 before proceeding: this only has any effect if the node is
currently in AttachedSingle or AttachedMulti. This is used
during the first phase of migration, when transitioning the
old pageserver to AttachedSingle.

The `/re-attach` API response will be extended to include a `state` as
well as a `generation`, enabling the pageserver to enter the
correct state for each tenant on startup.

### Database schema for locations

A new table `ProjectLocation`:

- pageserver_id: int
- tenant_id: TenantId
- generation: Option<int>
- state: `enum(Secondary, AttachedSingle, AttachedMulti)`

Notes:

- It is legacy for a Project to have zero `ProjectLocation`s
- The `pageserver` column in `Project` now means "to which pageserver should
  endpoints connect", rather than simply which pageserver is attached.
- The `generation` column in `Project` remains, and is incremented and used
  to set the generation of `ProjectLocation` rows when they are set into
  an attached state.
- The `Detached` state is implicitly represented as the absence of
  a `ProjectLocation`.

### Executing migrations

Migrations will be implemented as Go functions, within the
existing `Operation` framework in the control plane. These
operations are persistent, such that they will always keep
trying until completion: this property is important to avoid
leaving garbage behind on pageservers, such as AttachedStale
locations.

### Recovery from failures during migration

During migration, the control plane may encounter failures of either
the original or new pageserver, or both:

- If the original fails, skip past waiting for the new pageserver
  to catch up, and put it into AttachedSingle immediately.
- If the new node fails, put the old pageserver into Secondary
  and then back into AttachedSingle (this has the effect of
  retaining on-disk state and granting it a fresh generation number).
- If both nodes fail, keep trying until one of them is available
  again.

### Control plane -> Pageserver reconciliation

A migration may be done while the old node is unavailable,
in which case the old node may still be running in an AttachedStale
state.

In this case, it is undesirable to have the migration `Operation`
stay alive until the old node eventually comes back online
and can be cleaned up. To handle this, the control plane
should run a background reconciliation process to compare
a pageserver's attachments with the database, and clean up
any that shouldn't be there any more.

Note that there will be no work to do if the old node was really
offline, as during startup it will call into `/re-attach` and
be updated that way. The reconciliation will only be needed
if the node was unavailable but still running.

## Alternatives considered

### Only enabling secondary locations for tenants on a higher service tier

This will make sense in future, especially for tiny databases that may be
downloaded from S3 in milliseconds when needed.

However, it is not wise to do it immediately, because pageservers contain
a mixture of higher and lower tier workloads. If we had 1 tenant with
a secondary location and 9 without, then those other 9 tenants will do
a lot of I/O as they try to recover from S3, which may degrade the
service of the tenant which had a secondary location.

Until we segregate tenant on different service tiers on different pageserver
nodes, or implement & test QoS to ensure that tenants with secondaries are
not harmed by tenants without, we should use the same failover approach
for all the tenants.

### Hot secondary locations (continuous WAL replay)

Instead of secondary locations populating their caches from S3, we could
have them consume the WAL from safekeepers. The downsides of this would be:

- Double load on safekeepers, which are a less scalable service than S3
- Secondary locations' on-disk state would end up subtly different to
  the remote state, which would make synchronizing with S3 more complex/expensive
  when going into attached state.

The downside of only updating secondary locations from S3 is that we will
have a delay during migration from replaying the LSN range between what's
in S3 and what's in the pageserver. This range will be very small on
planned migrations, as we have the old pageserver flush to S3 immediately
before attaching the new pageserver. On unplanned migrations (old pageserver
is unavailable), the range of LSNs to replay is bounded by the flush frequency
on the old pageserver. However, the migration doesn't have to wait for the
replay: it's just that not-yet-replayed LSNs will be unavailable for read
until the new pageserver catches up.

We expect that pageserver reads of the most recent LSNs will be relatively
rare, as for an active endpoint those pages will usually still be in the postgres
page cache: this leads us to prefer synchronizing from S3 on secondary
locations, rather than consuming the WAL from safekeepers.

### Cold secondary locations

It is not functionally necessary to keep warm caches on secondary locations at all. However, if we do not, then
we would experience a de-facto availability loss in unplanned migrations, as reads to the new node would take an extremely long time (many seconds, perhaps minutes).

Warm caches on secondary locations are necessary to meet
our availability goals.

### Pageserver-granularity failover

Instead of migrating tenants individually, we could have entire spare nodes,
and on a node death, move all its work to one of these spares.

This approach is avoided for several reasons:

- we would still need fine-grained tenant migration for other
  purposes such as balancing load
- by sharing the spare capacity over many peers rather than one spare node,
  these peers may use the capacity for other purposes, until it is needed
  to handle migrated tenants. e.g. for keeping a deeper cache of their
  attached tenants.

### Readonly during migration

We could simplify migrations by making both previous and new nodes go into a
readonly state, then flush remote content from the previous node, then activate
attachment on the secondary node.

The downside to this approach is a potentially large gap in readability of
recent LSNs while loading data onto the new node. To avoid this, it is worthwhile
to incur the extra cost of double-replaying the WAL onto old and new nodes' local
storage during a migration.

### Peer-to-peer pageserver communication

Rather than uploading the heatmap to S3, attached pageservers could make it
available to peers.

Currently, pageservers have no peer to peer communication, so adding this
for heatmaps would incur significant overhead in deployment and configuration
of the service, and ensuring that when a new pageserver is deployed, other
pageservers are updated to be aware of it.

As well as simplifying implementation, putting heatmaps in S3 will be useful
for future analytics purposes -- gathering aggregated statistics on activity
patterns across many tenants may be done directly from data in S3.

# Per-Tenant GetPage@LSN Throttling

Author: Christian Schwarz
Date: Oct 24, 2023

## Summary

This RFC proposes per-tenant throttling of GetPage@LSN requests inside Pageserver
and the interactions with its client, i.e., the neon_smgr component in Compute.

The result of implementing & executing this RFC will be a fleet-wide upper limit for
**"the highest GetPage/second that Pageserver can support for a single tenant/shard"**.

## Background

### GetPage@LSN Request Flow

Pageserver exposes its `page_service.rs` as a libpq listener.
The Computes' `neon_smgr` module connects to that libpq listener.
Once a connection is established, the protocol allows Compute to request page images at a given LSN.
We call these requests GetPage@LSN requests, or GetPage requests for short.
Other request types can be sent, but these are low traffic compared to GetPage requests
and are not the concern of this RFC.

Pageserver associates one libpq connection with one tokio task.

Per connection/task, the pq protocol is handled by the common `postgres_backend` crate.
Its `run_message_loop` function invokes the `page_service` specific `impl<IO> postgres_backend::Handler<IO> for PageServerHandler`.
Requests are processed in the order in which they arrive via the TCP-based pq protocol.
So, there is no concurrent request processing within one connection/task.

There is a degree of natural pipelining:
Compute can "fill the pipe" by sending more than one GetPage request into the libpq TCP stream.
And Pageserver can fill the pipe with responses in the other direction.
Both directions are subject to the limit of tx/rx buffers, nodelay, TCP flow control, etc.

### GetPage@LSN Access Pattern

The Compute has its own hierarchy of caches, specifically `shared_buffers` and the `local file cache` (LFC).
Compute only issues GetPage requests to Pageserver if it encounters a miss in these caches.

If the working set stops fitting into Compute's caches, requests to Pageserver increase sharply -- the Compute starts *thrashing*.

## Motivation

In INC-69, a tenant issued 155k GetPage/second for a period of 10 minutes and 60k GetPage/second for a period of 3h,
then dropping to ca 18k GetPage/second for a period of 9h.

We noticed this because of an internal GetPage latency SLO burn rate alert, i.e.,
the request latency profile during this period significantly exceeded what was acceptable according to the internal SLO.

Sadly, we do not have the observability data to determine the impact of this tenant on other tenants on the same tenants.

However, here are some illustrative data points for the 155k period:
The tenant was responsible for >= 99% of the GetPage traffic and, frankly, the overall activity on this Pageserver instance.
We were serving pages at 10 Gb/s (`155k x 8 kbyte (PAGE_SZ) per second is 1.12GiB/s = 9.4Gb/s.`)
The CPU utilization of the instance was 75% user+system.
Pageserver page cache served 1.75M accesses/second at a hit rate of ca 90%.
The hit rate for materialized pages was ca. 40%.
Curiously, IOPS to the Instance Store NVMe were very low, rarely exceeding 100.

The fact that the IOPS were so low / the materialized page cache hit rate was so high suggests that **this tenant's compute's caches were thrashing**.
The compute was of type `k8s-pod`; hence, auto-scaling could/would not have helped remediate the thrashing by provisioning more RAM.
The consequence was that the **thrashing translated into excessive GetPage requests against Pageserver**.

My claim is that it was **unhealthy to serve this workload at the pace we did**:
* it is likely that other tenants were/would have experienced high latencies (again, we sadly don't have per-tenant latency data to confirm this)
* more importantly, it was **unsustainable** to serve traffic at this pace for multiple reasons:
    * **predictability of performance**: when the working set grows, the pageserver materialized page cache hit rate drops.
      At some point, we're bound by the EC2 Instance Store NVMe drive's IOPS limit.
      The result is an **uneven** performance profile from the Compute perspective.

    * **economics**: Neon currently does not charge for IOPS, only capacity.
      **We cannot afford to undercut the market in IOPS/$ this drastically; it leads to adverse selection and perverse incentives.**
      For example, the 155k IOPS, which we served for 10min, would cost ca. 6.5k$/month when provisioned as an io2 EBS volume.
      Even the 18k IOPS, which we served for 9h, would cost ca. 1.1k$/month when provisioned as an io2 EBS volume.
      We charge 0$.
      It could be economically advantageous to keep using a low-DRAM compute because Pageserver IOPS are fast enough and free.


Note: It is helpful to think of Pageserver as a disk, because it's precisely where `neon_smgr` sits:
vanilla Postgres gets its pages from disk, Neon Postgres gets them from Pageserver.
So, regarding the above performance & economic arguments, it is fair to say that we currently provide an "as-fast-as-possible-IOPS" disk that we charge for only by capacity.

## Solution: Throttling GetPage Requests

**The consequence of the above analysis must be that Pageserver throttles GetPage@LSN requests**.
That is, unless we want to start charging for provisioned GetPage@LSN/second.
Throttling sets the correct incentive for a thrashing Compute to scale up its DRAM to the working set size.
Neon Autoscaling will make this easy, [eventually](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/3913).

## The Design Space

What that remains is the question about *policy* and *mechanism*:

**Policy** concerns itself with the question of what limit applies to a given connection|timeline|tenant.
Candidates are:

* hard limit, same limit value per connection|timeline|tenant
    * Per-tenant will provide an upper bound for the impact of a tenant on a given Pageserver instance.
      This is a major operational pain point / risk right now.
* hard limit, configurable per connection|timeline|tenant
    * This outsources policy to console/control plane, with obvious advantages for flexible structuring of what service we offer to customers.
    * Note that this is not a mechanism to guarantee a minium provisioned rate, i.e., this is not a mechanism to guarantee a certain QoS for a tenant.
* fair share among active connections|timelines|tenants per instance
    * example: each connection|timeline|tenant gets a fair fraction of the machine's GetPage/second capacity
    * NB: needs definition of "active", and knowledge of available GetPage/second capacity in advance
* ...


Regarding **mechanism**, it's clear that **backpressure** is the way to go.
However, we must choose between
* **implicit** backpressure through pq/TCP and
* **explicit** rejection of requests + retries with exponential backoff

Further, there is the question of how throttling GetPage@LSN will affect the **internal GetPage latency SLO**:
where do we measure the SLI for Pageserver's internal getpage latency SLO? Before or after the throttling?

And when we eventually move the measurement point into the Computes (to avoid coordinated omission),
how do we avoid counting throttling-induced latency toward the internal getpage latency SLI/SLO?

## Scope Of This RFC

**This RFC proposes introducing a hard GetPage@LSN/second limit per tenant, with the same value applying to each tenant on a Pageserver**.

This proposal is easy to implement and significantly de-risks operating large Pageservers,
based on the assumption that extremely-high-GetPage-rate-episodes like the one from the "Motivation" section are uncorrelated between tenants.

For example, suppose we pick a limit that allows up to 10 tenants to go at limit rate.
Suppose our Pageserver can serve 100k GetPage/second total at a 100% page cache miss rate.
If each tenant gets a hard limit of 10k GetPage/second, we can serve up to 10 tenants at limit speed without latency degradation.

The mechanism for backpressure will be TCP-based implicit backpressure.
The compute team isn't concerned about prefetch queue depth.
Pageserver will implement it by delaying the reading of requests from the libpq connection(s).

The rate limit will be implemented using a per-tenant token bucket.
The bucket will be be shared among all connections to the tenant.
The bucket implementation supports starvation-preventing `await`ing.
The current candidate for the implementation is [`leaky_bucket`](https://docs.rs/leaky-bucket/).
The getpage@lsn benchmark that's being added in https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/5771
can be used to evaluate the overhead of sharing the bucket among connections of a tenant.
A possible technique to mitigate the impact of sharing the bucket would be to maintain a buffer of a few tokens per connection handler.

Regarding metrics / the internal GetPage latency SLO:
we will measure the GetPage latency SLO _after_ the throttler and introduce a new metric to measure the amount of throttling, quantified by:
- histogram that records the tenants' observations of queue depth before they start waiting (one such histogram per pageserver)
- histogram that records the tenants' observations of time spent waiting (one such histogram per pageserver)

Further observability measures:
- an INFO log message at frequency 1/min if the tenant/timeline/connection was throttled in that last minute.
  The message will identify the tenant/timeline/connection to allow correlation with compute logs/stats.

Rollout will happen as follows:
- deploy 1: implementation + config: disabled by default, ability to enable it per tenant through tenant_conf
- experimentation in staging and later production to study impact & interaction with auto-scaling
- determination of a sensible global default value
  - the value will be chosen as high as possible ...
  - ... but low enough to work towards this RFC's goal that one tenant should not be able to dominate a pageserver instance.
- deploy 2: implementation fixes if any + config: enabled by default with the aforementioned global default
- reset of the experimental per-tenant overrides
- gain experience & lower the limit over time
  - we stop lowering the limit as soon as this RFC's goal is achieved, i.e.,
    once we decide that in practice the chosen value sufficiently de-risks operating large pageservers

The per-tenant override will remain for emergencies and testing.
But since Console doesn't preserve it during tenant migrations, it isn't durably configurable for the tenant.

Toward the upper layers of the Neon stack, the resulting limit will be
**"the highest GetPage/second that Pageserver can support for a single tenant"**.

### Rationale

We decided against error + retry because of worries about starvation.

## Future Work

Enable per-tenant emergency override of the limit via Console.
Should be part of a more general framework to specify tenant config overrides.
**NB:** this is **not** the right mechanism to _sell_ different max GetPage/second levels to users,
or _auto-scale_ the GetPage/second levels. Such functionality will require a separate RFC that
concerns itself with GetPage/second capacity planning.

Compute-side metrics for GetPage latency.

Back-channel to inform Compute/Autoscaling/ControlPlane that the project is being throttled.

Compute-side neon_smgr improvements to avoid sending the same GetPage request multiple times if multiple backends experience a cache miss.

Dealing with read-only endpoints: users use read-only endpoints to scale reads for a single tenant.
Possibly there are also assumptions around read-only endpoints not affecting the primary read-write endpoint's performance.
With per-tenant rate limiting, we will not meet that expectation.
However, we can currently only scale per tenant.
Soon, we will have sharding (#5505), which will apply the throttling on a per-shard basis.
But, that's orthogonal to scaling reads: if many endpoints hit one shard, they share the same throttling limit.
To solve this properly, I think we'll need replicas for tenants / shard.
To performance-isolate a tenant's endpoints from each other, we'd then route them to different replicas.

# Name

Created on: 2023-09-08
Author: Arpad Müller

## Summary

Enable the pageserver to recover from data corruption events by implementing
a feature to re-apply historic WAL records in parallel to the already occurring
WAL replay.

The feature is outside of the user-visible backup and history story, and only
serves as a second-level backup for the case that there is a bug in the
pageservers that corrupted the served pages.

The RFC proposes the addition of two new features:
* recover a broken branch from WAL (downtime is allowed)
* a test recovery system to recover random branches to make sure recovery works

## Motivation

The historic WAL is currently stored in S3 even after it has been replayed by
the pageserver and thus been integrated into the pageserver's storage system.
This is done to defend from data corruption failures inside the pageservers.

However, application of this WAL in the disaster recovery setting is currently
very manual and we want to automate this to make it easier.

### Use cases

There are various use cases for this feature, like:

* The main motivation is replaying in the instance of pageservers corrupting
  data.
* We might want to, beyond the user-visible history features, through our
  support channels and upon customer request, in select instances, recover
  historic versions beyond the range of history that we officially support.
* Running the recovery process in the background for random tenant timelines
  to figure out if there was a corruption of data (we would compare with what
  the pageserver stores for the "official" timeline).
* Using the WAL to arrive at historic pages we can then back up to S3 so that
  WAL itself can be discarded, or at least not used for future replays.
  Again, this sounds a lot like what the pageserver is already doing, but the
  point is to provide a fallback to the service provided by the pageserver.

## Design

### Design constraints

The main design constraint is that the feature needs to be *simple* enough that
the number of bugs are as low, and reliability as high as possible: the main
goal of this endeavour is to achieve higher correctness than the pageserver.

For the background process, we cannot afford a downtime of the timeline that is
being cloned, as we don't want to restrict ourselves to offline tenants only.
In the scenario where we want to recover from disasters or roll back to a
historic lsn through support staff, downtimes are more affordable, and
inevitable if the original had been subject to the corruption. Ideally, the
two code paths would share code, so the solution would be designed for not
requiring downtimes.

### API endpoint changes

This RFC proposes two API endpoint changes in the safekeeper and the
pageserver.

Remember, the pageserver timeline API creation endpoint is to this URL:

```
/v1/tenant/{tenant_id}/timeline/
```

Where `{tenant_id}` is the ID of the tenant the timeline is created for,
and specified as part of the URL. The timeline ID is passed via the POST
request body as the only required parameter `new_timeline_id`.

This proposal adds one optional parameter called
`existing_initdb_timeline_id` to the request's json body. If the parameter
is not specified, behaviour should be as existing, so the pageserver runs
initdb.
If the parameter is specified, it is expected to point to a timeline ID.
In fact that ID might match `new_timeline_id`, what's important is that
S3 storage contains a matching initdb under the URL matching the given
tenant and timeline.

Having both `ancestor_timeline_id` and `existing_initdb_timeline_id`
specified is illegal and will yield in an HTTP error. This feature is
only meant for the "main" branch that doesn't have any ancestors
of its own, as only here initdb is relevant.

For the safekeeper, we propose the addition of the following copy endpoint:

```
/v1/tenant/{tenant_id}/timeline/{source_timeline_id}/copy
```
it is meant for POST requests with json, and the two URL parameters
`tenant_id` and `source_timeline_id`. The json request body contains
the two required parameters `target_timeline_id` and `until_lsn`.

After invoking, the copy endpoint starts a copy process of the WAL from
the source ID to the target ID. The lsn is updated according to the
progress of the API call.

### Higher level features

We want the API changes to support the following higher level features:

* recovery-after-corruption DR of the main timeline of a tenant. This
  feature allows for downtime.
* test DR of the main timeline into a special copy timeline. this feature
  is meant to run against selected production tenants in the background,
  without the user noticing, so it does not allow for downtime.

The recovery-after-corruption DR only needs the pageserver changes.
It works as follows:

* delete the timeline from the pageservers via timeline deletion API
* re-create it via timeline creation API (same ID as before) and set
  `existing_initdb_timeline_id` to the same timeline ID

The test DR requires also the copy primitive and works as follows:

* copy the WAL of the timeline to a new place
* create a new timeline for the tenant

## Non Goals

At the danger of being repetitive, the main goal of this feature is to be a
backup method, so reliability is very important. This implies that other
aspects like performance or space reduction are less important.

### Corrupt WAL

The process suggested by this RFC assumes that the WAL is free of corruption.
In some instances, corruption can make it into WAL, like for example when
higher level components like postgres or the application first read corrupt
data, and then execute a write with data derived from that earlier read. That
written data might then contain the corruption.

Common use cases can hit this quite easily. For example, an application reads
some counter, increments it, and then writes the new counter value to the
database.
On a lower level, the compute might put FPIs (Full Page Images) into the WAL,
which have corrupt data for rows unrelated to the write operation at hand.

Separating corrupt writes from non-corrupt ones is a hard problem in general,
and if the application was involved in making the corrupt write, a recovery
would also involve the application. Therefore, corruption that has made it into
the WAL is outside of the scope of this feature. However, the WAL replay can be
issued to right before the point in time where the corruption occurred. Then the
data loss is isolated to post-corruption writes only.

## Impacted components (e.g. pageserver, safekeeper, console, etc)

Most changes would happen to the pageservers.
For the higher level features, maybe other components like the console would
be involved.

We need to make sure that the shadow timelines are not subject to the usual
limits and billing we apply to existing timelines.

## Proposed implementation

The first problem to keep in mind is the reproducibility of `initdb`.
So an initial step would be to upload `initdb` snapshots to S3.

After that, we'd have the endpoint spawn a background process which
performs the replay of the WAL to that new timeline. This process should
follow the existing workflows as closely as possible, just using the
WAL records of a different timeline.

The timeline created will be in a special state that solely looks for WAL
entries of the timeline it is trying to copy. Once the target LSN is reached,
it turns into a normal timeline that also accepts writes to its own
timeline ID.

### Scalability

For now we want to run this entire process on a single node, and as
it is by nature linear, it's hard to parallelize. However, for the
verification workloads, we can easily start the WAL replay in parallel
for different points in time. This is valuable especially for tenants
with large WAL records.

Compare this with the tricks to make addition circuits execute with
lower latency by making them perform the addition for both possible
values of the carry bit, and then, in a second step, taking the
result for the carry bit that was actually obtained.

The other scalability dimension to consider is the WAL length, which
is a growing question as tenants accumulate changes. There are
possible approaches to this, including creating snapshots of the
page files and uploading them to S3, but if we do this for every single
branch, we lose the cheap branching property.

# Vectored Timeline Get

Created on: 2024-01-02
Author: Christian Schwarz

# Summary

A brief RFC / GitHub Epic describing a vectored version of the `Timeline::get` method that is at the heart of Pageserver.

# Motivation

During basebackup, we issue many `Timeline::get` calls for SLRU pages that are *adjacent* in key space.
For an example, see
https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/5c88213eaf1b1e29c610a078d0b380f69ed49a7e/pageserver/src/basebackup.rs#L281-L302.

Each of these `Timeline::get` calls must traverse the layer map to gather reconstruct data (`Timeline::get_reconstruct_data`) for the requested page number (`blknum` in the example).
For each layer visited by layer map traversal, we do a `DiskBtree` point lookup.
If it's negative (no entry), we resume layer map traversal.
If it's positive, we collect the result in our reconstruct data bag.
If the reconstruct data bag contents suffice to reconstruct the page, we're done with `get_reconstruct_data` and move on to walredo.
Otherwise, we resume layer map traversal.

Doing this many `Timeline::get` calls is quite inefficient because:

1. We do the layer map traversal repeatedly, even if, e.g., all the data sits in the same image layer at the bottom of the stack.
2. We may visit many DiskBtree inner pages multiple times for point lookup of different keys.
   This is likely particularly bad for L0s which span the whole key space and hence must be visited by layer map traversal, but
   may not contain the data we're looking for.
3. Anecdotally, keys adjacent in keyspace and written simultaneously also end up physically adjacent in the layer files [^1].
   So, to provide the reconstruct data for N adjacent keys, we would actually only _need_ to issue a single large read to the filesystem, instead of the N reads we currently do.
   The filesystem, in turn, ideally stores the layer file physically contiguously, so our large read will turn into one IOP toward the disk.

[^1]: https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/Christian-Investigation-Slow-Basebackups-Early-2023-12-34ea5c7dcdc1485d9ac3731da4d2a6fc?pvs=4#15ee4e143392461fa64590679c8f54c9

# Solution

We should have a vectored aka batched aka scatter-gather style alternative API for `Timeline::get`. Having such an API  unlocks:

* more efficient basebackup
* batched IO during compaction (useful for strides of unchanged pages)
* page_service: expose vectored get_page_at_lsn for compute (=> good for seqscan / prefetch)
  * if [on-demand SLRU downloads](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6151) land before vectored Timeline::get, on-demand SLRU downloads will still benefit from this API

# DoD

There is a new variant of `Timeline::get`, called `Timeline::get_vectored`.
It takes as arguments an `lsn: Lsn` and a `src: &[KeyVec]` where `struct KeyVec { base: Key, count: usize }`.

It is up to the implementor to figure out a suitable and efficient way to return the reconstructed page images.
It is sufficient to simply return a `Vec<Bytes>`, but, likely more efficient solutions can be found after studying all the callers of `Timeline::get`.

Functionally, the behavior of `Timeline::get_vectored` is equivalent to

```rust
let mut keys_iter: impl Iterator<Item=Key>
  = src.map(|KeyVec{ base, count }| (base..base+count)).flatten();
let mut out = Vec::new();
for key in keys_iter {
    let data = Timeline::get(key, lsn)?;
    out.push(data);
}
return out;
```

However, unlike above, an ideal solution will

* Visit each `struct Layer` at most once.
* For each visited layer, call `Layer::get_value_reconstruct_data` at most once.
  * This means, read each `DiskBtree` page at most once.
* Facilitate merging of the reads we issue to the OS and eventually NVMe.

Each of these items above represents a significant amount of work.

## Performance

Ideally, the **base performance** of a vectored get of a single page should be identical to the current `Timeline::get`.
A reasonable constant overhead over current `Timeline::get` is acceptable.

The performance improvement for the vectored use case is demonstrated in some way, e.g., using the `pagebench` basebackup benchmark against a tenant with a lot of SLRU segments.

# Implementation

High-level set of tasks / changes to be made:

- **Get clarity on API**:
  - Define naive `Timeline::get_vectored` implementation & adopt it across pageserver.
  - The tricky thing here will be the return type (e.g. `Vec<Bytes>` vs `impl Stream`).
  - Start with something simple to explore the different usages of the API.
    Then iterate with peers until we have something that is good enough.
- **Vectored Layer Map traversal**
  - Vectored `LayerMap::search` (take 1 LSN and N `Key`s instead of just 1 LSN and 1 `Key`)
  - Refactor `Timeline::get_reconstruct_data` to hold & return state for N `Key`s instead of 1
    - The slightly tricky part here is what to do about `cont_lsn` [after we've found some reconstruct data for some keys](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/d066dad84b076daf3781cdf9a692098889d3974e/pageserver/src/tenant/timeline.rs#L2378-L2385)
      but need more.
      Likely we'll need to keep track of `cont_lsn` per key and continue next iteration at `max(cont_lsn)` of all keys that still need data.
- **Vectored `Layer::get_value_reconstruct_data` / `DiskBtree`**
  - Current code calls it [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/d066dad84b076daf3781cdf9a692098889d3974e/pageserver/src/tenant/timeline.rs#L2378-L2384).
  - Delta layers use `DiskBtreeReader::visit()` to collect the `(offset,len)` pairs for delta record blobs to load.
  - Image layers use `DiskBtreeReader::get` to get the offset of the image blob to load. Underneath, that's just a `::visit()` call.
  - What needs to happen to `DiskBtree::visit()`?
    * Minimally
      * take a single `KeyVec` instead of a single `Key` as argument, i.e., take a single contiguous key range to visit.
      * Change the visit code to to invoke the callback for all values in the `KeyVec`'s key range
      * This should be good enough for what we've seen when investigating basebackup slowness, because there, the key ranges are contiguous.
    * Ideally:
      * Take a `&[KeyVec]`, sort it;
      * during Btree traversal, peek at the next `KeyVec` range to determine whether we need to descend or back out.
      * NB: this should be a straight-forward extension of the minimal solution above, as we'll already be checking for "is there more key range in the requested `KeyVec`".
- **Facilitate merging of the reads we issue to the OS and eventually NVMe.**
  - The `DiskBtree::visit` produces a set of offsets which we then read from a `VirtualFile` [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/292281c9dfb24152b728b1a846cc45105dac7fe0/pageserver/src/tenant/storage_layer/delta_layer.rs#L772-L804)
    - [Delta layer reads](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/292281c9dfb24152b728b1a846cc45105dac7fe0/pageserver/src/tenant/storage_layer/delta_layer.rs#L772-L804)
      - We hit (and rely) on `PageCache` and `VirtualFile here (not great under pressure)
    - [Image layer reads](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/292281c9dfb24152b728b1a846cc45105dac7fe0/pageserver/src/tenant/storage_layer/image_layer.rs#L429-L435)
  - What needs to happen is the **vectorization of the `blob_io` interface and then the `VirtualFile` API**.
  - That is tricky because
    - the `VirtualFile` API, which sits underneath `blob_io`, is being touched by ongoing [io_uring work](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/5824)
    - there's the question how IO buffers will be managed; currently this area relies heavily on `PageCache`, but there's controversy around the future of `PageCache`.
      - The guiding principle here should be to avoid coupling this work to the `PageCache`.
      - I.e., treat `PageCache` as an extra hop in the I/O chain, rather than as an integral part of buffer management.


Let's see how we can improve by doing the first three items in above list first, then revisit.

## Rollout / Feature Flags

No feature flags are required for this epic.

At the end of this epic, `Timeline::get` forwards to `Timeline::get_vectored`, i.e., it's an all-or-nothing type of change.

It is encouraged to deliver this feature incrementally, i.e., do many small PRs over multiple weeks.
That will help isolate performance regressions across weekly releases.

# Interaction With Sharding

[Sharding](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/5432) splits up the key space, see functions `is_key_local` / `key_to_shard_number`.

Just as with `Timeline::get`, callers of `Timeline::get_vectored` are responsible for ensuring that they only ask for blocks of the given `struct Timeline`'s shard.

Given that this is already the case, there shouldn't be significant interaction/interference with sharding.

However, let's have a safety check for this constraint (error or assertion) because there are currently few affordances at the higher layers of Pageserver for sharding<=>keyspace interaction.
For example, `KeySpace` is not broken up by shard stripe, so if someone naively converted the compaction code to issue a vectored get for a keyspace range it would violate this constraint.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/031-sharding-static.md:

# Sharding Phase 1: Static Key-space Sharding

## Summary

To enable databases with sizes approaching the capacity of a pageserver's disk,
it is necessary to break up the storage for the database, or _shard_ it.

Sharding in general is a complex area. This RFC aims to define an initial
capability that will permit creating large-capacity databases using a static configuration
defined at time of Tenant creation.

## Motivation

Currently, all data for a Tenant, including all its timelines, is stored on a single
pageserver. The local storage required may be several times larger than the actual
database size, due to LSM write inflation.

If a database is larger than what one pageserver can hold, then it becomes impossible
for the pageserver to hold it in local storage, as it must do to provide service to
clients.

### Prior art

In Neon:

- Layer File Spreading: https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/One-Pager-Layer-File-Spreading-Konstantin-21fd9b11b618475da5f39c61dd8ab7a4
- Layer File SPreading: https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/One-Pager-Layer-File-Spreading-Christian-eb6b64182a214e11b3fceceee688d843
- Key Space partitioning: https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/One-Pager-Key-Space-Partitioning-Stas-8e3a28a600a04a25a68523f42a170677

Prior art in other distributed systems is too broad to capture here: pretty much
any scale out storage system does something like this.

## Requirements

- Enable creating a large (for example, 16TiB) database without requiring dedicated
  pageserver nodes.
- Share read/write bandwidth costs for large databases across pageservers, as well
  as storage capacity, in order to avoid large capacity databases acting as I/O hotspots
  that disrupt service to other tenants.
- Our data distribution scheme should handle sparse/nonuniform keys well, since postgres
  does not write out a single contiguous ranges of page numbers.

_Note: the definition of 'large database' is arbitrary, but the lower bound is to ensure that a database
that a user might create on a current-gen enterprise SSD should also work well on
Neon. The upper bound is whatever postgres can handle: i.e. we must make sure that the
pageserver backend is not the limiting factor in the database size_.

## Non Goals

- Independently distributing timelines within the same tenant. If a tenant has many
  timelines, then sharding may be a less efficient mechanism for distributing load than
  sharing out timelines between pageservers.
- Distributing work in the LSN dimension: this RFC focuses on the Key dimension only,
  based on the idea that separate mechanisms will make sense for each dimension.

## Impacted Components

pageserver, control plane, postgres/smgr

## Terminology

**Key**: a postgres page number, qualified by relation. In the sense that the pageserver is a versioned key-value store,
the page number is the key in that store. `Key` is a literal data type in existing code.

**LSN dimension**: this just means the range of LSNs (history), when talking about the range
of keys and LSNs as a two dimensional space.

## Implementation

### Key sharding vs. LSN sharding

When we think of sharding across the two dimensional key/lsn space, this is an
opportunity to think about how the two dimensions differ:

- Sharding the key space distributes the _write_ workload of ingesting data
  and compacting. This work must be carefully managed so that exactly one
  node owns a given key.
- Sharding the LSN space distributes the _historical read_ workload. This work
  can be done by anyone without any special coordination, as long as they can
  see the remote index and layers.

The key sharding is the harder part, and also the more urgent one, to support larger
capacity databases. Because distributing historical LSN read work is a relatively
simpler problem that most users don't have, we defer it to future work. It is anticipated
that some quite simple P2P offload model will enable distributing work for historical
reads: a node which is low on space can call out to peer to ask it to download and
serve reads from a historical layer.

### Key mapping scheme

Having decided to focus on key sharding, we must next decide how we will map
keys to shards. It is proposed to use a "wide striping" approach, to obtain a good compromise
between data locality and avoiding entire large relations mapping to the same shard.

We will define two spaces:

- Key space: unsigned integer
- Shard space: integer from 0 to N-1, where we have N shards.

### Key -> Shard mapping

Keys are currently defined in the pageserver's getpage@lsn interface as follows:

```
pub struct Key {
    pub field1: u8,
    pub field2: u32,
    pub field3: u32,
    pub field4: u32,
    pub field5: u8,
    pub field6: u32,
}


fn rel_block_to_key(rel: RelTag, blknum: BlockNumber) -> Key {
    Key {
        field1: 0x00,
        field2: rel.spcnode,
        field3: rel.dbnode,
        field4: rel.relnode,
        field5: rel.forknum,
        field6: blknum,
    }
}
```

_Note: keys for relation metadata are ignored here, as this data will be mirrored to all
shards. For distribution purposes, we only care about user data keys_

The properties we want from our Key->Shard mapping are:

- Locality in `blknum`, such that adjacent `blknum` will usually map to
  the same stripe and consequently land on the same shard, even though the overall
  collection of blocks in a relation will be spread over many stripes and therefore
  many shards.
- Avoid the same blknum on different relations landing on the same stripe, so that
  with many small relations we do not end up aliasing data to the same stripe/shard.
- Avoid vulnerability to aliasing in the values of relation identity fields, such that
  if there are patterns in the value of `relnode`, these do not manifest as patterns
  in data placement.

To accomplish this, the blknum is used to select a stripe, and stripes are
assigned to shards in a pseudorandom order via a hash. The motivation for
pseudo-random distribution (rather than sequential mapping of stripe to shard)
is to avoid I/O hotspots when sequentially reading multiple relations: we don't want
all relations' stripes to touch pageservers in the same order.

To map a `Key` to a shard:

- Hash the `Key` field 4 (relNode).
- Divide field 6 (`blknum`) field by the stripe size in pages, and combine the
  hash of this with the hash from the previous step.
- The total hash modulo the shard count gives the shard holding this key.

Why don't we use the other fields in the Key?

- We ignore `forknum` for key mapping, because it distinguishes different classes of data
  in the same relation, and we would like to keep the data in a relation together.
- We would like to use spcNode and dbNode, but cannot. Postgres database creation operations can refer to an existing database as a template, such that the created
  database's blocks differ only by spcNode and dbNode from the original. To enable running
  this type of creation without cross-pageserver communication, we must ensure that these
  blocks map to the same shard -- we do this by excluding spcNode and dbNode from the hash.

### Data placement examples

For example, consider the extreme large databases cases of postgres data layout in a system with 8 shards
and a stripe size of 32k pages:

- A single large relation: `blknum` division will break the data up into 4096
  stripes, which will be scattered across the shards.
- 4096 relations of of 32k pages each: each relation will map to exactly one stripe,
  and that stripe will be placed according to the hash of the key fields 4. The
  data placement will be statistically uniform across shards.

Data placement will be more uneven on smaller databases:

- A tenant with 2 shards and 2 relations of one stripe size each: there is a 50% chance
  that both relations land on the same shard and no data lands on the other shard.
- A tenant with 8 shards and one relation of size 12 stripes: 4 shards will have double
  the data of the other four shards.

These uneven cases for small amounts of data do not matter, as long as the stripe size
is an order of magnitude smaller than the amount of data we are comfortable holding
in a single shard: if our system handles shard sizes up to 10-100GB, then it is not an issue if
a tenant has some shards with 256MB size and some shards with 512MB size, even though
the standard deviation of shard size within the tenant is very high. Our key mapping
scheme provides a statistical guarantee that as the tenant's overall data size increases,
uniformity of placement will improve.

### Important Types

#### `ShardIdentity`

Provides the information needed to know whether a particular key belongs
to a particular shard:

- Layout version
- Stripe size
- Shard count
- Shard index

This structure's size is constant. Note that if we had used a differnet key
mapping scheme such as consistent hashing with explicit hash ranges assigned
to each shard, then the ShardIdentity's size would grow with the shard count: the simpler
key mapping scheme used here enables a small fixed size ShardIdentity.

### Pageserver changes

#### Structural

Everywhere the Pageserver currently deals with Tenants, it will move to dealing with
`TenantShard`s, which are just a `Tenant` plus a `ShardIdentity` telling it which part
of the keyspace it owns. An un-sharded tenant is just a `TenantShard` whose `ShardIdentity`
covers the whole keyspace.

When the pageserver writes layers and index_part.json to remote storage, it must
include the shard index & count in the name, to avoid collisions (the count is
necessary for future-proofing: the count will vary in time). These keys
will also include a generation number: the [generation numbers](025-generation-numbers.md) system will work
exactly the same for TenantShards as it does for Tenants today: each shard will have
its own generation number.

#### Storage Format: Keys

For tenants with >1 shard, layer files implicitly become sparse: within the key
range described in the layer name, the layer file for a shard will only hold the
content relevant to stripes assigned to the shard.

For this reason, the LayerFileName within a tenant is no longer unique: different shards
may use the same LayerFileName to refer to different data. We may solve this simply
by including the shard number in the keys used for layers.

The shard number will be included as a prefix (as part of tenant ID), like this:

`pageserver/v1/tenants/<tenant_id>-<shard_number><shard_count>/timelines/<timeline id>/<layer file name>-<generation>`

`pageserver/v1/tenants/<tenant_id>-<shard_number><shard_count>/timelines/<timeline id>/index_part.json-<generation>`

Reasons for this particular format:

- Use of a prefix is convenient for implementation (no need to carry the shard ID everywhere
  we construct a layer file name), and enables efficient listing of index_parts within
  a particular shard-timeline prefix.
- Including the shard _count_ as well as shard number means that in future when we implement
  shard splitting, it will be possible for a parent shard and one of its children to write
  the same layer file without a name collision. For example, a parent shard 0_1 might split
  into two (0_2, 1_2), and in the process of splitting shard 0_2 could write a layer or index_part
  that is distinct from what shard 0_1 would have written at the same place.

In practice, we expect shard counts to be relatively small, so a `u8` will be sufficient,
and therefore the shard part of the path can be a fixed-length hex string like `{:02X}{:02X}`,
for example a single-shard tenant's prefix will be `0001`.

For backward compatibility, we may define a special `ShardIdentity` that has shard_count==0,
and use this as a cue to construct paths with no prefix at all.

#### Storage Format: Indices

In the phase 1 described in this RFC, shards only reference layers they write themselves. However,
when we implement shard splitting in future, it will be useful to enable shards to reference layers
written by other shards (specifically the parent shard during a split), so that shards don't
have to exhaustively copy all data into their own shard-prefixed keys.

To enable this, the `IndexPart` structure will be extended to store the (shard number, shard count)
tuple on each layer, such that it can construct paths for layers written by other shards. This
naturally raises the question of who "owns" such layers written by ancestral shards: this problem
will be addressed in phase 2.

For backward compatibility, any index entry without shard information will be assumed to be
in the legacy shardidentity.

#### WAL Ingest

In Phase 1, all shards will subscribe to the safekeeper to download WAL content. They will filter
it down to the pages relevant to their shard:

- For ordinary user data writes, only retain a write if it matches the ShardIdentity
- For metadata describing relations etc, all shards retain these writes.

The pageservers must somehow give the safekeeper correct feedback on remote_consistent_lsn:
one solution here is for the 0th shard to periodically peek at the IndexParts for all the other shards,
and have only the 0th shard populate remote_consistent_lsn. However, this is relatively
expensive: if the safekeeper can be made shard-aware then it could be taught to use
the max() of all shards' remote_consistent_lsns to decide when to trim the WAL.

#### Compaction/GC

No changes needed.

The pageserver doesn't have to do anything special during compaction
or GC. It is implicitly operating on the subset of keys that map to its ShardIdentity.
This will result in sparse layer files, containing keys only in the stripes that this
shard owns. Where optimizations currently exist in compaction for spotting "gaps" in
the key range, these should be updated to ignore gaps that are due to sharding, to
avoid spuriously splitting up layers ito stripe-sized pieces.

### Compute Endpoints

Compute endpoints will need to:

- Accept a vector of connection strings as part of their configuration from the control plane
- Route pageserver requests according to mapping the hash of key to the correct
  entry in the vector of connection strings.

Doing this in compute rather than routing requests via a single pageserver is
necessary to enable sharding tenants without adding latency from extra hops.

### Control Plane

Tenants, or _Projects_ in the control plane, will each own a set of TenantShards (this will
be 1 for small tenants). Logic for placement of tenant shards is just the same as the current logic for placing
tenants.

Tenant lifecycle operations like deletion will require fanning-out to all the shards
in the tenant. The same goes for timeline creation and deletion: a timeline should
not be considered created until it has been created in all shards.

#### Selectively enabling sharding for large tenants

Initially, we will explicitly enable sharding for large tenants only.

In future, this hint mechanism will become optional when we implement automatic
re-sharding of tenants.

## Future Phases

This section exists to indicate what will likely come next after this phase.

Phases 2a and 2b are amenable to execution in parallel.

### Phase 2a: WAL fan-out

**Problem**: when all shards consume the whole WAL, the network bandwidth used
for transmitting the WAL from safekeeper to pageservers is multiplied by a factor
of the shard count.

Network bandwidth is not our most pressing bottleneck, but it is likely to become
a problem if we set a modest shard count (~8) on a significant number of tenants,
especially as those larger tenants which we shard are also likely to have higher
write bandwidth than average.

### Phase 2b: Shard Splitting

**Problem**: the number of shards in a tenant is defined at creation time and cannot
be changed. This causes excessive sharding for most small tenants, and an upper
bound on scale for very large tenants.

To address this, a _splitting_ feature will later be added. One shard can split its
data into a number of children by doing a special compaction operation to generate
image layers broken up child-shard-wise, and then writing out an `index_part.json` for
each child. This will then require external coordination (by the control plane) to
safely attach these new child shards and then move them around to distribute work.
The opposite _merging_ operation can also be imagined, but is unlikely to be implemented:
once a Tenant has been sharded, the marginal efficiency benefit of merging is unlikely to justify
the risk/complexity of implementing such a rarely-encountered scenario.

### Phase N (future): distributed historical reads

**Problem**: while sharding based on key is good for handling changes in overall
database size, it is less suitable for spiky/unpredictable changes in the read
workload to historical layers. Sudden increases in historical reads could result
in sudden increases in local disk capacity required for a TenantShard.

Example: the extreme case of this would be to run a tenant for a year, then create branches
with ancestors at monthly intervals. This could lead to a sudden 12x inflation in
the on-disk capacity footprint of a TenantShard, since it would be serving reads
from all those disparate historical layers.

If we can respond fast enough, then key-sharding a tenant more finely can help with
this, but splitting may be a relatively expensive operation and the increased historical
read load may be transient.

A separate mechanism for handling heavy historical reads could be something like
a gossip mechanism for pageservers to communicate
about their workload, and then a getpageatlsn offload mechanism where one pageserver can
ask another to go read the necessary layers from remote storage to serve the read. This
requires relativly little coordination because it is read-only: any node can service any
read. All reads to a particular shard would still flow through one node, but the
disk capactity & I/O impact of servicing the read would be distributed.

## FAQ/Alternatives

### Why stripe the data, rather than using contiguous ranges of keyspace for each shard?

When a database is growing under a write workload, writes may predominantly hit the
end of the keyspace, creating a bandwidth hotspot on that shard. Similarly, if the user
is intensively re-writing a particular relation, if that relation lived in a particular
shard then it would not achieve our goal of distributing the write work across shards.

### Why not proxy read requests through one pageserver, so that endpoints don't have to change?

1. This would not achieve scale-out of network bandwidth: a busy tenant with a large
   database would still cause a load hotspot on the pageserver routing its read requests.
2. The additional hop through the "proxy" pageserver would add latency and overall
   resource cost (CPU, network bandwidth)

### Layer File Spreading: use one pageserver as the owner of a tenant, and have it spread out work on a per-layer basis to peers

In this model, there would be no explicit sharding of work, but the pageserver to which
a tenant is attached would not hold all layers on its disk: instead, it would call out
to peers to have them store some layers, and call out to those peers to request reads
in those layers.

This mechanism will work well for distributing work in the LSN dimension, but in the key
space dimension it has the major limitation of requiring one node to handle all
incoming writes, and compactions. Even if the write workload for a large database
fits in one pageserver, it will still be a hotspot and such tenants may still
de-facto require their own pageserver.

# Shard splitting

## Summary

This RFC describes a new pageserver API for splitting an existing tenant shard into
multiple shards, and describes how to use this API to safely increase the total
shard count of a tenant.

## Motivation

In the [sharding RFC](031-sharding-static.md), a mechanism was introduced to scale
tenants beyond the capacity of a single pageserver by breaking up the key space
into stripes, and distributing these stripes across many pageservers. However,
the shard count was defined once at tenant creation time and not varied thereafter.

In practice, the expected size of a database is rarely known at creation time, and
it is inefficient to enable sharding for very small tenants: we need to be
able to create a tenant with a small number of shards (such as 1), and later expand
when it becomes clear that the tenant has grown in size to a point where sharding
is beneficial.

### Prior art

Many distributed systems have the problem of choosing how many shards to create for
tenants that do not specify an expected size up-front. There are a couple of general
approaches:

- Write to a key space in order, and start a new shard when the highest key advances
  past some point. This doesn't work well for Neon, because we write to our key space
  in many different contiguous ranges (per relation), rather than in one contiguous
  range. To adapt to this kind of model, we would need a sharding scheme where each
  relation had its own range of shards, which would be inefficient for the common
  case of databases with many small relations.
- Monitor the system, and automatically re-shard at some size threshold. For
  example in Ceph, the [pg_autoscaler](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/49c27499af4ee9a90f69fcc6bf3597999d6efc7b/src/pybind/mgr/pg_autoscaler/module.py)
  component monitors the size of each RADOS Pool, and adjusts the number of Placement
  Groups (Ceph's shard equivalent).

## Requirements

- A configurable capacity limit per-shard is enforced.
- Changes in shard count do not interrupt service beyond requiring postgres
  to reconnect (i.e. milliseconds).
- Human being does not have to choose shard count

## Non Goals

- Shard splitting is always a tenant-global operation: we will not enable splitting
  one shard while leaving others intact.
- The inverse operation (shard merging) is not described in this RFC. This is a lower
  priority than splitting, because databases grow more often than they shrink, and
  a database with many shards will still work properly if the stored data shrinks, just
  with slightly more overhead (e.g. redundant WAL replication)
- Shard splitting is only initiated based on capacity bounds, not load. Splitting
  a tenant based on load will make sense for some medium-capacity, high-load workloads,
  but is more complex to reason about and likely is not desirable until we have
  shard merging to reduce the shard count again if the database becomes less busy.

## Impacted Components

pageserver, storage controller

(the _storage controller_ is the evolution of what was called `attachment_service` in our test environment)

## Terminology

**Parent** shards are the shards that exist before a split. **Child** shards are
the new shards created during a split.

**Shard** is synonymous with _tenant shard_.

**Shard Index** is the 2-tuple of shard number and shard count, written in
paths as {:02x}{:02x}, e.g. `0001`.

## Background

In the implementation section, a couple of existing aspects of sharding are important
to remember:

- Shard identifiers contain the shard number and count, so that "shard 0 of 1" (`0001`) is
  a distinct shard from "shard 0 of 2" (`0002`). This is the case in key paths, local
  storage paths, and remote index metadata.
- Remote layer file paths contain the shard index of the shard that created them, and
  remote indices contain the same index to enable building the layer file path. A shard's
  index may reference layers that were created by another shard.
- Local tenant shard directories include the shard index. All layers downloaded by
  a tenant shard are stored in this shard-prefixed path, even if those layers were
  initially created by another shard: tenant shards do not read and write one anothers'
  paths.
- The `Tenant` pageserver type represents one tenant _shard_, not the whole tenant.
  This is for historical reasons and will be cleaned up in future, but the existing
  name is used here to help comprehension when reading code.

## Implementation

Note: this section focuses on the correctness of the core split process. This will
be fairly inefficient in a naive implementation, and several important optimizations
are described in a later section.

There are broadly two parts to the implementation:

1. The pageserver split API, which splits one shard on one pageserver
2. The overall tenant split proccess which is coordinated by the storage controller,
   and calls into the pageserver split API as needed.

### Pageserver Split API

The pageserver will expose a new API endpoint at `/v1/tenant/:tenant_shard_id/shard_split`
that takes the new total shard count in the body.

The pageserver split API operates on one tenant shard, on one pageserver. External
coordination is required to use it safely, this is described in the later
'Split procedure' section.

#### Preparation

First identify the shard indices for the new child shards. These are deterministic,
calculated from the parent shard's index, and the number of children being created (this
is an input to the API, and validated to be a power of two). In a trivial example, splitting
0001 in two always results in 0002 and 0102.

Child shard indices are chosen such that the childrens' parts of the keyspace will
be subsets of the parent's parts of the keyspace.

#### Step 1: write new remote indices

In remote storage, splitting is very simple: we may just write new index_part.json
objects for each child shard, containing exactly the same layers as the parent shard.

The children will have more data than they need, but this avoids any exhausive
re-writing or copying of layer files.

The index key path includes a generation number: the parent shard's current
attached generation number will also be used for the child shards' indices. This
makes the operation safely retryable: if everything crashes and restarts, we may
call the split API again on the parent shard, and the result will be some new remote
indices for the child shards, under a higher generation number.

#### Step 2: start new `Tenant` objects

A new `Tenant` object may be instantiated for each child shard, while the parent
shard still exists. When calling the tenant_spawn function for this object,
the remote index from step 1 will be read, and the child shard will start
to ingest WAL to catch up from whatever was in the remote storage at step 1.

We now wait for child shards' WAL ingestion to catch up with the parent shard,
so that we can safely tear down the parent shard without risking an availability
gap to clients reading recent LSNs.

#### Step 3: tear down parent `Tenant` object

Once child shards are running and have caught up with WAL ingest, we no longer
need the parent shard. Note that clients may still be using it -- when we
shut it down, any page_service handlers will also shut down, causing clients
to disconnect. When the client reconnects, it will re-lookup the tenant,
and hit the child shard instead of the parent (shard lookup from page_service
should bias toward higher ShardCount shards).

Note that at this stage the page service client has not yet been notified of
any split. In the trivial single split example:

- Shard 0001 is gone: Tenant object torn down
- Shards 0002 and 0102 are running on the same pageserver where Shard 0001 used to live.
- Clients will continue to connect to that server thinking that shard 0001 is there,
  and all requests will work, because any key that was in shard 0001 is definitely
  available in either shard 0002 or shard 0102.
- Eventually, the storage controller (not the pageserver) will decide to migrate
  some child shards away: at that point it will do a live migration, ensuring
  that the client has an updated configuration before it detaches anything
  from the original server.

#### Complete

When we send a 200 response to the split request, we are promising the caller:

- That the child shards are persistent in remote storage
- That the parent shard has been shut down

This enables the caller to proceed with the overall shard split operation, which
may involve other shards on other pageservers.

### Storage Controller Split procedure

Splitting a tenant requires calling the pageserver split API, and tracking
enough state to ensure recovery + completion in the event of any component (pageserver
or storage controller) crashing (or request timing out) during the split.

1. call the split API on all existing shards. Ensure that the resulting
   child shards are pinned to their pageservers until _all_ the split calls are done.
   This pinning may be implemented as a "split bit" on the tenant shards, that
   blocks any migrations, and also acts as a sign that if we restart, we must go
   through some recovery steps to resume the split.
2. Once all the split calls are done, we may unpin the child shards (clear
   the split bit). The split is now complete: subsequent steps are just migrations,
   not strictly part of the split.
3. Try to schedule new pageserver locations for the child shards, using
   a soft anti-affinity constraint to place shards from the same tenant onto different
   pageservers.

Updating computes about the new shard count is not necessary until we migrate
any of the child shards away from the parent's location.

### Recovering from failures

#### Rolling back an incomplete split

An incomplete shard split may be rolled back quite simply, by attaching the parent shards to pageservers,
and detaching child shards. This will lose any WAL ingested into the children after the parents
were detached earlier, but the parents will catch up.

No special pageserver API is needed for this. From the storage controllers point of view, the
procedure is:

1. For all parent shards in the tenant, ensure they are attached
2. For all child shards, ensure they are not attached
3. Drop child shards from the storage controller's database, and clear the split bit on the parent shards.

Any remote storage content for child shards is left behind. This is similar to other cases where
we may leave garbage objects in S3 (e.g. when we upload a layer but crash before uploading an
index that references it). Future online scrub/cleanup functionality can remove these objects, or
they will be removed when the tenant is deleted, as tenant deletion lists all objects in the prefix,
which would include any child shards that were rolled back.

If any timelines had been created on child shards, they will be lost when rolling back. To mitigate
this, we will **block timeline creation during splitting**, so that we can safely roll back until
the split is complete, without risking losing timelines.

Rolling back an incomplete split will happen automatically if a split fails due to some fatal
reason, and will not be accessible via an API:

- A pageserver fails to complete its split API request after too many retries
- A pageserver returns a fatal unexpected error such as 400 or 500
- The storage controller database returns a non-retryable error
- Some internal invariant is violated in the storage controller split code

#### Rolling back a complete split

A complete shard split may be rolled back similarly to an incomplete split, with the following
modifications:

- The parent shards will no longer exist in the storage controller database, so these must
  be re-synthesized somehow: the hard part of this is figuring the parent shards' generations. This
  may be accomplished either by probing in S3, or by retaining some tombstone state for deleted
  shards in the storage controller database.
- Any timelines that were created after the split complete will disappear when rolling back
  to the tenant shards. For this reason, rolling back after a complete split should only
  be done due to serious issues where loss of recently created timelines is acceptable, or
  in cases where we have confirmed that no timelines were created in the intervening period.
- Parent shards' layers must not have been deleted: this property will come "for free" when
  we first roll out sharding, by simply not implementing deletion of parent layers after
  a split. When we do implement such deletion (see "Cleaning up parent-shard layers" in the
  Optimizations section), it should apply a TTL to layers such that we have a
  defined walltime window in which rollback will be possible.

The storage controller will expose an API for rolling back a complete split, for use
in the field if we encounter some critical bug with a post-split tenant.

#### Retrying API calls during Pageserver Restart

When a pageserver restarts during a split API call, it may witness on-disk content for both parent and
child shards from an ongoing split. This does not intrinsically break anything, and the
pageserver may include all these shards in its `/re-attach` request to the storage controller.

In order to support such restarts, it is important that the storage controller stores
persistent records of each child shard before it calls into a pageserver, as these child shards
may require generation increments via a `/re-attach` request.

The pageserver restart will also result in a failed API call from the storage controller's point
of view. Recall that if _any_ pageserver fails to split, the overall split operation may not
complete, and all shards must remain pinned to their current pageserver locations until the
split is done.

The pageserver API calls during splitting will retry on transient errors, so that
short availability gaps do not result in a failure of the overall operation. The
split in progress will be automatically rolled back if the threshold for API
retries is reached (e.g. if a pageserver stays offline for longer than a typical
restart).

#### Rollback on Storage Controller Restart

On startup, the storage controller will inspect the split bit for tenant shards that
it loads from the database. If any splits are in progress:

- Database content will be reverted to the parent shards
- Child shards will be dropped from memory
- The parent and child shards will be included in the general startup reconciliation that
  the storage controller does: any child shards will be detached from pageservers because
  they don't exist in the storage controller's expected set of shards, and parent shards
  will be attached if they aren't already.

#### Storage controller API request failures/retries

The split request handler will implement idempotency: if the [`Tenant`] requested to split
doesn't exist, we will check for the would-be child shards, and if they already exist,
we consider the request complete.

If a request is retried while the original request is still underway, then the split
request handler will notice an InProgress marker in TenantManager, and return 503
to encourage the client to backoff/retry. This is the same as the general pageserver
API handling for calls that try to act on an InProgress shard.

#### Compute start/restart during a split

If a compute starts up during split, it will be configured with the old sharding
configuration. This will work for reads irrespective of the progress of the split
as long as no child hards have been migrated away from their original location, and
this is guaranteed in the split procedure (see earlier section).

#### Pageserver fails permanently during a split

If a pageserver permanently fails (i.e. the storage controller availability state for it
goes to Offline) while a split is in progress, the splitting operation will roll back, and
during the roll back it will skip any API calls to the offline pageserver. If the offline
pageserver becomes available again, any stale locations will be cleaned up via the normal reconciliation process (the `/re-attach` API).

### Handling secondary locations

For correctness, it is not necessary to split secondary locations. We can simply detach
the secondary locations for parent shards, and then attach new secondary locations
for child shards.

Clearly this is not optimal, as it will result in re-downloads of layer files that
were already present on disk. See "Splitting secondary locations"

### Conditions to trigger a split

The pageserver will expose a new API for reporting on shards that are candidates
for split: this will return a top-N report of the largest tenant shards by
physical size (remote size). This should exclude any tenants that are already
at the maximum configured shard count.

The API would look something like:
`/v1/top_n_tenant?shard_count_lt=8&sort_by=resident_size`

The storage controller will poll that API across all pageservers it manages at some appropriate interval (e.g. 60 seconds).

A split operation will be started when the tenant exceeds some threshold. This threshold
should be _less than_ how large we actually want shards to be, perhaps much less. That's to
minimize the amount of work involved in splitting -- if we want 100GiB shards, we shouldn't
wait for a tenant to exceed 100GiB before we split anything. Some data analysis of existing
tenant size distribution may be useful here: if we can make a statement like "usually, if
a tenant has exceeded 20GiB they're probably going to exceed 100GiB later", then we might
make our policy to split a tenant at 20GiB.

The finest split we can do is by factors of two, but we can do higher-cardinality splits
too, and this will help to reduce the overhead of repeatedly re-splitting a tenant
as it grows. An example of a very simple heuristic for early deployment of the splitting
feature would be: "Split tenants into 8 shards when their physical size exceeds 64GiB": that
would give us two kinds of tenant (1 shard and 8 shards), and the confidence that once we had
split a tenant, it will not need re-splitting soon after.

## Optimizations

### Flush parent shard to remote storage during split

Any data that is in WAL but not remote storage at time of split will need
to be replayed by child shards when they start for the first time. To minimize
this work, we may flush the parent shard to remote storage before writing the
remote indices for child shards.

It is important that this flush is subject to some time bounds: we may be splitting
in response to a surge of write ingest, so it may be time-critical to split. A
few seconds to flush latest data should be sufficient to optimize common cases without
running the risk of holding up a split for a harmful length of time when a parent
shard is being written heavily. If the flush doesn't complete in time, we may proceed
to shut down the parent shard and carry on with the split.

### Hard linking parent layers into child shard directories

Before we start the Tenant objects for child shards, we may pre-populate their
local storage directories with hard links to the layer files already present
in the parent shard's local directory. When the child shard starts and downloads
its remote index, it will find all those layer files already present on local disk.

This avoids wasting download capacity and makes splitting faster, but more importantly
it avoids taking up a factor of N more disk space when splitting 1 shard into N.

This mechanism will work well in typical flows where shards are migrated away
promptly after a split, but for the general case including what happens when
layers are evicted and re-downloaded after a split, see the 'Proactive compaction'
section below.

### Filtering during compaction

Compaction, especially image layer generation, should skip any keys that are
present in a shard's layer files, but do not match the shard's ShardIdentity's
is_key_local() check. This avoids carrying around data for longer than necessary
in post-split compactions.

This was already implemented in https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/6246

### Proactive compaction

In remote storage, there is little reason to rewrite any data on a shard split:
all the children can reference parent layers via the very cheap write of the child
index_part.json.

In local storage, things are more nuanced. During the initial split there is no
capacity cost to duplicating parent layers, if we implement the hard linking
optimization described above. However, as soon as any layers are evicted from
local disk and re-downloaded, the downloaded layers will not be hard-links any more:
they'll have real capacity footprint. That isn't a problem if we migrate child shards
away from the parent node swiftly, but it risks a significant over-use of local disk
space if we do not.

For example, if we did an 8-way split of a shard, and then _didn't_ migrate 7 of
the shards elsewhere, then churned all the layers in all the shards via eviction,
then we would blow up the storage capacity used on the node by 8x. If we're splitting
a 100GB shard, that could take the pageserver to the point of exhausting disk space.

To avoid this scenario, we could implement a special compaction mode where we just
read historic layers, drop unwanted keys, and write back the layer file. This
is pretty expensive, but useful if we have split a large shard and are not going to
migrate the child shards away.

The heuristic conditions for triggering such a compaction are:

- A) eviction plus time: if a child shard
  has existed for more than a time threshold, and has been requested to perform at least one eviction, then it becomes urgent for this child shard to execute a proactive compaction to reduce its storage footprint, at the cost of I/O load.
- B) resident size plus time: we may inspect the resident layers and calculate how
  many of them include the overhead of storing pre-split keys. After some time
  threshold (different to the one in case A) we still have such layers occupying
  local disk space, then we should proactively compact them.

### Cleaning up parent-shard layers

It is functionally harmless to leave parent shard layers in remote storage indefinitely.
They would be cleaned up in the event of the tenant's deletion.

As an optimization to avoid leaking remote storage capacity (which costs money), we may
lazily clean up parent shard layers once no child shards reference them.

This may be done _very_ lazily: e.g. check every PITR interval. The cleanup procedure is:

- list all the key prefixes beginning with the tenant ID, and select those shard prefixes
  which do not belong to the most-recently-split set of shards (_ancestral shards_, i.e. `shard*count < max(shard_count) over all shards)`, and those shard prefixes which do have the latest shard count (_current shards_)
- If there are no _ancestral shard_ prefixes found, we have nothing to clean up and
  may drop out now.
- find the latest-generation index for each _current shard_, read all and accumulate the set of layers belonging to ancestral shards referenced by these indices.
- for all ancestral shards, list objects in the prefix and delete any layer which was not
  referenced by a current shard.

If this cleanup is scheduled for 1-2 PITR periods after the split, there is a good chance that child shards will have written their own image layers covering the whole keyspace, such that all parent shard layers will be deletable.

The cleanup may be done by the scrubber (external process), or we may choose to have
the zeroth shard in the latest generation do the work -- there is no obstacle to one shard
reading the other shard's indices at runtime, and we do not require visibility of the
latest index writes.

Cleanup should be artificially delayed by some period (for example 24 hours) to ensure
that we retain the option to roll back a split in case of bugs.

### Splitting secondary locations

We may implement a pageserver API similar to the main splitting API, which does a simpler
operation for secondary locations: it would not write anything to S3, instead it would simply
create the child shard directory on local disk, hard link in directories from the parent,
and set up the in memory (TenantSlot) state for the children.

Similar to attached locations, a subset of secondary locations will probably need re-locating
after the split is complete, to avoid leaving multiple child shards on the same pageservers,
where they may use excessive space for the tenant.

## FAQ/Alternatives

### What should the thresholds be set to?

Shard size limit: the pre-sharding default capacity quota for databases was 200GiB, so this could be a starting point for the per-shard size limit.

Max shard count:

- The safekeeper overhead to sharding is currently O(N) network bandwidth because
  the un-filtered WAL is sent to all shards. To avoid this growing out of control,
  a limit of 8 shards should be temporarily imposed until WAL filtering is implemented
  on the safekeeper.
- there is also little benefit to increasing the shard count beyond the number
  of pageservers in a region.

### Is it worth just rewriting all the data during a split to simplify reasoning about space?


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/033-storage-controller-drain-and-fill.md:

# Graceful Restarts of Storage Controller Managed Clusters

## Summary
This RFC describes new storage controller APIs for draining and filling tenant shards from/on pageserver nodes.
It also covers how these new APIs should be used by an orchestrator (e.g. Ansible) in order to implement
graceful cluster restarts.

## Motivation

Pageserver restarts cause read availablity downtime for tenants.

For example pageserver-3 @ us-east-1 was unavailable for a randomly
picked tenant (which requested on-demand activation) for around 30 seconds
during the restart at 2024-04-03 16:37 UTC.

Note that lots of shutdowns on loaded pageservers do not finish within the
[10 second systemd enforced timeout](https://github.com/neondatabase/infra/blob/0a5280b383e43c063d43cbf87fa026543f6d6ad4/.github/ansible/systemd/pageserver.service#L16). This means we are shutting down without flushing ephemeral layers
and have to reingest data in order to serve requests after restarting, potentially making first request latencies worse.

This problem is not yet very acutely felt in storage controller managed pageservers since
tenant density is much lower there. However, we are planning on eventually migrating all
pageservers to storage controller management, so it makes sense to solve the issue proactively.

## Requirements

- Pageserver re-deployments cause minimal downtime for tenants
- The storage controller exposes HTTP API hooks for draining and filling tenant shards
from a given pageserver. Said hooks can be used by an orchestrator proces or a human operator.
- The storage controller exposes some HTTP API to cancel draining and filling background operations.
- Failures to drain or fill the node should not be fatal. In such cases, cluster restarts should proceed
as usual (with downtime).
- Progress of draining/filling is visible through metrics

## Non Goals

- Integration with the control plane
- Graceful restarts for large non-HA tenants.

## Impacted Components

- storage controller
- deployment orchestrator (i.e. Ansible)
- pageserver (indirectly)

## Terminology

** Draining ** is the process through which all tenant shards that can be migrated from a given pageserver
are distributed across the rest of the cluster.

** Filling ** is the symmetric opposite of draining. In this process tenant shards are migrated onto a given
pageserver until the cluster reaches a resonable, quiescent distribution of tenant shards across pageservers.

** Node scheduling policies ** act as constraints to the scheduler. For instance, when a
node is set in the `Paused` policy, no further shards will be scheduled on it.

** Node ** is a pageserver. Term is used interchangeably in this RFC.

** Deployment orchestrator ** is a generic term for whatever drives our deployments.
Currently, it's an Ansible playbook.

## Background

### Storage Controller Basics (skip if already familiar)

Fundamentally, the storage controller is a reconciler which aims to move from the observed mapping between pageservers and tenant shards to an intended mapping. Pageserver nodes and tenant shards metadata is durably persisted in a database, but note that the mapping between the two entities is not durably persisted. Instead, this mapping (*observed state*) is constructed at startup by sending `GET location_config` requests to registered pageservers.

An internal scheduler maps tenant shards to pageservers while respecting certain constraints. The result of scheduling is the *intent state*. When the intent state changes, a *reconciliation* will inform pageservers about the new assigment via `PUT location_config` requests and will notify the compute via the configured hook.

### Background Optimizations

The storage controller performs scheduling optimizations in the background. It will
migrate attachments to warm secondaries and replace secondaries in order to balance
the cluster out.

### Reconciliations Concurrency Limiting

There's a hard limit on the number of reconciles that the storage controller
can have in flight at any given time. To get an idea of scales, the limit is
128 at the time of writing.

## Implementation

Note: this section focuses on the core functionality of the graceful restart process.
It doesn't neccesarily describe the most efficient approach. Optimizations are described
separately in a later section.

### Overall Flow

This section describes how to implement graceful restarts from the perspective
of Ansible, the deployment orchestrator. Pageservers are already restarted sequentially.
The orchestrator shall implement the following epilogue and prologue steps for each
pageserver restart:

#### Prologue

The orchestrator shall first fetch the pageserver node id from the control plane or
the pageserver it aims to restart directly. Next, it issues an HTTP request
to the storage controller in order to start the drain of said pageserver node.
All error responses are retried with a short back-off. When a 202 (Accepted)
HTTP code is returned, the drain has started. Now the orchestrator polls the
node status endpoint exposed by the storage controller in order to await the
end of the drain process. When the `policy` field of the node status response
becomes `PauseForRestart`, the drain has completed and the orchestrator can
proceed with restarting the pageserver.

The prologue is subject to an overall timeout. It will have a value in the ballpark
of minutes. As storage controller managed pageservers become more loaded this timeout
will likely have to increase.

#### Epilogue

After restarting the pageserver, the orchestrator issues an HTTP request
to the storage controller to kick off the filling process. This API call
may be retried for all error codes with a short backoff. This also serves
as a synchronization primitive as the fill will be refused if the pageserver
has not yet re-attached to the storage controller. When a 202(Accepted) HTTP
code is returned, the fill has started. Now the orchestrator polls the node
status endpoint exposed by the storage controller in order to await the end of
the filling process. When the `policy` field of the node status response becomes
`Active`, the fill has completed and the orchestrator may proceed to the next pageserver.

Again, the epilogue is subject to an overall timeout. We can start off with
using the same timeout as for the prologue, but can also consider relying on
the storage controller's background optimizations with a shorter timeout.

In the case that the deployment orchestrator times out, it attempts to cancel
the fill. This operation shall be retried with a short back-off. If it ultimately
fails it will require manual intervention to set the nodes scheduling policy to
`NodeSchedulingPolicy::Active`. Not doing that is not immediately problematic,
but it constrains the scheduler as mentioned previously.

### Node Scheduling Policy State Machine

The state machine below encodes the behaviours discussed above and
the various failover situations described in a later section.

Assuming no failures and/or timeouts the flow should be:
`Active -> Draining -> PauseForRestart -> Active -> Filling -> Active`

### Draining/Filling APIs

The storage controller API to trigger the draining of a given node is:
`PUT /v1/control/node/:node_id/{drain,fill}`.

The following HTTP non-success return codes are used.
All of them are safely retriable from the perspective of the storage controller.
- 404: Requested node was not found
- 503: Requested node is known to the storage controller, but unavailable
- 412: Drain precondition failed: there is no other node to drain to or the node's schedulling policy forbids draining
- 409: A {drain, fill} is already in progress. Only one such background operation
is allowed per node.

When the drain is accepted and commenced a 202 HTTP code is returned.

Drains and fills shall be cancellable by the deployment orchestrator or a
human operator via: `DELETE /v1/control/node/:node_id/{drain,fill}`. A 200
response is returned when the cancelation is successful. Errors are retriable.

### Drain Process

Before accpeting a drain request the following validations is applied:
* Ensure that the node is known the storage controller
* Ensure that the schedulling policy is `NodeSchedulingPolicy::Active` or `NodeSchedulingPolicy::Pause`
* Ensure that another drain or fill is not already running on the node
* Ensure that a drain is possible (i.e. check that there is at least one
schedulable node to drain to)

After accepting the drain, the scheduling policy of the node is set to
`NodeSchedulingPolicy::Draining` and persisted in both memory and the database.
This disallows the optimizer from adding or removing shards from the node which
is desirable to avoid them racing.

Next, a separate Tokio task is spawned to manage the draining. For each tenant
shard attached to the node being drained, demote the node to a secondary and
attempt to schedule the node away. Scheduling might fail due to unsatisfiable
constraints, but that is fine. Draining is a best effort process since it might
not always be possible to cut over all shards.

Importantly, this task manages the concurrency of issued reconciles in order to
avoid drowning out the target pageservers and to allow other important reconciles
to proceed.

Once the triggered reconciles have finished or timed out, set the node's scheduling
policy to `NodeSchedulingPolicy::PauseForRestart` to signal the end of the drain.

A note on non HA tenants: These tenants do not have secondaries, so by the description
above, they would not be migrated. It makes sense to skip them (especially the large ones)
since, depending on tenant size, this might be more disruptive than the restart since the
pageserver we've moved to do will need to on-demand download the entire working set for the tenant.
We can consider expanding to small non-HA tenants in the future.

### Fill Process

Before accpeting a fill request the following validations is applied:
* Ensure that the node is known the storage controller
* Ensure that the schedulling policy is `NodeSchedulingPolicy::Active`.
This is the only acceptable policy for the fill starting state. When a node re-attaches,
it set the scheduling policy to `NodeSchedulingPolicy::Active` if it was equal to
`NodeSchedulingPolicy::PauseForRestart` or `NodeSchedulingPolicy::Draining` (possible end states for a node drain).
* Ensure that another drain or fill is not already running on the node

After accepting the drain, the scheduling policy of the node is set to
`NodeSchedulingPolicy::Filling` and persisted in both memory and the database.
This disallows the optimizer from adding or removing shards from the node which
is desirable to avoid them racing.

Next, a separate Tokio task is spawned to manage the draining. For each tenant
shard where the filled node is a secondary, promote the secondary. This is done
until we run out of shards or the counts of attached shards become balanced across
the cluster.

Like for draining, the concurrency of spawned reconciles is limited.

### Failure Modes & Handling

Failures are generally handled by transition back into the `Active`
(neutral) state. This simplifies the implementation greatly at the
cost of adding transitions to the state machine. For example, we
could detect the `Draining` state upon restart and proceed with a drain,
but how should the storage controller know that's what the orchestrator
needs still?

#### Storage Controller Crash

When the storage controller starts up reset the node scheduling policy
of all nodes in states `Draining`, `Filling` or `PauseForRestart` to
`Active`. The rationale is that when the storage controller restarts,
we have lost context of what the deployment orchestrator wants. It also
has the benefit of making things easier to reason about.

#### Pageserver Crash During Drain

The pageserver will attempt to re-attach during restart at which
point the node scheduling policy will be set back to `Active`, thus
reenabling the scheduler to use the node.

#### Non-drained Pageserver Crash During Drain

What should happen when a pageserver we are draining to crashes during the
process. Two reasonable options are: cancel the drain and focus on the failover
*or* do both, but prioritise failover. Since the number of concurrent reconciles
produced by drains/fills are limited, we get the later behaviour for free.
My suggestion is we take this approach, but the cancellation option is trivial
to implement as well.

#### Pageserver Crash During Fill

The pageserver will attempt to re-attach during restart at which
point the node scheduling policy will be set back to `Active`, thus
reenabling the scheduler to use the node.

#### Pageserver Goes unavailable During Drain/Fill

The drain and fill jobs handle this by stopping early. When the pageserver
is detected as online by storage controller heartbeats, reset its scheduling
policy to `Active`. If a restart happens instead, see the pageserver crash
failure mode.

#### Orchestrator Drain Times Out

Orchestrator will still proceed with the restart.
When the pageserver re-attaches, the scheduling policy is set back to
`Active`.

#### Orchestrator Fill Times Out

Orchestrator will attempt to cancel the fill operation. If that fails,
the fill will continue until it quiesces and the node will be left
in the `Filling` scheduling policy. This hinders the scheduler, but is
otherwise harmless. A human operator can handle this by setting the scheduling
policy to `Active`, or we can bake in a fill timeout into the storage controller.

## Optimizations

### Location Warmth

When cutting over to a secondary, the storage controller will wait for it to
become "warm" (i.e. download enough of the tenants data). This means that some
reconciliations can take significantly longer than others and hold up precious
reconciliations units. As an optimization, the drain stage can only cut over
tenants that are already "warm". Similarly, the fill stage can prioritise the
"warmest" tenants in the fill.

Given that the number of tenants by the storage controller will be fairly low
for the foreseable future, the first implementation could simply query the tenants
for secondary status. This doesn't scale well with increasing tenant counts, so
eventually we will need new pageserver API endpoints to report the sets of
"warm" and "cold" nodes.

## Alternatives Considered

### Draining and Filling Purely as Scheduling Constraints

At its core, the storage controller is a big background loop that detects changes
in the environment and reacts on them. One could express draining and filling
of nodes purely in terms of constraining the scheduler (as opposed to having
such background tasks).

While theoretically nice, I think that's harder to implement and more importantly operate and reason about.
Consider cancellation of a drain/fill operation. We would have to update the scheduler state, create
an entirely new schedule (intent state) and start work on applying that. It gets trickier if we wish
to cancel the reconciliation tasks spawned by drain/fill nodes. How would we know which ones belong
to the conceptual drain/fill? One could add labels to reconciliations, but it gets messy in my opinion.

It would also mean that reconciliations themselves have side effects that persist in the database
(persist something to the databse when the drain is done), which I'm not conceptually fond of.

## Proof of Concept

This RFC is accompanied by a POC which implements nearly everything mentioned here
apart from the optimizations and some of the failure handling:

# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/034-ancestor-deletion.md:

# Ancestor Timeline Deletion

Created on: 2024-02-23

Author: John Spray

# Summary

When a tenant creates a new timeline that they will treat as their 'main' history,
it is awkward to permanently retain an 'old main' timeline as its ancestor. Currently
this is necessary because it is forbidden to delete a timeline which has descendents.

A new pageserver API is proposed to 'adopt' data from a parent timeline into
one of its children, such that the link between ancestor and child can be severed,
leaving the parent in a state where it may then be deleted.

# Motivation

Retaining parent timelines currently has two costs:

- Cognitive load on users, who have to remember which is the "real" main timeline.
- Storage capacity cost, as the parent timeline will retain layers up to the
  child's timeline point, even if the child fully covers its keyspace with image
  layers and will never actually read from the parent.

# Solution

A new pageserver API `PUT /v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id/detach_ancestor`
will be added. The `timeline_id` in this URL is that of the _child_ timeline that we
wish to detach from its parent.

On success, this API will leave the following state:

- The detached child timeline will no longer have an ancestor, and will contain all
  the data needed to service reads without recursing into an ancestor.
- Any other children of the parent whose timeline points were at a lower LSN than
  the detached child timeline will be modified to have the child timeline as their
  new parent.
- The parent timeline will still exist, but the child will no longer have it as an
  ancestor. If this was the last timeline that depended on the parent, then the
  parent will become deletable.

This API's implementation will consist of a series of retryable steps, such that
on failures/timeout it can safely be called again to reach the target state.

## Example

### Before

The user has "rolled back" their project to LSN X, resulting in a "new main"
timeline. The parent "old main" timeline still exists, and they would like
to clean it up.

They have two other timelines A and B. A is from before the rollback point,
and B is from after the rollback point.

```
----"old main" timeline-------X-------------------------------------------->
                |             |                         |
                |-> child A   |                         |
                              |-> "new main" timeline   |
                                                        -> child B

```

### After calling detach ancestor API

The "new main" timeline is no longer dependent on old main, and neither
is child A, because it had a branch point before X.

The user may now choose to delete child B and "old main" to get to
a pristine state. Child B is likely to be unwanted since the user
chose to roll back to X, and it branches from after X. However, we
don't assume this in the API; it is up to the user to delete it.

```
|----"old main" timeline---------------------------------------------------->
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                                         -> child B

|----"new main" timeline--------->
                 |
                 |-> child A


```

### After removing timelines

We end up with a totally clean state that leaves no trace that a rollback
ever happened: there is only one root timeline.

```
| ----"new main" timeline----------->
                |
                |-> child A


```

## Caveats

Important things for API users to bear in mind:

- this API does not delete the parent timeline: you must still do that explicitly.
- if there are other child timelines ahead of the branch point of the detached
  child, the parent won't be deletable: you must either delete or detach those
  children.
- do _not_ simply loop over all children and detach them all: this can have an
  extremely high storage cost. The detach ancestor API is intended for use on a single
  timeline to make it the new "main".
- The detach ancestor API should also not be
  exposed directly to the user as button/API, because they might decide
  to click it for all the children and thereby generate many copies of the
  parent's data -- the detach ancestor API should be used as part
  of a high level "clean up after rollback" feature.

## `detach_ancestor` API implementation

Terms used in the following sections:

- "the child": the timeline whose ID is specified in the detach ancestor API URL, also
  called "new main" in the example.
- "the parent": the parent of "the child". Also called "old main" in the example.
- "the branch point" the ancestor_lsn of "the child"

### Phase 1: write out adopted layers to S3

The child will "adopt" layers from the parent, such that its end state contains
all the parent's history as well as its own.

For all layers in the parent's layer map whose high LSN is below the branch
point, issue S3 CopyObject requests to duplicate them into the child timeline's
prefix. Do not add them to the child's layer map yet.

For delta layers in the parent's layer map which straddle the branch point, read them
and write out only content up to the branch point into new layer objects.

This is a long running operation if the parent has many layers: it should be
implemented in a way that resumes rather than restarting from scratch, if the API
times out and is called again.

As an optimization, if there are no other timelines that will be adopted into
the child, _and_ the child's image layers already full cover the branch LSN,
then we may skip adopting layers.

### Phase 2: update the child's index

Having written out all needed layers in phase 1, atomically link them all
into the child's IndexPart and upload to S3. This may be done while the
child Timeline is still running.

### Phase 3: modify timelines ancestry

Modify the child's ancestor to None, and upload its IndexPart to persist the change.

For all timelines which have the same parent as the child, and have a branch
point lower than our branch point, switch their ancestor_timeline to the child,
and upload their IndexPart to persist the change.

## Alternatives considered

### Generate full image layer on child, rather than adopting parent deltas

This would work for the case of a single child, but would prevent re-targeting
other timelines that depended on the parent. If we detached many children this
way, the storage cost would become prohibitive (consider a 1TB database with
100 child timelines: it would cost 100TiB if they all generated their own image layers).

### Don't rewrite anything: just fake it in the API

We could add a layer of indirection that let a child "pretend" that it had no
ancestor, when in reality it still had the parent. The pageserver API could
accept deletion of ancestor timelines, and just update child metadata to make
them look like they have no ancestor.

This would not achieve the desired reduction in storage cost, and may well be more
complex to maintain than simply implementing the API described in this RFC.

### Avoid copying objects: enable child index to use parent layers directly

We could teach IndexPart to store a TimelineId for each layer, such that a child
timeline could reference a parent's layers directly, rather than copying them
into the child's prefix.

This would impose a cost for the normal case of indices that only target the
timeline's own layers, add complexity, and break the useful simplifying
invariant that timelines "own" their own path. If child timelines were
referencing layers from the parent, we would have to ensure that the parent
never runs GC/compaction again, which would make the API less flexible (the
proposal in this RFC enables deletion of the parent but doesn't require it.)

## Performance

### Adopting layers

- CopyObject is a relatively cheap operation, but we may need to issue tens of thousands
  of such requests: this can take up to tens of seconds and will compete for RemoteStorage
  semaphore units with other activity on the pageserver.
- If we are running on storage backend that doesn't implement CopyObject, then
  this part will be much more expensive as we would stream all layer content
  through the pageserver. This is no different to issuing a lot
  of reads to a timeline that does not have a warm local cache: it will move
  a lot of gigabytes, but that shouldn't break anything.
- Generating truncated layers for delta that straddle the branch point will
  require streaming read/write of all the layers in question.

### Updating timeline ancestry

The simplest way to update timeline ancestry will probably be to stop and start
all the Timeline objects: this is preferable to the complexity of making their
ancestry mutable at runtime.

There will be a corresponding "stutter" in the availability of the timelines,
of the order 10-100ms, which is the time taken to upload their IndexPart, and
restart the Timeline.

# Interaction with other features

## Concurrent timeline creation

If new historic timelines are created using the parent as an ancestor while the
detach ancestor API is running, they will not be re-parented to the child. This
doesn't break anything, but it leaves the parent in a state where it might not
be possible to delete it.

Since timeline creations are an explicit user action, this is not something we need to
worry about as the storage layer: a user who wants to delete their parent timeline will not create
new children, and if they do, they can choose to delete those children to
enable deleting the parent.

For the least surprise to the user, before starting the detach ancestor branch
operation, the control plane should wait until all branches are created and not
allow any branches to be created before the branch point on the ancestor branch
while the operation is ongoing.

## WAL based disaster recovery

WAL based disaster recovery currently supports only restoring of the main
branch. Enabling WAL based disaster recovery in the future requires that we
keep a record which timeline generated the WAL and at which LSN was a parent
detached. Keep a list of timeline ids and the LSN in which they were detached in
the `index_part.json`. Limit the size of the list to 100 first entries, after
which the WAL disaster recovery will not be possible.

## Sharded tenants

For sharded tenants, calls to the detach ancestor API will pass through the storage
controller, which will handle them the same as timeline creations: invoke first
on shard zero, and then on all the other shards.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/035-safekeeper-dynamic-membership-change.md:

# Safekeeper dynamic membership change

To quickly recover from safekeeper node failures and do rebalancing we need to
be able to change set of safekeepers the timeline resides on. The procedure must
be safe (not lose committed log) regardless of safekeepers and compute state. It
should be able to progress if any majority of old safekeeper set, any majority
of new safekeeper set and compute are up and connected. This is known as a
consensus membership change. It always involves two phases: 1) switch old
majority to old + new configuration, preventing commits without acknowledge from
the new set 2) bootstrap the new set by ensuring majority of the new set has all
data which ever could have been committed before the first phase completed;
after that switch is safe to finish. Without two phases switch to the new set
which quorum might not intersect with quorum of the old set (and typical case of
ABC -> ABD switch is an example of that, because quorums AC and BD don't
intersect). Furthermore, procedure is typically carried out by the consensus
leader, and so enumeration of configurations which establishes order between
them is done through consensus log.

In our case consensus leader is compute (walproposer), and we don't want to wake
up all computes for the change. Neither we want to fully reimplement the leader
logic second time outside compute. Because of that the proposed algorithm relies
for issuing configurations on the external fault tolerant (distributed) strongly
consisent storage with simple API: CAS (compare-and-swap) on the single key.
Properly configured postgres suits this.

In the system consensus is implemented at the timeline level, so algorithm below
applies to the single timeline.

## Algorithm

### Definitions

A configuration is

```
struct Configuration {
    generation: Generation, // a number uniquely identifying configuration
    sk_set: Vec<NodeId>, // current safekeeper set
    new_sk_set: Optional<Vec<NodeId>>,
}
```

Configuration with `new_set` present is used for the intermediate step during
the change and called joint configuration. Generations establish order of
generations: we say `c1` is higher than `c2` if `c1.generation` >
`c2.generation`.

### Persistently stored data changes

Safekeeper starts storing its current configuration in the control file. Update
of is atomic, so in-memory value always matches the persistent one.

External CAS providing storage (let's call it configuration storage here) also
stores configuration for each timeline. It is initialized with generation 1 and
initial set of safekeepers during timeline creation. Executed CAS on it must
never be lost.

### Compute <-> safekeeper protocol changes

`ProposerGreeting` message carries walproposer's configuration if it is already
established (see below), else null.  `AcceptorGreeting` message carries
safekeeper's current `Configuration`. All further messages (`VoteRequest`,
`VoteResponse`, `ProposerElected`, `AppendRequest`, `AppendResponse`) carry
generation number, of walproposer in case of wp->sk message or of safekeeper in
case of sk->wp message.

### Safekeeper changes

Basic rule: once safekeeper observes configuration higher than his own it
immediately switches to it. It must refuse all messages with lower generation
that his. It also refuses messages if it is not member of the current generation
(that is, of either `sk_set` of `sk_new_set`), though it is likely not unsafe to
process them (walproposer should ignore result anyway).

If there is non null configuration in `ProposerGreeting` and it is higher than
current safekeeper one, safekeeper switches to it.

Safekeeper sends its current configuration in its first message to walproposer
`AcceptorGreeting`. It refuses all other walproposer messages if the
configuration generation in them is less than its current one. Namely, it
refuses to vote, to truncate WAL in `handle_elected` and to accept WAL. In
response it sends its current configuration generation to let walproposer know.

Safekeeper gets `PUT /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/timelines/{timeline_id}/configuration` 
accepting `Configuration`. Safekeeper switches to the given conf it is higher than its
current one and ignores it otherwise. In any case it replies with
```
struct ConfigurationSwitchResponse {
    conf: Configuration,
    term: Term,
    last_log_term: Term,
    flush_lsn: Lsn,
}
```

### Compute (walproposer) changes

Basic rule is that joint configuration requires votes from majorities in the
both `set` and `new_sk_set`.

Compute receives list of safekeepers to connect to from the control plane as
currently and tries to communicate with all of them. However, the list does not
define consensus members. Instead, on start walproposer tracks highest
configuration it receives from `AcceptorGreeting`s. Once it assembles greetings
from majority of `sk_set` and majority of `new_sk_set` (if it is present), it
establishes this configuration as its own and moves to voting. 

It should stop talking to safekeepers not listed in the configuration at this
point, though it is not unsafe to continue doing so.

To be elected it must receive votes from both majorites if `new_sk_set` is present.
Similarly, to commit WAL it must receive flush acknowledge from both majorities.

If walproposer hears from safekeeper configuration higher than his own (i.e.
refusal to accept due to configuration change) it simply restarts.

### Change algorithm

The following algorithm can be executed anywhere having access to configuration
storage and safekeepers. It is safe to interrupt / restart it and run multiple
instances of it concurrently, though likely one of them won't make
progress then. It accepts `desired_set: Vec<NodeId>` as input. 

Algorithm will refuse to make the change if it encounters previous interrupted
change attempt, but in this case it will try to finish it.

It will eventually converge if old majority, new majority and configuration
storage are reachable.

1) Fetch current timeline configuration from the configuration storage.
2) If it is already joint one and `new_set` is different from `desired_set`
   refuse to change. However, assign join conf to (in memory) var
   `join_conf` and proceed to step 4 to finish the ongoing change.
3) Else, create joint `joint_conf: Configuration`: increment current conf number
   `n` and put `desired_set` to `new_sk_set`. Persist it in the configuration
   storage by doing CAS on the current generation: change happens only if
   current configuration number is still `n`. Apart from guaranteeing uniqueness
   of configurations, CAS linearizes them, ensuring that new configuration is
   created only following the previous one when we know that the transition is
   safe. Failed CAS aborts the procedure.
4) Call `PUT` `configuration` on safekeepers from the current set,
   delivering them `joint_conf`. Collecting responses from majority is required
   to proceed. If any response returned generation higher than 
   `joint_conf.generation`, abort (another switch raced us). Otherwise, choose
   max `<last_log_term, flush_lsn>` among responses and establish it as
   (in memory) `sync_position`. Also choose max `term` and establish it as (in
   memory) `sync_term`. We can't finish the switch until majority of the new set
   catches up to this `sync_position` because data before it could be committed
   without ack from the new set. Similarly, we'll bump term on new majority
   to `sync_term` so that two computes with the same term are never elected.
4) Initialize timeline on safekeeper(s) from `new_sk_set` where it
   doesn't exist yet by doing `pull_timeline` from the majority of the 
   current set. Doing that on majority of `new_sk_set` is enough to
   proceed, but it is reasonable to ensure that all `new_sk_set` members
   are initialized -- if some of them are down why are we migrating there?
5) Call `POST` `bump_term(sync_term)` on safekeepers from the new set. 
   Success on majority is enough.
6) Repeatedly call `PUT` `configuration` on safekeepers from the new set,
   delivering them `joint_conf` and collecting their positions. This will
   switch them to the `joint_conf` which generally won't be needed 
   because `pull_timeline` already includes it and plus additionally would be
   broadcast by compute. More importantly, we may proceed to the next step
   only when `<last_log_term, flush_lsn>` on the majority of the new set reached 
   `sync_position`. Similarly, on the happy path no waiting is not needed because 
   `pull_timeline` already includes it. However, we should double
    check to be safe. For example, timeline could have been created earlier e.g.
    manually or after try-to-migrate, abort, try-to-migrate-again sequence. 
7) Create `new_conf: Configuration` incrementing `join_conf` generation and having new 
   safekeeper set as `sk_set` and None `new_sk_set`. Write it to configuration 
   storage under one more CAS.
8) Call `PUT` `configuration` on safekeepers from the new set,
   delivering them `new_conf`. It is enough to deliver it to the majority 
   of the new set; the rest can be updated by compute.

I haven't put huge effort to make the description above very precise, because it
is natural language prone to interpretations anyway. Instead I'd like to make TLA+
spec of it.

Description above focuses on safety. To make the flow practical and live, here a few more 
considerations.
1) It makes sense to ping new set to ensure it we are migrating to live node(s) before 
  step 3.
2) If e.g. accidentally wrong new sk set has been specified, before CAS in step `6` is completed 
   it is safe to rollback to the old conf with one more CAS.
3) On step 4 timeline might be already created on members of the new set for various reasons; 
   the simplest is the procedure restart. There are more complicated scenarious like mentioned
   in step 5. Deleting and re-doing `pull_timeline` is generally unsafe without involving 
   generations, so seems simpler to treat existing timeline as success. However, this also 
   has a disadvantage: you might imagine an surpassingly unlikely schedule where condition in
   the step 5 is never reached until compute is (re)awaken up to synchronize new member(s).
   I don't think we'll observe this in practice, but can add waking up compute if needed.
4) In the end timeline should be locally deleted on the safekeeper(s) which are
   in the old set but not in the new one, unless they are unreachable. To be
   safe this also should be done under generation number (deletion proceeds only if 
   current configuration is <= than one in request and safekeeper is not memeber of it).
5) If current conf fetched on step 1 is already not joint and members equal to `desired_set`,
   jump to step 7, using it as `new_conf`.

## Implementation

The procedure ought to be driven from somewhere. Obvious candidates are control
plane and storage_controller; and as each of them already has db we don't want
yet another storage. I propose to manage safekeepers in storage_controller
because 1) since it is in rust it simplifies simulation testing (more on this
below) 2) it already manages pageservers. 

This assumes that migration will be fully usable only after we migrate all
tenants/timelines to storage_controller. It is discussible whether we want also
to manage pageserver attachments for all of these, but likely we do.

This requires us to define storcon <-> cplane interface.

### storage_controller <-> control plane interface

First of all, control plane should
[change](https://neondb.slack.com/archives/C03438W3FLZ/p1719226543199829)
storing safekeepers per timeline instead of per tenant because we can't migrate
tenants atomically. 

The important question is how updated configuration is delivered from
storage_controller to control plane to provide it to computes. As always, there
are two options, pull and push. Let's do it the same push as with pageserver
`/notify-attach` because 1) it keeps storage_controller out of critical compute
start path 2) provides easier upgrade: there won't be such a thing as 'timeline
managed by control plane / storcon', cplane just takes the value out of its db
when needed 3) uniformity. It makes storage_controller responsible for retrying notifying
control plane until it succeeds.

So, cplane `/notify-safekeepers` for the timeline accepts `Configuration` and
updates it in the db if the provided conf generation is higher (the cplane db
should also store generations for this). Similarly to [`/notify-attach`](https://www.notion.so/neondatabase/Storage-Controller-Control-Plane-interface-6de56dd310a043bfa5c2f5564fa98365), it
should update db which makes the call successful, and then try to schedule
`apply_config` if possible, it is ok if not. storage_controller 
should rate limit calling the endpoint, but likely this won't be needed, as migration
throughput is limited by `pull_timeline`.

Timeline (branch) creation in cplane should call storage_controller POST
`tenant/:tenant_id/timeline` like it currently does for sharded tenants.
Response should be augmented with `safekeeper_conf: Configuration`. The call
should be retried until succeeds.

Timeline deletion and tenant deletion in cplane should call appropriate
storage_controller endpoints like it currently does for sharded tenants. The
calls should be retried until they succeed.

### storage_controller implementation

Current 'load everything on startup and keep in memory' easy design is fine.
Single timeline shouldn't take more than 100 bytes (it's 16 byte tenant_id, 16
byte timeline_id, int generation, vec of ~3 safekeeper ids plus some flags), so
10^6 of timelines shouldn't take more than 100MB.

Similar to pageserver attachment Intents storage_controller would have in-memory
`MigrationRequest` (or its absense) for each timeline and pool of tasks trying
to make these request reality; this ensures one instance of storage_controller
won't do several migrations on the same timeline concurrently. In the first
version it is simpler to have more manual control and no retries, i.e. migration
failure removes the request. Later we can build retries and automatic
scheduling/migration. `MigrationRequest` is
```
enum MigrationRequest {
    To(Vec<NodeId>),
    FinishPending,
}
```

`FinishPending` requests to run the procedure to ensure state is clean: current
configuration is not joint and majority of safekeepers are aware of it, but do
not attempt to migrate anywhere. If current configuration fetched on step 1 is
not joint it jumps to step 7. It should be run at startup for all timelines (but
similarly, in the first version it is ok to trigger it manually).

#### Schema

`safekeepers` table mirroring current `nodes` should be added, except that for
`scheduling_policy` field (seems like `status` is a better name for it): it is enough
to have at least in the beginning only 3 fields: 1) `active` 2) `offline` 3)
`decomissioned`.

`timelines` table:
```
table! {
    // timeline_id is primary key
    timelines (tenant_id, timeline_id) {
        timeline_id -> Varchar,
        tenant_id -> Varchar,
        generation -> Int4,
        sk_set -> Array<Int4>, // list of safekeeper ids
        new_sk_set -> Nullable<Array<Int4>>, // list of safekeeper ids, null if not joint conf
        cplane_notified_generation -> Int4,
    }
}
```

#### API

Node management is similar to pageserver:
1) POST `/control/v1/safekeepers` upserts safekeeper.
2) GET `/control/v1/safekeepers` lists safekeepers.
3) GET `/control/v1/safekeepers/:node_id` gets safekeeper.
4) PUT `/control/v1/safekepers/:node_id/status` changes status to e.g.
   `offline` or `decomissioned`. Initially it is simpler not to schedule any
    migrations here.

Safekeeper deploy scripts should register safekeeper at storage_contorller as
they currently do with cplane, under the same id.

Timeline creation/deletion: already existing POST `tenant/:tenant_id/timeline`
would 1) choose initial set of safekeepers; 2) write to the db initial
`Configuration` with `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` returning existing row in
case of conflict; 3) create timeline on the majority of safekeepers (already
created is ok).

We don't want to block timeline creation when one safekeeper is down. Currently
this is solved by compute implicitly creating timeline on any safekeeper it is
connected to. This creates ugly timeline state on safekeeper when timeline is
created, but start LSN is not defined yet. It would be nice to remove this; to
do that, controller can in the background retry to create timeline on
safekeeper(s) which missed that during initial creation call. It can do that
through `pull_timeline` from majority so it doesn't need to remember
`parent_lsn` in its db.

Timeline deletion removes the row from the db and forwards deletion to the
current configuration members. Without additional actions deletions might leak,
see below on this; initially let's ignore these, reporting to cplane success if
at least one safekeeper deleted the timeline (this will remove s3 data).

Tenant deletion repeats timeline deletion for all timelines.

Migration API: the first version is the simplest and the most imperative:
1) PUT `/control/v1/safekeepers/migrate` schedules `MigrationRequest`s to move
all timelines from one safekeeper to another. It accepts json
```
{
    "src_sk": u32,
    "dst_sk": u32,
    "limit": Optional<u32>,
}
```

Returns list of scheduled requests.

2) PUT `/control/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id/safekeeper_migrate` schedules `MigrationRequest`
   to move single timeline to given set of safekeepers:
```
{
    "desired_set": Vec<u32>,
}
```

Returns scheduled request.

Similar call should be added for the tenant.

It would be great to have some way of subscribing to the results (apart from
looking at logs/metrics).

Migration is executed as described above. One subtlety is that (local) deletion on
source safekeeper might fail, which is not a problem if we are going to
decomission the node but leaves garbage otherwise. I'd propose in the first version
1) Don't attempt deletion at all if node status is `offline`.
2) If it failed, just issue warning.
And add PUT `/control/v1/safekeepers/:node_id/scrub` endpoint which would find and 
remove garbage timelines for manual use. It will 1) list all timelines on the 
safekeeper 2) compare each one against configuration storage: if timeline 
doesn't exist at all (had been deleted), it can be deleted. Otherwise, it can 
be deleted under generation number if node is not member of current generation.

Automating this is untrivial; we'd need to register all potential missing
deletions <tenant_id, timeline_id, generation, node_id> in the same transaction
which switches configurations. Similarly when timeline is fully deleted to
prevent cplane operation from blocking when some safekeeper is not available
deletion should be also registered.

One more task pool should infinitely retry notifying control plane about changed
safekeeper sets.

3) GET `/control/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id/` should return
   current in memory state of the timeline and pending `MigrationRequest`,
   if any.

4) PUT `/control/v1/tenant/:tenant_id/timeline/:timeline_id/safekeeper_migrate_abort` tries to abort the
   migration by switching configuration from the joint to the one with (previous) `sk_set` under CAS
   (incrementing generation as always).

#### Dealing with multiple instances of storage_controller

Operations described above executed concurrently might create some errors but do
not prevent progress, so while we normally don't want to run multiple instances
of storage_controller it is fine to have it temporarily, e.g. during redeploy.

Any interactions with db update in-memory controller state, e.g. if migration
request failed because different one is in progress, controller remembers that
and tries to finish it.

## Testing

`neon_local` should be switched to use storage_controller, playing role of
control plane.

There should be following layers of tests:
1) Model checked TLA+ spec specifies the algorithm and verifies its basic safety.

2) To cover real code and at the same time test many schedules we should have
   simulation tests. For that, configuration storage, storage_controller <->
   safekeeper communication and pull_timeline need to be mocked and main switch
   procedure wrapped to as a node (thread) in simulation tests, using these
   mocks. Test would inject migrations like it currently injects
   safekeeper/walproposer restars. Main assert is the same -- committed WAL must
   not be lost.

3) Since simulation testing injects at relatively high level points (not
   syscalls), it omits some code, in particular `pull_timeline`. Thus it is
   better to have basic tests covering whole system as well. Extended version of
   `test_restarts_under_load` would do: start background load and do migration 
   under it, then restart endpoint and check that no reported commits 
   had been lost. I'd also add one more creating classic network split scenario, with
   one compute talking to AC and another to BD while migration from nodes ABC to ABD
   happens.

4) Simple e2e test should ensure that full flow including cplane notification works.

## Order of implementation and rollout

Note that 
- Control plane parts and integration with it is fully independent from everything else
  (tests would use simulation and neon_local).
- There is a lot of infra work making storage_controller aware of timelines and safekeepers
  and its impl/rollout should be separate from migration itself.
- Initially walproposer can just stop working while it observers joint configuration.
  Such window would be typically very short anyway.

To rollout smoothly, both walproposer and safekeeper should have flag
`configurations_enabled`; when set to false, they would work as currently, i.e.
walproposer is able to commit on whatever safekeeper set it is provided. Until
all timelines are managed by storcon we'd need to use current script to migrate
and update/drop entries in the storage_controller database if it has any.

Safekeepers would need to be able to talk both current and new protocol version
with compute to reduce number of computes restarted in prod once v2 protocol is
deployed (though before completely switching we'd need to force this).

Let's have the following rollout order:
- storage_controller becomes aware of safekeepers;
- storage_controller gets timeline creation for new timelines and deletion requests, but
  doesn't manage all timelines yet. Migration can be tested on these new timelines.
  To keep control plane and storage_controller databases in sync while control 
  plane still chooses the safekeepers initially (until all timelines are imported
  it can choose better), `TimelineCreateRequest` can get optional safekeepers
  field with safekeepers chosen by cplane.
- Then we can import all existing timelines from control plane to
  storage_controller and gradually enable configurations region by region.


Very rough implementation order:
- Add concept of configurations to safekeepers (including control file),
  implement v3 protocol.
- Implement walproposer changes, including protocol.
- Implement storconn part. Use it in neon_local (and pytest).
- Make cplane store safekeepers per timeline instead of per tenant.
- Implement cplane/storcon integration. Route branch creation/deletion 
  through storcon. Then we can test migration of new branches.
- Finally import existing branches. Then we can drop cplane 
  safekeeper selection code. Gradually enable configurations at 
  computes and safekeepers. Before that, all computes must talk only
  v3 protocol version.

## Integration with evicted timelines

Currently, `pull_timeline` doesn't work correctly with evicted timelines because
copy would point to original partial file. To fix let's just do s3 copy of the
file. It is a bit stupid as generally unnecessary work, but it makes sense to
implement proper migration before doing smarter timeline archival. [Issue](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/8542)

## Possible optimizations

Steps above suggest walproposer restart (with re-election) and thus reconnection
to safekeepers. Since by bumping term on new majority we ensure that leader
terms are unique even across generation switches it is possible to preserve
connections. However, it is more complicated, reconnection is very fast and it
is much more important to avoid compute restart than millisecond order of write
stall.

Multiple joint consensus: algorithm above rejects attempt to change membership
while another attempt is in progress. It is possible to overlay them and AFAIK
Aurora does this but similarly I don't think this is needed.

## Misc

We should use Compute <-> safekeeper protocol change to include other (long
yearned) modifications:
- send data in network order to make arm work.
- remove term_start_lsn from AppendRequest
- add horizon to TermHistory
- add to ProposerGreeting number of connection from this wp to sk


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/035-timeline-archive.md:

# Timeline Archival

## Summary

This RFC describes a mechanism for pageservers to eliminate local storage + compute work
for timelines which are not in use, in response to external API calls to "archive" a timeline.

The archived state roughly corresponds to fully offloading a timeline to object storage, such
that its cost is purely the cost of that object storage.

## Motivation

Archived timelines serve multiple purposes:
- Act as a 'snapshot' for workloads that would like to retain restorable copies of their
  database from longer ago than their PITR window.
- Enable users to create huge numbers of branches (e.g. one per github PR) without having
  to diligently clean them up later to avoid overloading the pageserver (currently we support
  up to ~500 branches per tenant).

### Prior art

Most storage and database systems have some form of snapshot, which can be implemented several ways:
1. full copies of data (e.g. an EBS snapshot to S3)
2. shallow snapshots which are CoW relative to the original version of the data, e.g. on a typical NFS appliance, or a filesystem like CephFS.
3. a series of snapshots which are CoW or de-duplicated relative to one another.

Today's Neon branches are approximately like `2.`, although due to implementation details branches
often end up storing much more data than they really need, as parent branches assume that all data
at the branch point is needed.  The layers pinned in the parent branch may have a much larger size
than the physical size of a compressed image layer representing the data at the branch point.

## Requirements

- Enter & exit the archived state in response to external admin API calls
- API calls to modify the archived state are atomic and durable
- An archived timeline should eventually (once out of PITR window) use an efficient compressed
  representation, and avoid retaining arbitrarily large data in its parent branch.
- Remote object GETs during tenant start may be O(N) with the number of _active_ branches,
  but must not scale with the number of _archived_ branches.
- Background I/O for archived branches should only be done a limited number of times to evolve them
  to a long-term-efficient state (e.g. rewriting to image layers).  There should be no ongoing "housekeeping"
  overhead for archived branches, including operations related to calculating sizes for billing.
- The pageserver should put no load on the safekeeper for archived branches.
- Performance of un-archiving a branch must make good use of S3/disk bandwidth to restore the branch
  to a performant state in a short time (linear with the branch's logical size)

## Non Goals

- Archived branches are not a literal `fullbackup` postgres snapshot: they are still stored
  in Neon's internal format.
- Compute cold starts after activating an archived branch will not have comparable performance to
  cold starts on an active branch.
- Archived branches will not use any new/additional compression or de-duplication beyond what
  is already implemented for image layers (zstd per page).
- The pageserver will not "auto start" archived branches in response to page_service API requests: they
  are only activated explicitly via the HTTP API.
- We will not implement a total offload of archived timelines from safekeepers: their control file (small) will
  remain on local disk, although existing eviction mechanisms will remove any segments from local disk.
- We will not expose any prometheus metrics for archived timelines, or make them visible in any
  detailed HTTP APIs other than the specific API for listing archived timelines.
- A parent branch may not be archived unless all its children are.

## Impacted Components

pageserver, storage controller

## Terminology

**Archived**: a branch is _archived_ when an HTTP API request to archive it has succeeded: the caller
may assume that this branch is now very cheap to store, although this may not be physically so until the
branch proceeds to the offloaded state.

**Active** branches are branches which are available for use by page_service clients, and have a relatively
high cost due to consuming local storage.

**Offloaded** branches are a subset of _archived_ branches, which have had their local state removed such
that they now consume minimal runtime resources and have a cost similar to the cost of object storage.

**Activate** (verb): transition from Archived to Active

**Archive** (verb): transition from Active to Archived

**Offload** (verb): transition from Archived to Offloaded

**Offload manifest**: an object stored in S3 that describes timelines which pageservers do not load.

**Warm up** (verb): operation done on an active branch, by downloading its active layers.  Once a branch is
warmed up, good performance will be available to page_service clients.

## Implementation

### High level flow

We may think of a timeline which is archived and then activated as proceeding through a series of states:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
  [*] --> Active(warm)
  Active(warm) --> Archived
  Archived --> Offloaded
  Archived --> Active(warm)
  Offloaded --> Active(cold)
  Active(cold) --> Active(warm)
```

Note that the transition from Archived to Active(warm) is expected to be fairly rare: the most common lifecycles
of branches will be:
- Very frequent: Short lived branches: Active -> Deleted
- Frequent: Long-lived branches: Active -> Archived -> Offloaded -> Deleted
- Rare: Branches used to restore old state: Active ->Archived -> Offloaded -> Active

These states are _not_ all stored as a single physical state on the timeline, but rather represent the combination
of:
- the timeline's lifecycle state: active or archived, stored in the timeline's index
- its offload state: whether pageserver has chosen to drop local storage of the timeline and write it into the
  manifest of offloaded timelines.
- cache state (whether it's warm or cold).

### Storage format changes

There are two storage format changes:
1. `index_part.json` gets a new attribute `state` that describes whether the timeline is to
   be considered active or archived.
2. A new tenant-level _manifest_ object `tenant_manifest-v1.json` describes which timelines a tenant does not need to load
   at startup (and is available for storing other small, rarely changing tenant-wide attributes in future)

The manifest object will have a format like this:
```
{
  "offload_timelines": [
    {
      "timeline_id": ...
      "last_record_lsn": ...
      "last_record_lsn_time": ...
      "pitr_interval": ...
      "last_gc_lsn": ...  # equal to last_record_lsn if this branch has no history (i.e. a snapshot)
      "logical_size": ...  # The size at last_record_lsn
      "physical_size" ...
      "parent": Option<{
        "timeline_id"...
        "lsn"... # Branch point LSN on the parent
        "requires_data": bool # True if this branch depends on layers in its parent, identify it here

      }>
    }
  ]
}
```

The information about a timeline in its offload state is intentionally minimal: just enough to decide:
- Whether it requires [archive optimization](#archive-branch-optimization) by rewriting as a set of image layers: we may infer this
  by checking if now > last_record_lsn_time - pitr_interval, and pitr_lsn < last_record_lsn.
- Whether a parent branch should include this offloaded branch in its GC inputs to avoid removing
  layers that the archived branch depends on
- Whether requests to delete this `timeline_id` should be executed (i.e. if a deletion request
  is received for a timeline_id that isn't in the site of live `Timelines` or in the manifest, then
  we don't need to go to S3 for the deletion.
- How much archived space to report in consumption metrics

The contents of the manifest's offload list will also be stored as an attribute of `Tenant`, such that the total
set of timelines may be found by the union of `Tenant::timelines` (non-offloaded timelines) and `Tenant::offloaded`
(offloaded timelines).

For split-brain protection, the manifest object will be written with a generation suffix, in the same way as
index_part objects are (see [generation numbers RFC](025-generation-numbers.md)).  This will add some complexity, but
give us total safety against two pageservers with the same tenant attached fighting over the object.  Existing code
for finding the latest generation and for cleaning up old generations (in the scrubber) will be generalized to cover
the manifest file.

### API & Timeline state

Timelines will store a lifecycle state (enum of Active or Archived) in their IndexPart.  This will
be controlled by a new per-timeline `configure` endpoint.  This is intentionally generic naming, which
may be used in future to control other per-timeline attributes (e.g. in future we may make PITR interval
a per-timeline configuration).

`PUT /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/timelines/{timeline_id}/configure`
```
{
  'state': 'active|archive'
}
```

When archiving a timeline, this API will complete as soon as the timeline's state has been set in index_part, and that index has been uploaded.

When activating a timeline, this API will complete as soon as the timeline's state has been set in index_part,
**and** the `Timeline` object has been instantiated and activated.  This will require reading the timeline's
index, but not any data: it should be about as fast as a couple of small S3 requests.

The API will be available with identical path via the storage controller: calling this on a sharded tenant
will simply map the API call to all the shards.

Archived timelines may never have descendent timelines which are active.  This will be enforced at the API level,
such that activating a timeline requires that all its ancestors are active, and archiving a timeline requires
that all its descendents are archived.  It is the callers responsibility to walk the hierarchy of timelines
in the proper order if they would like to archive whole trees of branches.

Because archive timelines will be excluded from the usual timeline listing APIs, a new API specifically
for archived timelines will be added: this is for use in support/debug:

```
GET /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/archived_timelines

{
  ...same per-timeline content as the tenant manifest...
}

```

### Tenant attach changes

Currently, during Tenant::spawn we list all the timelines in the S3 bucket, and then for each timeline
we load their index_part.json.  To avoid the number of GETs scaling linearly with the number of archived
timelines, we must have a single object that tells us which timelines do not need to be loaded.  The
number of ListObjects requests while listing timelines will still scale O(N), but this is less problematic
because each request covers 1000 timelines.

This is **not** literally the same as the set of timelines who have state=archived.  Rather, it is
the set of timelines which have been offloaded in the background after their state was set to archived.

We may simply skip loading these timelines: there will be no special state of `Timeline`, they just won't
exist from the perspective of an active `Tenant` apart from in deletion: timeline deletion will need
to check for offloaded timelines as well as active timelines, to avoid wrongly returning 404 on trying
to delete an offloaded timeline.

### Warm-up API

`PUT /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/timelines/{timeline_id}/download?wait_ms=1234`

This API will be similar to the existing `download_remote_layers` API, but smarter:
- It will not download _all_ remote layers, just the visible set (i.e. layers needed for a read)
- It will download layers in the visible set until reaching `wait_ms`, then return a struct describing progress
  of downloads, so that the caller can poll.

The _visible set_ mentioned above will be calculated by the pageserver in the background, by taking the set
of readable LSNs (i.e. branch points and heads of branches), and walking the layer map to work out which layers
can possibly be read from these LSNs.  This concept of layer visibility is more generally useful for cache
eviction and heatmaps, as well as in this specific case of warming up a timeline.

The caller does not have to wait for the warm up API, or call it at all.  But it is strongly advised
to call it, because otherwise populating local contents for a timeline can take a long time when waiting
for SQL queries to coincidentally hit all the layers, and during that time query latency remains quite
volatile.

### Background work

Archived branches are not subject to normal compaction.  Instead, when the compaction loop encounters
an archived branch, it will consider rewriting the branch to just image layers if the branch has no history
([archive branch optimization](#archive-branch-optimization)), or offloading the timeline from local disk
if its state permits that.

Additionally, the tenant compaction task will walk the state of already offloaded timelines to consider
optimizing their storage, e.g. if a timeline had some history when offloaded, but since then its PITR
has elapsed and it can now be rewritten to image layers.

#### Archive branch offload

Recall that when we archive a timeline via the HTTP API, this only sets a state: it doesn't do
any actual work.

This work is done in the background compaction loop.  It makes sense to tag this work on to the compaction
loop, because it is spiritually aligned: offloading data for archived branches improves storage efficiency.

The condition for offload is simple:
 - a `Timeline` object exists with state `Archived`
 - the timeline does not have any non-offloaded children.
 
 Regarding the condition that children must be offloaded, this will always be eventually true, because
 we enforce at the API level that children of archived timelines must themselves be archived, and all
 archived timelines will eventually be offloaded.

Offloading a timeline is simple:
- Read the timeline's attributes that we will store in its offloaded state (especially its logical size)
- Call `shutdown()` on the timeline and remove it from the `Tenant` (as if we were about to delete it)
- Erase all the timeline's content from local storage (`remove_dir_all` on its path)
- Write the tenant manifest to S3 to prevent this timeline being loaded on next start.

#### Archive branch optimization (flattening)

When we offloaded a branch, it might have had some history that prevented rewriting it to a single
point in time set of image layers.  For example, a branch might have several days of writes and a 7
day PITR: when we archive it, it still has those days of history.

Once the PITR has expired, we have an opportunity to reduce the physical footprint of the branch by:
- Writing compressed image layers within the archived branch, as these are more efficient as a way of storing
  a point in time compared with delta layers
- Updating the branch's offload metadata to indicate that this branch no longer depends on its ancestor
  for data, i.e. the ancestor is free to GC layers files at+below the branch point

Fully compacting an archived branch into image layers at a single LSN may be thought of as *flattening* the
branch, such that it is now a one-dimensional keyspace rather than a two-dimensional key/lsn space. It becomes
a true snapshot at that LSN.

It is not always more efficient to flatten a branch than to keep some extra history on the parent: this
is described in more detail in [optimizations](#delaying-storage-optimization-if-retaining-parent-layers-is-cheaper)

Archive branch optimization should be done _before_ background offloads during compaction, because there may
be timelines which are ready to be offloaded but also would benefit from the optimization step before
being offloaded.  For example, a branch which has already fallen out of PITR window and has no history
of its own may be immediately re-written as a series of image layers before being offloaded.

### Consumption metrics

Archived timelines and offloaded timelines will be excluded from the synthetic size calculation, in anticipating
that billing structures based on consumption metrics are highly likely to apply different $/GB rates to archived
vs. ordinary content.

Archived and offloaded timelines' logical size will be reported under the existing `timeline_logical_size`
variant of `MetricsKey`: receivers are then free to bill on this metric as they please.

### Secondary locations

Archived timelines (including offloaded timelines) will be excluded from heatmaps, and thereby
when a timeline is archived, after the next cycle of heatmap upload & secondary download, its contents
will be dropped from secondary locations.

### Sharding

Archiving or activating a timeline will be done symmetrically across all shards in a tenant, in
the same way that timeline creation and deletion is done.  There are no special rules about ordering:
the storage controller may dispatch concurrent calls to all shards when archiving or activating a timeline.

Since consumption metrics are only transmitted from shard zero, the state of archival on this shard
will be authoritative for consumption metrics.

## Error cases

### Errors in sharded tenants

If one shard in a tenant fails an operation but others succeed, the tenant may end up in a mixed
state, where a timeline is archived on some shards but not on others.  

We will not bother implementing a rollback mechanism for this: errors in archiving/activating a timeline
are either transient (e.g. S3 unavailable, shutting down), or the fault of the caller (NotFound, BadRequest).
In the transient case callers are expected to retry until success, or to make appropriate API calls to clear
up their mistake.  We rely on this good behavior of callers to eventually get timelines into a consistent
state across all shards.  If callers do leave a timeline in an inconsistent state across shards, this doesn't
break anything, it's just "weird".

This is similar to the status quo for timeline creation and deletion: callers are expected to retry
these operations until they succeed.

### Archiving/activating

Archiving/activating a timeline can fail in a limited number of ways:
1. I/O error storing/reading the timeline's updated index
    - These errors are always retryable: a fundamental design assumption of the pageserver is that remote
      storage errors are always transient. 
2. NotFound if the timeline doesn't exist
    - Callers of the API are expected to avoid calling deletion and archival APIs concurrently.
    - The storage controller has runtime locking to prevent races such as deleting a timeline while
      archiving it.
3. BadRequest if the rules around ancestors/descendents of archived timelines would be violated
    - Callers are expected to do their own checks to avoid hitting this case.  If they make
      a mistake and encounter this error, they should give up.

### Offloading

Offloading can only fail if remote storage is unavailable, which would prevent us from writing the
tenant manifest.  In such error cases, we give up in the expectation that offloading will be tried 
again at the next iteration of the compaction loop.

### Archive branch optimization

Optimization is a special form of compaction, so can encounter all the same errors as regular compaction
can: it should return Result<(), CompactionError>, and as with compaction it will be retried on
the next iteration of the compaction loop.

## Optimizations

### Delaying storage optimization if retaining parent layers is cheaper

Optimizing archived branches to image layers and thereby enabling parent branch GC to progress
is a safe default: archived branches cannot over-fill a pageserver's local disk, and once they
are offloaded to S3 they're totally safe, inert things.

However, in some cases it can be advantageous to retain extra history on their parent branch rather
than flattening the archived branch.  For example, if a 1TB parent branch is rather slow-changing (1GB
of data per day), and archive branches are being created nightly, then writing out full 1TB image layers
for each nightly branch is inefficient compared with just keeping more history on the main branch.

Getting this right requires consideration of:
- Compaction: if keeping more history on the main branch is going to prompt the main branch's compaction to
  write out extra image layers, then it might make more sense to just write out the image layers on
  the archived branch.
- Metadata bloat: keeping extra history on a parent branch doesn't just cost GB of storage, it makes
  the layer map (and index_part) bigger.  There are practical limits beyond which writing an indefinitely
  large layer map can cause problems elsewhere.

This optimization can probably be implemented quite cheaply with some basic heuristics like:
- don't bother doing optimization on an archive branch if the LSN distance between
  its branch point and the end of the PITR window is <5% of the logical size of the archive branch.
- ...but, Don't keep more history on the main branch than double the PITR

### Creating a timeline in archived state (a snapshot)

Sometimes, one might want to create a branch with no history, which will not be written to
before it is archived.  This is a snapshot, although we do not require a special snapshot API,
since a snapshot can be represented as a timeline with no history.

This can be accomplished by simply creating a timeline and then immediately archiving it, but
that is somewhat wasteful: this timeline it will spin up various tasks and open a connection to the storage
broker to try and ingest WAL, before being shutdown in the subsequent archival call.  To explicitly
support this common special case, we may add a parameter to the timeline creation API which
creates a timeline directly into the archived state.

Such a timeline creation will do exactly two I/Os at creation time:
- write the index_part object to record the timeline's existence
- when the timeline is offloaded in the next iteration of the compaction loop (~20s later),
  write the tenant manifest.

Later, when the timeline falls off the end of the PITR interval, the usual offload logic will wake
up the 'snapshot' branch and write out image layers.

## Future Work

### Enabling `fullbackup` dumps from archive branches

It would be useful to be able to export an archive branch to another system, or for use in a local
postgres database.

This could be implemented as a general capability for all branches, in which case it would "just work"
for archive branches by activating them.  However, downloading all the layers in a branch just to generate
a fullbackup is a bit inefficient: we could implement a special case for flattened archived branches
which streams image layers from S3 and outputs the fullbackup stream without writing the layers out to disk.

Implementing `fullbackup` is a bit more complicated than this because of sharding, but solving that problem
is unrelated to the topic of archived branches (it probably involves having each shard write out a fullbackup 
stream to S3 in an intermediate format and, then having one node stitch them together).

### Tagging layers from archived branches

When we know a layer is an image layer written for an archived branch that has fallen off the PITR window,
we may add tags to the S3 objects to enable writing lifecycle policies that transition such layers to even
cheaper storage.

This could be done for all archived layers, or it could be driven by the archival API, to give the pageserver
external hints on which branches are likely to be reactivated, and which branches are good candidates for
tagging for low performance storage.

Tagging+lifecycles is just one mechanism: one might also directly use S3 storage classes.  Other clouds' object
stores have similar mechanisms.

### Storing sequences of archive branches as deltas

When archived branches are used as scheduled snapshots, we could store them even more efficiently
by encoding them as deltas relative to each other (i.e. for nightly snapshots, when we do the
storage optimization for Tuesday's snapshot, we would read Monday's snapshot and store only the modified
pages). This is the kind of encoding that many backup storage systems use.

The utility of this depends a lot on the churn rate of the data, and the cost of doing the delta encoding
vs. just writing out a simple stream of the entire database.  For smaller databases, writing out a full
copy is pretty trivial (e.g. writing a compressed copy of a 10GiB database to S3 can take under 10 seconds,
so the complexity tradeoff of diff-encoding it is dubious).

One does not necessarily have to read-back the previous snapshot in order to encoded the next one: if the
pageserver knows about the schedule, it can intentionally retain extra history on the main branch so that
we can say: "A branch exists from Monday night.  I have Monday night's data still active in the main branch,
so now I can read at the Monday LSN and the Tuesday LSN, calculate the delta, and store it as Tuesday's
delta snapshot".

Clearly this all requires careful housekeeping to retain the relationship between branches that depend on
each other: perhaps this would be done by making the archive branches have child/parent relationships with
each other, or perhaps we would permit them to remain children of their original parent, but additionally
have a relationship with the snapshot they're encoded relative to.

Activating a branch that is diff-encoded may require activating several earlier branches too, so figuring
out how frequently to write a full copy is important.  This is essentially a zoomed-out version of what
we do with delta layers and image layers within a timeline, except each "layer" is a whole timeline.


## FAQ/Alternatives

### Store all timelines in the tenant manifest

Rather than special-casing offloaded timelines in the offload manifest, we could store a total
manifest of all timelines, eliminating the need for the pageserver to list timelines in S3 on
startup.

That would be a more invasive change (require hooking in to timeline creation), and would
generate much more I/O to this manifest for tenants that had many branches _and_ frequent
create/delete cycles for short lived branches.  Restricting the manifest to offloaded timelines
means that we only have to cope with the rate at which long-lived timelines are archived, rather
than the rate at which sort lived timelines are created & destroyed.

### Automatically archiving/activating timelines without external API calls

We could implement TTL driven offload of timelines, waking them up when a page request
arrives.

This has downsides:
- Opacity: if we do TTL-driven offload inside the pageserver, then the end user doesn't
  know which of their branches are in this state, and might get a surprise when they try
  to use such a branch.
- Price fluctuation: if the archival of a branch is used in end user pricing, then users
  prefer clarity & consistency.  Ideally a branch's storage should cost the same from the moment it
  is created, rather than having a usage-dependency storage price.
- Complexity: enabling the page service to call up into the Tenant to activate a timeline
  would be awkward, compared with an external entry point.

### Make offloaded a state of Timeline

To reduce the operator-facing complexity of having some timelines APIs that only return
non-offloaded timelines, we could build the offloaded state into the Timeline type.

`timeline.rs` is already one of the most egregiously long source files in the tree, so
this is rejected on the basis that we need to avoid making that complexity worse.

# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/036-physical-replication.md:

# Physical Replication

This RFC is a bit special in that we have already implemented physical
replication a long time ago. However, we never properly wrote down all
the decisions and assumptions, and in the last months when more users
have started to use the feature, numerous issues have surfaced.

This RFC documents the design decisions that have been made.

## Summary

PostgreSQL has a feature called streaming replication, where a replica
streams WAL from the primary and continuously applies it. It is also
known as "physical replication", to distinguish it from logical
replication.  In PostgreSQL, a replica is initialized by taking a
physical backup of the primary. In Neon, the replica is initialized
from a slim "base backup" from the pageserver, just like a primary,
and the primary and the replicas connect to the same pageserver,
sharing the storage.

There are two kinds of read-only replicas in Neon:
- replicas that follow the primary, and
- "static" replicas that are pinned at a particular LSN.

A static replica is useful e.g. for performing time-travel queries and
running one-off slow queries without affecting the primary. A replica
that follows the primary can be used e.g. to scale out read-only
workloads.

## Motivation

Read-only replicas allow offloading read-only queries. It's useful for
isolation, if you want to make sure that read-only queries don't
affect the primary, and it's also an easy way to provide guaranteed
read-only access to an application, without having to mess with access
controls.

## Non Goals (if relevant)

This RFC is all about WAL-based *physical* replication. Logical
replication is a different feature.

Neon also has the capability to launch "static" read-only nodes which
do not follow the primary, but are pinned to a particular LSN. They
can be used for long-running one-off queries, or for Point-in-time
queries. They work similarly to read replicas that follow the primary,
but some things are simpler: there are no concerns about cache
invalidation when the data changes on the primary, or worrying about
transactions that are in-progress on the primary.

## Impacted components (e.g. pageserver, safekeeper, console, etc)

- Control plane launches the replica
- Replica Postgres instance connects to the safekeepers, to stream the WAL
- The primary does not know about the standby, except for the hot standby feedback
- The primary and replicas all connect to the same pageservers


# Context

Some useful things to know about hot standby and replicas in
PostgreSQL.

## PostgreSQL startup sequence

"Running" and "start up" terms are little imprecise. PostgreSQL
replica startup goes through several stages:

1. First, the process is started up, and various initialization steps
   are performed, like initializing shared memory. If you try to
   connect to the server in this stage, you get an error: ERROR: the
   database system is starting up. This stage happens very quickly, no

2. Then the server reads the checpoint record from the WAL and starts
   the WAL replay starting from the checkpoint. This works differently
   in Neon: we start the WAL replay at the basebackup LSN, not from a
   checkpoint! If you connect to the server in this state, you get an
   error: ERROR: the database system is not yet accepting
   connections. We proceed to the next stage, when the WAL replay sees
   a running-xacts record. Or in Neon, the "CLOG scanning" mechanism
   can allow us to move directly to next stage, with all the caveats
   listed in this RFC.

3. When the running-xacts information is established, the server
   starts to accept connections normally.

From PostgreSQL's point of view, the server is already running in
stage 2, even though it's not accepting connections yet. Our
`compute_ctl` does not consider it as running until stage 3. If the
transition from stage 2 to 3 doesn't happen fast enough, the control
plane will mark the start operation as failed.


## Decisions, Issues

### Cache invalidation in replica

When a read replica follows the primary in PostgreSQL, it needs to
stream all the WAL from the primary and apply all the records, to keep
the local copy of the data consistent with the primary. In Neon, the
replica can fetch the updated page versions from the pageserver, so
it's not necessary to apply all the WAL. However, it needs to ensure
that any pages that are currently in the Postgres buffer cache, or the
Local File Cache, are either updated, or thrown away so that the next
read of the page will fetch the latest version.

We choose to apply the WAL records for pages that are already in the
buffer cache, and skip records for other pages. Somewhat arbitrarily,
we also apply records affecting catalog relations, fetching the old
page version from the pageserver if necessary first. See
`neon_redo_read_buffer_filter()` function.

The replica wouldn't necessarily need to see all the WAL records, only
the records that apply to cached pages. For simplicity, we do stream
all the WAL to the replica, and the replica simply ignores WAL records
that require no action.

Like in PostgreSQL, the read replica maintains a "replay LSN", which
is the LSN up to which the replica has received and replayed the
WAL. The replica can lag behind the primary, if it cannot quite keep
up with the primary, or if a long-running query conflicts with changes
that are about to be applied, or even intentionally if the user wishes
to see delayed data (see recovery_min_apply_delay). It's important
that the replica sees a consistent view of the whole cluster at the
replay LSN, when it's lagging behind.

In Neon, the replica connects to a safekeeper to get the WAL
stream. That means that the safekeepers must be able to regurgitate
the original WAL as far back as the replay LSN of any running read
replica. (A static read-only node that does not follow the primary
does not require a WAL stream however). The primary does not need to
be running, and when it is, the replicas don't incur any extra
overhead to the primary (see hot standby feedback though).

### In-progress transactions

In PostgreSQL, when a hot standby server starts up, it cannot
immediately open up for queries (see [PostgreSQL startup
sequence]). It first needs to establish a complete list of in-progress
transactions, including subtransactions, that are running at the
primary, at the current replay LSN. Normally that happens quickly,
when the replica sees a "running-xacts" WAL record, because the
primary writes a running-xacts WAL record at every checkpoint, and in
PostgreSQL the replica always starts the WAL replay from a checkpoint
REDO point. (A shutdown checkpoint WAL record also implies that all
the non-prepared transactions have ended.) If there are a lot of
subtransactions in progress, however, the standby might need to wait
for old transactions to complete before it can open up for queries.

In Neon that problem is worse: a replica can start at any LSN, so
there's no guarantee that it will see a running-xacts record any time
soon. In particular, if the primary is not running when the replica is
started, it might never see a running-xacts record.

To make things worse, we initially missed this issue, and always
started accepting queries at replica startup, even if it didn't have
the transaction information. That could lead to incorrect query
results and data corruption later. However, as we fixed that, we
introduced a new problem compared to what we had before: previously
the replica would always start up, but after fixing that bug, it might
not. In a superficial way, the old behavior was better (but could lead
to serious issues later!). That made fixing that bug was very hard,
because as we fixed it, we made things (superficially) worse for
others.

See https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/7288 which fixed the
bug, and follow-up PRs https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/8323
and https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/8484 to try to claw back
the cases that started to cause trouble as fixing it. As of this
writing, there are still cases where a replica might not immediately
start up, causing the control plane operation to fail, the remaining
issues are tracked in https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/6211.

One long-term fix for this is to switch to using so-called CSN
snapshots in read replica. That would make it unnecessary to have the
full in-progress transaction list in the replica at startup time. See
https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/4912/ for a work-in-progress
patch to upstream to implement that.

Another thing we could do is to teach the control plane about that
distinction between "starting up" and "running but haven't received
running-xacts information yet", so that we could keep the replica
waiting longer in that stage, and also give any client connections the
same `ERROR: the database system is not yet accepting connections`
error that you get in standalone PostgreSQL in that state.


### Recovery conflicts and Hot standby feedback

It's possible that a tuple version is vacuumed away in the primary,
even though it is still needed by a running transactions in the
replica. This is called a "recovery conflict", and PostgreSQL provides
various options for dealing with it. By default, the WAL replay will
wait up to 30 s for the conflicting query to finish. After that, it
will kill the running query, so that the WAL replay can proceed.

Another way to avoid the situation is to enable the
[`hot_standby_feedback`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-HOT-STANDBY-FEEDBACK)
option. When it is enabled, the primary will refrain from vacuuming
tuples that are still needed in the primary. That means potentially
bloating the primary, which violates the usual rule that read replicas
don't affect the operations on the primary, which is why it's off by
default. We leave it to users to decide if they want to turn it on,
same as PostgreSQL.

Neon supports `hot_standby_feedback` by passing the feedback messages
from the replica to the safekeepers, and from safekeepers to the
primary.

### Relationship of settings between primary and replica

In order to enter hot standby mode, some configuration options need to
be set to the same or larger values in the standby, compared to the
primary.  See [explanation in the PostgreSQL
docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html#HOT-STANDBY-ADMIN)

In Neon, we have this problem too. To prevent customers from hitting
it, the control plane automatically adjusts the settings of a replica,
so that they match or exceed the primary's settings (see
https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/issues/14903). However, you
can still hit the issue if the primary is restarted with larger
settings, while the replica is running.


### Interaction with Pageserver GC

The read replica can lag behind the primary. If there are recovery
conflicts or the replica cannot keep up for some reason, the lag can
in principle grow indefinitely. The replica will issue all GetPage
requests to the pageservers at the current replay LSN, and needs to
see the old page versions.

If the retention period in the pageserver is set to be small, it may
have already garbage collected away the old page versions. That will
cause read errors in the compute, and can mean that the replica cannot
make progress with the replication anymore.

There is a mechanism for replica to pass information about its replay
LSN to the pageserver, so that the pageserver refrains from GC'ing
data that is still needed by the standby. It's called
'standby_horizon' in the pageserver code, see
https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/7368. A separate "lease"
mechanism also is in the works, where the replica could hold a lease
on the old LSN, preventing the pageserver from advancing the GC
horizon past that point. The difference is that the standby_horizon
mechanism relies on a feedback message from replica to safekeeper,
while the least API is exposed directly from the pageserver. A static
read-only node is not connected to safekeepers, so it cannot use the
standby_horizon mechanism.


### Synchronous replication

We haven't put any effort into synchronous replication yet.

PostgreSQL provides multiple levels of synchronicity. In the weaker
levels, a transaction is not acknowledged as committed to the client
in the primary until the WAL has been streamed to a replica or flushed
to disk there. Those modes don't make senses in Neon, because the
safekeepers handle durability.

`synchronous_commit=remote_apply` mode would make sense. In that mode,
the commit is not acknowledged to the client until it has been
replayed in the replica. That ensures that after commit, you can see
the commit in the replica too (aka. read-your-write consistency).


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/037-storage-controller-restarts.md:

# Rolling Storage Controller Restarts

## Summary

This RFC describes the issues around the current storage controller restart procedure
and describes an implementation which reduces downtime to a few milliseconds on the happy path.

## Motivation

Storage controller upgrades (restarts, more generally) can cause multi-second availability gaps.
While the storage controller does not sit on the main data path, it's generally not acceptable
to block management requests for extended periods of time (e.g. https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/8034).

### Current Implementation

The storage controller runs in a Kubernetes Deployment configured for one replica and strategy set to [Recreate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#recreate-deployment).
In non Kubernetes terms, during an upgrade, the currently running storage controller is stopped and, only after,
a new instance is created.

At start-up, the storage controller calls into all the pageservers it manages (retrieved from DB) to learn the
latest locations of all tenant shards present on them. This is usually fast, but can push into tens of seconds
under unfavourable circumstances: pageservers are heavily loaded or unavailable.

## Prior Art

There's probably as many ways of handling restarts gracefully as there are distributed systems. Some examples include:
* Active/Standby architectures: Two or more instance of the same service run, but traffic is only routed to one of them.
For fail-over, traffic is routed to one of the standbys (which becomes active).
* Consensus Algorithms (Raft, Paxos and friends): The part of consensus we care about here is leader election: peers communicate to each other
and use a voting scheme that ensures the existence of a single leader (e.g. Raft epochs).

## Requirements

* Reduce storage controller unavailability during upgrades to milliseconds
* Minimize the interval in which it's possible for more than one storage controller
to issue reconciles.
* Have one uniform implementation for restarts and upgrades
* Fit in with the current Kubernetes deployment scheme

## Non Goals

* Implement our own consensus algorithm from scratch
* Completely eliminate downtime storage controller downtime. Instead we aim to reduce it to the point where it looks
like a transient error to the control plane

## Impacted Components

* storage controller
* deployment orchestration (i.e. Ansible)
* helm charts

## Terminology

* Observed State: in-memory mapping between tenant shards and their current pageserver locations - currently built up
at start-up by quering pageservers
* Deployment: Kubernetes [primitive](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) that models
a set of replicas

## Implementation

### High Level Flow

At a very high level the proposed idea is to start a new storage controller instance while
the previous one is still running and cut-over to it when it becomes ready. The new instance,
should coordinate with the existing one and transition responsibility gracefully. While the controller
has built in safety against split-brain situations (via generation numbers), we'd like to avoid such
scenarios since they can lead to availability issues for tenants that underwent changes while two controllers
were operating at the same time and require operator intervention to remedy.

### Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

On the Kubernetes configuration side, the proposal is to update the storage controller `Deployment`
to use `spec.strategy.type = RollingUpdate`, `spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge=1` and `spec.strategy.maxUnavailable=0`.
Under the hood, Kubernetes creates a new replica set and adds one pod to it (`maxSurge=1`). The old replica set does not
scale down until the new replica set has one replica in the ready state (`maxUnavailable=0`).

The various possible failure scenarios are investigated in the [Handling Failures](#handling-failures) section.

### Storage Controller Start-Up

This section describes the primitives required on the storage controller side and the flow of the happy path.

#### Database Table For Leader Synchronization

A new table should be added to the storage controller database for leader synchronization during startup.
This table will always contain at most one row. The proposed name for the table is `leader` and the schema
contains two elements:
* `hostname`: represents the hostname for the current storage controller leader - should be addressible
from other pods in the deployment
* `start_timestamp`: holds the start timestamp for the current storage controller leader (UTC timezone) - only required
for failure case handling: see [Previous Leader Crashes Before New Leader Readiness](#previous-leader-crashes-before-new-leader-readiness)

Storage controllers will read the leader row at start-up and then update it to mark themselves as the leader
at the end of the start-up sequence. We want compare-and-exchange semantics for the update: avoid the
situation where two concurrent updates succeed and overwrite each other. The default Postgres isolation
level is `READ COMMITTED`, which isn't strict enough here. This update transaction should use at least `REPEATABLE
READ` isolation level in order to [prevent lost updates](https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05/08.html). Currently,
the storage controller uses the stricter `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level for all transactions. This more than suits
our needs here.

```
START TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ
UPDATE leader SET hostname=<new_hostname>, start_timestamp=<new_start_ts>
WHERE hostname=<old_hostname>, start_timestampt=<old_start_ts>;
```

If the transaction fails or if no rows have been updated, then the compare-and-exchange is regarded as a failure.

#### Step Down API

A new HTTP endpoint should be added to the storage controller: `POST /control/v1/step_down`. Upon receiving this
request the leader cancels any pending reconciles and goes into a mode where it replies with 503 to all other APIs
and does not issue any location configurations to its pageservers. The successful HTTP response will return a serialized
snapshot of the observed state.

If other step down requests come in after the initial one, the request is handled and the observed state is returned (required
for failure scenario handling - see [Handling Failures](#handling-failures)).

#### Graceful Restart Happy Path

At start-up, the first thing the storage controller does is retrieve the sole row from the new
`leader` table. If such an entry exists, send a `/step_down` PUT API call to the current leader.
This should be retried a few times with a short backoff (see [1]). The aspiring leader loads the
observed state into memory and the start-up sequence proceeds as usual, but *without* querying the
pageservers in order to build up the observed state.

Before doing any reconciliations or persistence change, update the `leader` database table as described in the [Database Table For Leader Synchronization](database-table-for-leader-synchronization)
section. If this step fails, the storage controller process exits.

Note that no row will exist in the `leaders` table for the first graceful restart. In that case, force update the `leader` table
(without the WHERE clause) and perform with the pre-existing start-up procedure (i.e. build observed state by querying pageservers).

Summary of proposed new start-up sequence:
1. Call `/step_down`
2. Perform any pending database migrations
3. Load state from database
4. Load observed state returned in step (1) into memory
5. Do initial heartbeat round (may be moved after 5)
7. Mark self as leader by updating the database
8. Reschedule and reconcile everything

Some things to note from the steps above:
* The storage controller makes no changes to the cluster state before step (5) (i.e. no location config
calls to the pageserver and no compute notifications)
* Ask the current leader to step down before loading state from database so we don't get a lost update
if the transactions overlap.
* Before loading the observed state at step (3), cross-validate against the database. If validation fails,
fall back to asking the pageservers about their current locations.
* Database migrations should only run **after** the previous instance steps down (or the step down times out).


[1] The API call might fail because there's no storage controller running (i.e. [restart](#storage-controller-crash-or-restart)),
so we don't want to extend the unavailability period by much. We still want to retry since that's not the common case.

### Handling Failures

#### Storage Controller Crash Or Restart

The storage controller may crash or be restarted outside of roll-outs. When a new pod is created, its call to
`/step_down` will fail since the previous leader is no longer reachable. In this case perform the pre-existing
start-up procedure and update the leader table (with the WHERE clause). If the update fails, the storage controller
exists and consistency is maintained.

#### Previous Leader Crashes Before New Leader Readiness

When the previous leader (P1) crashes before the new leader (P2) passses the readiness check, Kubernetes will
reconcile the old replica set and create a new pod for it (P1'). The `/step_down` API call will fail for P1'
(see [2]).

Now we have two cases to consider:
* P2 updates the `leader` table first: The database update from P1' will fail and P1' will exit, or be terminated
by Kubernetes depending on timings.
* P1' updates the `leader` table first: The `hostname` field of the `leader` row stays the same, but the `start_timestamp` field changes.
The database update from P2 will fail (since `start_timestamp` does not match). P2 will exit and Kubernetes will
create a new replacement pod for it (P2'). Now the entire dance starts again, but with P1' as the leader and P2' as the incumbent.

[2] P1 and P1' may (more likely than not) be the same pod and have the same hostname. The implementation
should avoid this self reference and fail the API call at the client if the persisted hostname matches
the current one.

#### Previous Leader Crashes After New Leader Readiness

The deployment's replica sets already satisfy the deployment's replica count requirements and the
Kubernetes deployment rollout will just clean up the dead pod.

#### New Leader Crashes Before Pasing Readiness Check

The deployment controller scales up the new replica sets by creating a new pod. The entire procedure is repeated
with the new pod.

#### Network Partition Between New Pod and Previous Leader

This feels very unlikely, but should be considered in any case. P2 (the new aspiring leader) fails the `/step_down`
API call into P1 (the current leader). P2 proceeds with the pre-existing startup procedure and updates the `leader` table.
Kubernetes will terminate P1, but there may be a brief period where both storage controller can drive reconciles.

### Dealing With Split Brain Scenarios

As we've seen in the previous section, we can end up with two storage controller running at the same time. The split brain
duration is not bounded since the Kubernetes controller might become partitioned from the pods (unlikely though). While these
scenarios are not fatal, they can cause tenant unavailability, so we'd like to reduce the chances of this happening.
The rest of this section sketches some safety measure. It's likely overkill to implement all of them however.

### Ensure Leadership Before Producing Side Effects

The storage controller has two types of side effects: location config requests into pageservers and compute notifications into the control plane.
Before issuing either, the storage controller could check that it is indeed still the leader by querying the database. Side effects might still be
applied if they race with the database updatem, but the situation will eventually be detected. The storage controller process should terminate in these cases.

### Leadership Lease

Up until now, the leadership defined by this RFC is static. In order to bound the length of the split brain scenario, we could require the leadership
to be renewed periodically. Two new columns would be added to the leaders table:
1. `last_renewed` - timestamp indicating when the lease was last renewed
2. `lease_duration` - duration indicating the amount of time after which the lease expires

The leader periodically attempts to renew the lease by checking that it is in fact still the legitimate leader and updating `last_renewed` in the
same transaction. If the update fails, the process exits. New storage controller instances wishing to become leaders must wait for the current lease
to expire before acquiring leadership if they have not succesfully received a response to the `/step_down` request.

### Notify Pageserver Of Storage Controller Term

Each time that leadership changes, we can bump a `term` integer column in the `leader` table. This term uniquely identifies a leader.
Location config requests and re-attach responses can include this term. On the pageserver side, keep the latest term in memory and refuse
anything which contains a stale term (i.e. smaller than the current one).

### Observability

* The storage controller should expose a metric which describes it's state (`Active | WarmingUp | SteppedDown`).
Per region alerts should be added on this metric which triggers when:
  + no storage controller has been in the `Active` state for an extended period of time
  + more than one storage controllers are in the `Active` state

* An alert that periodically verifies that the `leader` table is in sync with the metric above would be very useful.
We'd have to expose the storage controller read only database to Grafana (perhaps it is already done).

## Alternatives

### Kubernetes Leases

Kubernetes has a [lease primitive](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/) which can be used to implement leader election.
Only one instance may hold a lease at any given time. This lease needs to be periodically renewed and has an expiration period.

In our case, it would work something like this:
* `/step_down` deletes the lease or stops it from renewing
* lease acquisition becomes part of the start-up procedure

The kubert crate implements a [lightweight lease API](https://docs.rs/kubert/latest/kubert/lease/struct.LeaseManager.html), but it's still
not exactly trivial to implement.

This approach has the benefit of baked in observability (`kubectl describe lease`), but:
* We offload the responsibility to Kubernetes which makes it harder to debug when things go wrong.
* More code surface than the simple "row in database" approach. Also, most of this code would be in
a dependency not subject to code review, etc.
* Hard to test. Our testing infra does not run the storage controller in Kubernetes and changing it do
so is not simple and complictes and the test set-up.

To my mind, the "row in database" approach is straightforward enough that we don't have to offload this
to something external.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/038-aux-file-v2.md:

# AUX file v2

## Summary

This is a retrospective RFC describing a new storage strategy for AUX files.

## Motivation

The original aux file storage strategy stores everything in a single `AUX_FILES_KEY`.
Every time the compute node streams a `neon-file` record to the pageserver, it will
update the aux file hash map, and then write the serialized hash map into the key.
This creates serious space bloat. There was a fix to log delta records (i.e., update
a key in the hash map) to the aux file key. In this way, the pageserver only stores
the deltas at each of the LSNs. However, this improved v1 storage strategy still
requires us to store everything in an aux file cache in memory, because we cannot
fetch a single key (or file) from the compound `AUX_FILES_KEY`.

### Prior art

For storing large amount of small files, we can use a key-value store where the key
is the filename and the value is the file content.

## Requirements

- No space bloat, fixed space amplification.
- No write bloat, fixed write amplification.

## Impacted Components

pageserver

## Sparse Keyspace

In pageserver, we had assumed the keyspaces are always contiguous. For example, if the keyspace 0x0000-0xFFFF
exists in the pageserver, every single key in the key range would exist in the storage. Based on the prior
assumption, there are code that traverses the keyspace by iterating every single key.

```rust
loop {
    // do something
    key = key.next();
}
```

If a keyspace is very large, for example, containing `2^64` keys, this loop will take infinite time to run.
Therefore, we introduce the concept of sparse keyspace in this RFC. For a sparse keyspace, not every key would
exist in the key range. Developers should not attempt to iterate every single key in the keyspace. Instead,
they should fetch all the layer files in the key range, and then do a merge of them.

In aux file v2, we store aux files within the sparse keyspace of the prefix `AUX_KEY_PREFIX`.

## AUX v2 Keyspace and Key Mapping

Pageserver uses fixed-size keys. The key is 128b. In order to store files of arbitrary filenames into the
keyspace, we assign a predetermined prefix based on the directory storing the aux file, and use the FNV hash
of the filename for the rest bits of the key. The encoding scheme is defined in `encode_aux_file_key`.

For example, `pg_logical/mappings/test1` will be encoded as:

```
62 0000 01 01 7F8B83D94F7081693471ABF91C
^ aux prefix
        ^ assigned prefix of pg_logical/
           ^ assigned prefix of mappings/
              ^ 13B FNV hash of test1
   ^ not used due to key representation
```

The prefixes of the directories should be assigned every time we add a new type of aux file into the storage within `aux_file.rs`. For all directories without an assigned prefix, it will be put into the `0xFFFF` keyspace.

Note that inside pageserver, there are two representations of the keys: the 18B full key representation
and the 16B compact key representation. For the 18B representation, some fields have restricted ranges
of values. Therefore, the aux keys only use the 16B compact portion of the full key.

It is possible that two files get mapped to the same key due to hash collision. Therefore, the value of
each of the aux key is an array that contains all filenames and file content that should be stored in
this key.

We use `Value::Image` to store the aux keys. Therefore, page reconstruction works in the same way as before,
and we do not need addition code to support reconstructing the value. We simply get the latest image from
the storage.

## Inbound Logical Replication Key Mapping

For inbound logical replication, Postgres needs the `replorigin_checkpoint` file to store the data.
This file not directly stored in the pageserver using the aux v2 mechanism. It is constructed during
generating the basebackup by scanning the `REPL_ORIGIN_KEY_PREFIX` keyspace.

## Sparse Keyspace Read Path

There are two places we need to read the aux files from the pageserver:

* On the write path, when the compute node adds an aux file to the pageserver, we will retrieve the key from the storage, append the file to the hashed key, and write it back. The current `get` API already supports that.
*  We use the vectored get API to retrieve all aux files during generating the basebackup. Because we need to scan a sparse keyspace, we slightly modified the vectored get path. The vectorized API used to always attempt to retrieve every single key within the requested key range, and therefore, we modified it in a way that keys within `NON_INHERITED_SPARSE_RANGE` will not trigger missing key error. Furthermore, as aux file reads usually need all layer files intersecting with that key range within the branch and cover a big keyspace, it incurs large overhead for tracking keyspaces that have not been read. Therefore, for sparse keyspaces, we [do not track](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/9631) `ummapped_keyspace`.

## Compaction and Image Layer Generation

With the add of sparse keyspaces, we also modified the compaction code to accommodate the fact that sparse keyspaces do not have every single key stored in the storage.

* L0 compaction: we modified the hole computation code so that it can handle sparse keyspaces when computing holes.
* Image layer creation: instead of calling `key.next()` and getting/reconstructing images for every single key, we use the vectored get API to scan all keys in the keyspace at a given LSN. Image layers are only created if there are too many delta layers between the latest LSN and the last image layer we generated for sparse keyspaces. The created image layer always cover the full aux key range for now, and could be optimized later.

## Migration

We decided not to make the new aux storage strategy (v1) compatible with the original one (v1). One feasible way of doing a seamless migration is to store new data in aux v2 while old data in aux v1, but this complicates file deletions. We want all users to start with a clean state with no aux files in the storage, and therefore, we need to do manual migrations for users using aux v1 by using the [migration script](https://github.com/neondatabase/aux_v2_migration).

During the period of migration, we store the aux policy in the `index_part.json` file. When a tenant is attached
with no policy set, the pageserver will scan the aux file keyspaces to identify the current aux policy being used (v1 or v2).

If a timeline has aux v1 files stored, it will use aux file policy v1 unless we do a manual migration for them. Otherwise, the default aux file policy for new timelines is aux v2. Users enrolled in logical replication before we set aux v2 as default use aux v1 policy. Users who tried setting up inbound replication (which was not supported at that time) may also create some file entries in aux v1 store, even if they did not enroll in the logical replication testing program.

The code for aux v2 migration is in https://github.com/neondatabase/aux_v2_migration. The toolkit scans all projects with logical replication enabled. For all these projects, it put the computes into maintenance mode (suspend all of then), call the migration API to switch the aux file policy on the pageserver (which drops all replication states), and restart all the computes.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/038-independent-compute-release.md:

# Independent compute release

Created at: 2024-08-30. Author: Alexey Kondratov (@ololobus)

## Summary

This document proposes an approach to fully independent compute release flow. It attempts to
cover the following features:

- Process is automated as much as possible to minimize human errors.
- Compute<->storage protocol compatibility is ensured.
- A transparent release history is available with an easy rollback strategy.
- Although not in the scope of this document, there is a viable way to extend the proposed release
  flow to achieve the canary and/or blue-green deployment strategies.

## Motivation

Previously, the compute release was tightly coupled to the storage release. This meant that once
some storage nodes got restarted with a newer version, all new compute starts using these nodes
automatically got a new version. Thus, two releases happen in parallel, which increases the blast
radius and makes ownership fuzzy.

Now, we practice a manual v0 independent compute release flow -- after getting a new compute release
image and tag, we pin it region by region using Admin UI. It's better, but it still has its own flaws:

1. It's a simple but fairly manual process, as you need to click through a few pages.
2. It's prone to human errors, e.g., you could mistype or copy the wrong compute tag.
3. We now require an additional approval in the Admin UI, which partially solves the 2.,
   but also makes the whole process pretty annoying, as you constantly need to go back
   and forth between two people.

## Non-goals

It's not the goal of this document to propose a design for some general-purpose release tool like Helm.
The document considers how the current compute fleet is orchestrated at Neon. Even if we later
decide to split the control plane further (e.g., introduce a separate compute controller), the proposed
release process shouldn't change much, i.e., the releases table and API will reside in
one of the parts.

Achieving the canary and/or blue-green deploy strategies is out of the scope of this document. They
were kept in mind, though, so it's expected that the proposed approach will lay down the foundation
for implementing them in future iterations.

## Impacted components

Compute, control plane, CI, observability (some Grafana dashboards may require changes).

## Prior art

One of the very close examples is how Helm tracks [releases history](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_history/).

In the code:

- [Release](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/2b30cf4b61d587d3f7594102bb202b787b9918db/pkg/release/release.go#L20-L43)
- [Release info](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/2b30cf4b61d587d3f7594102bb202b787b9918db/pkg/release/info.go#L24-L40)
- [Release status](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/2b30cf4b61d587d3f7594102bb202b787b9918db/pkg/release/status.go#L18-L42)

TL;DR it has several important attributes:

- Revision -- unique release ID/primary key. It is not the same as the application version,
  because the same version can be deployed several times, e.g., after a newer version rollback.
- App version -- version of the application chart/code.
- Config -- set of overrides to the default config of the application.
- Status -- current status of the release in the history.
- Timestamps -- tracks when a release was created and deployed.

## Proposed implementation

### Separate release branch

We will use a separate release branch, `release-compute`, to have a clean history for releases and commits.
In order to avoid confusion with storage releases, we will use a different prefix for compute [git release
tags](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/releases) -- `release-compute-XXXX`. We will use the same tag for
Docker images as well. The `neondatabase/compute-node-v16:release-compute-XXXX` looks longer and a bit redundant,
but it's better to have image and git tags in sync.

Currently, control plane relies on the numeric compute and storage release versions to decide on compute->storage
compatibility. Once we implement this proposal, we should drop this code as release numbers will be completely
independent. The only constraint we want is that it must monotonically increase within the same release branch.

### Compute config/settings manifest

We will create a new sub-directory `compute` and file `compute/manifest.yaml` with a structure:

```yaml
pg_settings:
  # Common settings for primaries and secondaries of all versions.
  common:
    wal_log_hints: "off"
    max_wal_size: "1024"

  per_version:
    14:
      # Common settings for both replica and primary of version PG 14
      common:
        shared_preload_libraries: "neon,pg_stat_statements,extension_x"
    15:
      common:
        shared_preload_libraries: "neon,pg_stat_statements,extension_x"
      # Settings that should be applied only to
      replica:
        # Available only starting Postgres 15th
        recovery_prefetch: "off"
    # ...
    17:
      common:
        # For example, if third-party `extension_x` is not yet available for PG 17
        shared_preload_libraries: "neon,pg_stat_statements"
      replica:
        recovery_prefetch: "off"
```

**N.B.** Setting value should be a string with `on|off` for booleans and a number (as a string)
without units for all numeric settings. That's how the control plane currently operates.

The priority of settings will be (a higher number is a higher priority):

1. Any static and hard-coded settings in the control plane
2. `pg_settings->common`
3. Per-version `common`
4. Per-version `replica`
5. Any per-user/project/endpoint overrides in the control plane
6. Any dynamic setting calculated based on the compute size

**N.B.** For simplicity, we do not do any custom logic for `shared_preload_libraries`, so it's completely
overridden if specified on some level. Make sure that you include all necessary extensions in it when you
do any overrides.

**N.B.** There is a tricky question about what to do with custom compute image pinning we sometimes
do for particular projects and customers. That's usually some ad-hoc work and images are based on
the latest compute image, so it's relatively safe to assume that we could use settings from the latest compute
release. If for some reason that's not true, and further overrides are needed, it's also possible to do
on the project level together with pinning the image, so it's on-call/engineer/support responsibility to
ensure that compute starts with the specified custom image. The only real risk is that compute image will get
stale and settings from new releases will drift away, so eventually it will get something incompatible,
but i) this is some operational issue, as we do not want stale images anyway, and ii) base settings
receive something really new so rarely that the chance of this happening is very low. If we want to solve it completely,
then together with pinning the image we could also pin the matching release revision in the control plane.

The compute team will own the content of `compute/manifest.yaml`.

### Control plane: releases table

In order to store information about releases, the control plane will use a table `compute_releases` with the following
schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE compute_releases (
  -- Unique release ID
  -- N.B. Revision won't by synchronized across all regions, because all control planes are technically independent
  -- services. We have the same situation with Helm releases as well because they could be deployed and rolled back
  -- independently in different clusters.
  revision BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  -- Numeric version of the compute image, e.g. 9057
  version BIGINT NOT NULL,
  -- Compute image tag, e.g. `release-9057`
  tag TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- Current release status. Currently, it will be a simple enum
  -- * `deployed` -- release is deployed and used for new compute starts.
  --                 Exactly one release can have this status at a time.
  -- * `superseded` -- release has been replaced by a newer one.
  -- But we can always extend it in the future when we need more statuses
  -- for more complex deployment strategies.
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- Any additional metadata for compute in the corresponding release
  manifest JSONB NOT NULL,
  -- Timestamp when release record was created in the control plane database
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  -- Timestamp when release deployment was finished
  deployed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

We keep track of the old releases not only for the sake of audit, but also because we usually have ~30% of
old computes started using the image from one of the previous releases. Yet, when users want to reconfigure
them without restarting, the control plane needs to know what settings are applicable to them, so we also need
information about the previous releases that are readily available. There could be some other auxiliary info
needed as well: supported extensions, compute flags, etc.

**N.B.** Here, we can end up in an ambiguous situation when the same compute image is deployed twice, e.g.,
it was deployed once, then rolled back, and then deployed again, potentially with a different manifest. Yet,
we could've started some computes with the first deployment and some with the second. Thus, when we need to
look up the manifest for the compute by its image tag, we will see two records in the table with the same tag,
but different revision numbers. We can assume that this could happen only in case of rollbacks, so we
can just take the latest revision for the given tag.

### Control plane: management API

The control plane will implement new API methods to manage releases:

1. `POST /management/api/v2/compute_releases` to create a new release. With payload

   ```json
    {
      "version": 9057,
      "tag": "release-9057",
      "manifest": {}
    }
   ```

   and response

   ```json
    {
      "revision": 53,
      "version": 9057,
      "tag": "release-9057",
      "status": "deployed",
      "manifest": {},
      "created_at": "2024-08-15T15:52:01.0000Z",
      "deployed_at": "2024-08-15T15:52:01.0000Z",
    }
   ```

   Here, we can actually mix-in custom (remote) extensions metadata into the `manifest`, so that the control plane
   will get information about all available extensions not bundled into compute image. The corresponding
   workflow in `neondatabase/build-custom-extensions` should produce it as an artifact and make
   it accessible to the workflow in the `neondatabase/infra`. See the complete release flow below. Doing that,
   we put a constraint that new custom extension requires new compute release, which is good for the safety,
   but is not exactly what we want operational-wise (we want to be able to deploy new extensions without new
   images). Yet, it can be solved incrementally: v0 -- do not do anything with extensions at all;
   v1 -- put them into the same manifest; v2 -- make them separate entities with their own lifecycle.

   **N.B.** This method is intended to be used in CI workflows, and CI/network can be flaky. It's reasonable
   to assume that we could retry the request several times, even though it's already succeeded. Although it's
   not a big deal to create several identical releases one-by-one, it's better to avoid it, so the control plane
   should check if the latest release is identical and just return `304 Not Modified` in this case.

2. `POST /management/api/v2/compute_releases/rollback` to rollback to any previously deployed release. With payload
   including the revision of the release to rollback to:

   ```json
   {
      "revision": 52
   }
   ```

   Rollback marks the current release as `superseded` and creates a new release with all the same data as the
   requested revision, but with a new revision number.

   This rollback API is not strictly needed, as we can just use `infra` repo workflow to deploy any
   available tag. It's still nice to have for on-call and any urgent matters, for example, if we need
   to rollback and GitHub is down. It's much easier to specify only the revision number vs. crafting
   all the necessary data for the new release payload.

### Compute->storage compatibility tests

In order to safely release new compute versions independently from storage, we need to ensure that the currently
deployed storage is compatible with the new compute version. Currently, we maintain backward compatibility
in storage, but newer computes may require a newer storage version.

Remote end-to-end (e2e) tests [already accept](https://github.com/neondatabase/cloud/blob/e3468d433e0d73d02b7d7e738d027f509b522408/.github/workflows/testing.yml#L43-L48)
`storage_image_tag` and `compute_image_tag` as separate inputs. That means that we could reuse e2e tests to ensure
compatibility between storage and compute:

1. Pick the latest storage release tag and use it as `storage_image_tag`.
2. Pick a new compute tag built in the current compute release PR and use it as `compute_image_tag`.
   Here, we should use a temporary ECR image tag, because the final tag will be known only after the release PR is merged.
3. Trigger e2e tests as usual.

```

## Further work

As briefly mentioned in other sections, eventually, we would like to use more complex deployment strategies.
For example, we can pass a fraction of the total compute starts that should use the new release. Then we can
mark the release as `partial` or `canary` and monitor its performance. If everything is fine, we can promote it
to `deployed` status. If not, we can roll back to the previous one.

## Alternatives

In theory, we can try using Helm as-is:

1. Write a compute Helm chart. That will actually have only some config map, which the control plane can access and read.
   N.B. We could reuse the control plane chart as well, but then it's not a fully independent release again and even more fuzzy.
2. The control plane will read it and start using the new compute version for new starts.

Drawbacks:

1. Helm releases work best if the workload is controlled by the Helm chart itself. Then you can have different
   deployment strategies like rolling update or canary or blue/green deployments. At Neon, the compute starts are controlled
   by control plane, so it makes it much more tricky.
2. Releases visibility will suffer, i.e. instead of a nice table in the control plane and Admin UI, we would need to use
   `helm` cli and/or K8s UIs like K8sLens.
3. We do not restart all computes shortly after the new version release. This means that for some features and compatibility
   purpose (see above) control plane may need some auxiliary info from the previous releases.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/README.md:

This directory contains Request for Comments documents, or RFCs, for
features or concepts that have been proposed. Alternative names:
technical design doc, ERD, one-pager

To make a new proposal, create a new text file in this directory and
open a Pull Request with it. That gives others a chance and a forum
to comment and discuss the design.

When a feature is implemented and the code changes are committed, also
include the corresponding RFC in this directory.

Some of the RFCs in this directory have been implemented in some form
or another, while others are on the roadmap, while still others are
just obsolete and forgotten about. So read them with a grain of salt,
but hopefully even the ones that don't reflect reality give useful
context information.

## What

We use Tech Design RFC’s to summarize what we are planning to
implement in our system. These RFCs should be created for large or not
obvious technical tasks, e.g. changes of the architecture or bigger
tasks that could take over a week, changes that touch multiple
components or their interaction. RFCs should fit into a couple of
pages, but could be longer on occasion.

## Why

We’re using RFCs to enable early review and collaboration, reduce
uncertainties, risk and save time during the implementation phase that
follows the Tech Design RFC.

Tech Design RFCs also aim to avoid bus factor and are an additional
measure to keep more peers up to date & familiar with our design and
architecture.

This is a crucial part for ensuring collaboration across timezones and
setting up for success a distributed team that works on complex
topics.

## How

RFC lifecycle:

- Should be submitted in a pull request with and full RFC text in a committed markdown file and copy of the Summary and Motivation sections also included in the PR body.
- RFC should be published for review before most of the actual code is written. This isn’t a strict rule, don’t hesitate to experiment and build a POC in parallel with writing an RFC.
- Add labels to the PR in the same manner as you do Issues. Example TBD
- Request the review from your peers. Reviewing the RFCs from your peers is a priority, same as reviewing the actual code.
- The Tech Design RFC should evolve based on the feedback received and further during the development phase if problems are discovered with the taken approach
- RFCs stop evolving once the consensus is found or the proposal is implemented and merged.
- RFCs are not intended as a documentation that’s kept up to date **after** the implementation is finished. Do not update the Tech Design RFC when merged functionality evolves later on. In such situation a new RFC may be appropriate.

# Content from file ../neon/docs/rfcs/cluster-size-limits.md:

Cluster size limits
==================

## Summary

One of the resource consumption limits for free-tier users is a cluster size limit.

To enforce it, we need to calculate the timeline size and check if the limit is reached before relation create/extend operations.
If the limit is reached, the query must fail with some meaningful error/warning.
We may want to exempt some operations from the quota to allow users free space to fit back into the limit.

The stateless compute node that performs validation is separate from the storage that calculates the usage, so we need to exchange cluster size information between those components.

## Motivation

Limit the maximum size of a PostgreSQL instance to limit free tier users (and other tiers in the future).
First of all, this is needed to control our free tier production costs.
Another reason to limit resources is risk management — we haven't (fully) tested and optimized neon for big clusters,
so we don't want to give users access to the functionality that we don't think is ready.

## Components

* pageserver - calculate the size consumed by a timeline and add it to the feedback message.
* safekeeper - pass feedback message from pageserver to compute.
* compute - receive feedback message, enforce size limit based on GUC `neon.max_cluster_size`.
* console - set and update `neon.max_cluster_size` setting

## Proposed implementation

First of all, it's necessary to define timeline size.

The current approach is to count all data, including SLRUs. (not including WAL)
Here we think of it as a physical disk underneath the Postgres cluster.
This is how the `LOGICAL_TIMELINE_SIZE` metric is implemented in the pageserver.

Alternatively, we could count only relation data. As in pg_database_size().
This approach is somewhat more user-friendly because it is the data that is really affected by the user.
On the other hand, it puts us in a weaker position than other services, i.e., RDS.
We will need to refactor the timeline_size counter or add another counter to implement it.

Timeline size is updated during wal digestion. It is not versioned and is valid at the last_received_lsn moment.
Then this size should be reported to compute node.

`current_timeline_size` value is included in the walreceiver's custom feedback message: `ReplicationFeedback.`

(PR about protocol changes https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/1037).

This message is received by the safekeeper and propagated to compute node as a part of `AppendResponse`.

Finally, when compute node receives the `current_timeline_size` from safekeeper (or from pageserver directly), it updates the global variable.

And then every neon_extend() operation checks if limit is reached `(current_timeline_size > neon.max_cluster_size)` and throws `ERRCODE_DISK_FULL` error if so.
(see Postgres error codes [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/errcodes-appendix.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/errcodes-appendix.html))

TODO:
We can allow autovacuum processes to bypass this check, simply checking `IsAutoVacuumWorkerProcess()`.
It would be nice to allow manual VACUUM and VACUUM FULL to bypass the check, but it's uneasy to distinguish these operations at the low level.
See issues https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1245
https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/1445

TODO:
We should warn users if the limit is soon to be reached.

### **Reliability, failure modes and corner cases**

1. `current_timeline_size` is valid at the last received and digested by pageserver lsn.

    If pageserver lags behind compute node, `current_timeline_size` will lag too. This lag can be tuned using backpressure, but it is not expected to be 0 all the time.

    So transactions that happen in this lsn range may cause limit overflow. Especially operations that generate (i.e., CREATE DATABASE) or free (i.e., TRUNCATE) a lot of data pages while generating a small amount of WAL. Are there other operations like this?

    Currently, CREATE DATABASE operations are restricted in the console. So this is not an issue.


### **Security implications**

We treat compute as an untrusted component. That's why we try to isolate it with secure container runtime or a VM.
Malicious users may change the `neon.max_cluster_size`, so we need an extra size limit check.
To cover this case, we also monitor the compute node size in the console.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/safekeeper-protocol.md:

# WAL proposer-safekeeper communication consensus protocol.

## General requirements and architecture

There is single stateless master and several safekeepers. Number of safekeepers is determined by redundancy level.
To minimize number of changes in Postgres core, we are using standard streaming replication from master (through WAL sender).
This replication stream is initiated by the WAL proposer process that runs in the PostgreSQL server, which broadcasts the WAL generated by PostgreSQL to safekeepers.
To provide durability we use synchronous replication at master (response to the commit statement is sent to the client
only when acknowledged by WAL receiver). WAL proposer sends this acknowledgment only when LSN of commit record is confirmed by quorum of safekeepers.

WAL proposer tries to establish connections with safekeepers.
At any moment of time each safekeeper can serve exactly once proposer, but it can accept new connections.

Any of safekeepers can be used as WAL server, producing replication stream. So both `Pagers` and `Replicas`
(read-only computation nodes) can connect to safekeeper to receive WAL stream. Safekeepers is streaming WAL until
it reaches min(`commitLSN`,`flushLSN`). Then replication is suspended until new data arrives from master.


## Handshake
The goal of handshake is to collect quorum (to be able to perform recovery)
and avoid split-brains caused by simultaneous presence of old and new master.
Procedure of handshake consists of the following steps:

1. Broadcast information about server to all safekeepers (wal segment size, system_id,...)
2. Receive responses with information about safekeepers.
3. Once quorum of handshake responses are received, propose new `NodeId(max(term)+1, server.uuid)`
to all of them.
4. On receiving proposed nodeId, safekeeper compares it with locally stored nodeId and if it is greater or equals
then accepts proposed nodeId and persists this choice in the local control file.
5. If quorum of safekeepers approve proposed nodeId, then server assumes that handshake is successfully completed and switch to recovery stage.

## Recovery
Proposer computes max(`restartLSN`) and max(`flushLSN`) from quorum of attached safekeepers.
`RestartLSN` - is position in WAL which is known to be delivered to all safekeepers.
In other words: `restartLSN` can be also considered as cut-off horizon (all preceding WAL segments can be removed).
`FlushLSN` is position flushed by safekeeper to the local persistent storage.

If max(`restartLSN`) != max(`flushLSN`), then recovery has to be performed.
Proposer creates replication channel with most advanced safekeeper (safekeeper with the largest `flushLSN`).
Then it downloads all WAL messages between max(`restartLSN`)..max(`flushLSN`).
Messages are inserted in L1-list (ordered by LSN). Then we locate position of each safekeeper in this list according
to their `flushLSN`s. Safekeepers that are not yet connected (out of quorum) should start from the beginning of the list
(corresponding to `restartLSN`).

We need to choose max(`flushLSN`) because voting quorum may be different from quorum committed the last message.
So we do not know whether records with max(`flushLSN`) was committed by quorum or not. So we have to consider it committed
to avoid loose of committed data.

Calculated max(`flushLSN`) is called `VCL` (Volume Complete LSN). As far as it is chosen among quorum, there may be some other offline safekeeper with larger
`VCL`. Once it becomes online, we need to overwrite its WAL beyond `VCL`. To support it, each safekeeper maintains
`epoch` number. `Epoch` plays almost the same role as `term`, but algorithm of `epoch` bumping is different.
`VCL` and new epoch are received by safekeeper from proposer during voting.
But safekeeper doesn't switch to new epoch immediately after voting.
Instead of it, safekeepers waits record with LSN > Max(`flushLSN`,`VCL`) is received.
It means that we restore all records from old generation and switch to new generation.
When proposer calculates max(`FlushLSN`), it first compares `Epoch`. So actually we compare (`Epoch`,`FlushLSN`) pairs.

Let's looks at the examples. Consider that we have three safekeepers: S1, S2, S3. Si(N) means that i-th safekeeper has epoch=N.
Ri(x) - WAL record for resource X with LSN=i. Assume that we have the following state:

```
S1(1): R1(a)
S2(1): R1(a),R2(b)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)  - offline
```

Proposer choose quorum (S1,S2). VCL for them is 2. We download S2 to proposer and schedule its write to S1.
After receiving record R5 the picture can be:

```
S1(2): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e)
S2(2): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)  - offline
```

Now if server is crashed or restarted, we perform new voting and
doesn't matter which quorum we choose: (S1,S2), (S2,S3)...
in any case VCL=3, because S3 has smaller epoch.
R3(c) will be overwritten with R3(e):

```
S1(3): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e)
S2(3): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e),R4(d)
```

Epoch of S3 will be adjusted once it overwrites R4:

```
S1(3): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e),R4(f)
S2(3): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e),R4(f)
S3(3): R1(a),R2(b),R3(e),R4(f)
```

Crash can happen before epoch was bumped. Let's return back to the initial position:

```
S1(1): R1(a)
S2(1): R1(a),R2(b)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)  - offline
```

Assume that we start recovery:

```
S1(1): R1(a),R2(b)
S2(1): R1(a),R2(b)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)  - offline
```

and then crash happens. During voting we choose quorum (S3,S3).
Now them belong to the same epoch and S3 is most advanced among them.
So VCL is set to 4 and we recover S1 and S2 from S3:

```
S1(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)
S2(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)
S3(1): R1(a),R2(b),R3(c),R4(d)
```

## Main loop
Once recovery is completed, proposer switches to normal processing loop: it receives WAL stream from Postgres and appends WAL
messages to the list. At the same time it tries to push messages to safekeepers. Each safekeeper is associated
with some element in message list and once it acknowledged receiving of the message, position is moved forward.
Each queue element contains acknowledgment mask, which bits corresponds to safekeepers.
Once all safekeepers acknowledged receiving of this message (by setting correspondent bit),
then element can be removed from queue and `restartLSN` is advanced forward.

Proposer maintains `restartLSN` and `commitLSN` based on the responses received by safekeepers.
`RestartLSN` equals to the LSN of head message in the list. `CommitLSN` is `flushLSN[nSafekeepers-Quorum]` element
in ordered array with `flushLSN`s of safekeepers. `CommitLSN` and `RestartLSN` are included in requests
sent from proposer to safekeepers and stored in safekeepers control file.
To avoid overhead of extra fsync, this control file is not fsynced on each request. Flushing this file is performed
periodically, which means that `restartLSN`/`commitLSN` stored by safekeeper may be slightly deteriorated.
It is not critical because may only cause redundant processing of some WAL record.
And `FlushLSN` is recalculated after node restart by scanning local WAL files.

## Fault tolerance
If the WAL proposer process looses connection to safekeeper it tries to reestablish this connection using the same nodeId.

Restart of PostgreSQL initiates new round of voting and switching new epoch.

## Limitations
Right now message queue is maintained in main memory and is not spilled to the disk.
It can cause memory overflow in case of presence of lagging safekeepers.
It is assumed that in case of losing local data by some safekeepers, it should be recovered using some external mechanism.


## Glossary
* `CommitLSN`: position in WAL confirmed by quorum safekeepers.
* `RestartLSN`: position in WAL confirmed by all safekeepers.
* `FlushLSN`: part of WAL persisted to the disk by safekeeper.
* `NodeID`: pair (term,UUID)
* `Pager`: Neon component restoring pages from WAL stream
* `Replica`: read-only computation node
* `VCL`: the largest LSN for which we can guarantee availability of all prior records.

## Pageserver

Pageserver is mainly configured via a `pageserver.toml` config file.
If there's no such file during `init` phase of the server, it creates the file itself. Without 'init', the file is read.

There's a possibility to pass an arbitrary config value to the pageserver binary as an argument: such values override
the values in the config file, if any are specified for the same key and get into the final config during init phase.

### Config example

```toml
# Initial configuration file created by 'pageserver --init'
listen_pg_addr = '127.0.0.1:64000'
listen_http_addr = '127.0.0.1:9898'

checkpoint_distance = '268435456' # in bytes
checkpoint_timeout = '10m'

gc_period = '1 hour'
gc_horizon = '67108864'

max_file_descriptors = '100'

# initial superuser role name to use when creating a new tenant
initial_superuser_name = 'cloud_admin'

broker_endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:50051'

# [remote_storage]
```

The config above shows default values for all basic pageserver settings, besides `broker_endpoint`: that one has to be set by the user,
see the corresponding section below.
Pageserver uses default values for all files that are missing in the config, so it's not a hard error to leave the config blank.
Yet, it validates the config values it can (e.g. postgres install dir) and errors if the validation fails, refusing to start.

Note the `[remote_storage]` section: it's a [table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#table) in TOML specification and

- either has to be placed in the config after the table-less values such as `initial_superuser_name = 'cloud_admin'`

- or can be placed anywhere if rewritten in identical form as [inline table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#inline-table): `remote_storage = {foo = 2}`

### Config values

All values can be passed as an argument to the pageserver binary, using the `-c` parameter and specified as a valid TOML string. All tables should be passed in the inline form.

Example: `${PAGESERVER_BIN} -c "checkpoint_timeout = '10 m'" -c "remote_storage={local_path='/some/local/path/'}"`

Note that TOML distinguishes between strings and integers, the former require single or double quotes around them.

#### broker_endpoint

A storage broker endpoint to connect and pull the information from. Default is
`'http://127.0.0.1:50051'`. 

#### checkpoint_distance

`checkpoint_distance` is the amount of incoming WAL that is held in
the open layer, before it's flushed to local disk. It puts an upper
bound on how much WAL needs to be re-processed after a pageserver
crash. It is a soft limit, the pageserver can momentarily go above it,
but it will trigger a checkpoint operation to get it back below the
limit.

`checkpoint_distance` also determines how much WAL needs to be kept
durable in the safekeeper. The safekeeper must have capacity to hold
this much WAL, with some headroom, otherwise you can get stuck in a
situation where the safekeeper is full and stops accepting new WAL,
but the pageserver is not flushing out and releasing the space in the
safekeeper because it hasn't reached checkpoint_distance yet.

`checkpoint_distance` also controls how often the WAL is uploaded to
S3.

The unit is # of bytes.

#### checkpoint_timeout

Apart from `checkpoint_distance`, open layer flushing is also triggered
`checkpoint_timeout` after the last flush. This makes WAL eventually uploaded to
s3 when activity is stopped.

The default is 10m.

#### compaction_period

Every `compaction_period` seconds, the page server checks if
maintenance operations, like compaction, are needed on the layer
files. Default is 1 s, which should be fine.

#### compaction_target_size

File sizes for L0 delta and L1 image layers. Default is 128MB.

#### gc_horizon

`gz_horizon` determines how much history is retained, to allow
branching and read replicas at an older point in time. The unit is #
of bytes of WAL. Page versions older than this are garbage collected
away.

#### gc_period

Interval at which garbage collection is triggered. Default is 1 hour.

#### image_creation_threshold

L0 delta layer threshold for L1 image layer creation. Default is 3.

#### pitr_interval

WAL retention duration for PITR branching. Default is 7 days.

#### walreceiver_connect_timeout

Time to wait to establish the wal receiver connection before failing

#### lagging_wal_timeout

Time the pageserver did not get any WAL updates from safekeeper (if any).
Avoids lagging pageserver preemptively by forcing to switch it from stalled connections.

#### max_lsn_wal_lag

Difference between Lsn values of the latest available WAL on safekeepers: if currently connected safekeeper starts to lag too long and too much,
it gets swapped to the different one.

#### initial_superuser_name

Name of the initial superuser role, passed to initdb when a new tenant
is initialized. It doesn't affect anything after initialization. The
default is Note: The default is 'cloud_admin', and the console
depends on that, so if you change it, bad things will happen.

#### page_cache_size

Size of the page cache. Unit is
number of 8 kB blocks. The default is 8192, which means 64 MB.

#### max_file_descriptors

Max number of file descriptors to hold open concurrently for accessing
layer files. This should be kept well below the process/container/OS
limit (see `ulimit -n`), as the pageserver also needs file descriptors
for other files and for sockets for incoming connections.

#### pg_distrib_dir

A directory with Postgres installation to use during pageserver activities.
Since pageserver supports several postgres versions, `pg_distrib_dir` contains
a subdirectory for each version with naming convention `v{PG_MAJOR_VERSION}/`.
Inside that dir, a `bin/postgres` binary should be present.

The default distrib dir is `./pg_install/`.

#### workdir (-D)

A directory in the file system, where pageserver will store its files.
The default is `./.neon/`.

This parameter has a special CLI alias (`-D`) and can not be overridden with regular `-c` way.

##### Remote storage

There's a way to automatically back up and restore some of the pageserver's data from working dir to the remote storage.
The backup system is disabled by default and can be enabled for either of the currently available storages:

###### Local FS storage

Pageserver can back up and restore some of its workdir contents to another directory.
For that, only a path to that directory needs to be specified as a parameter:

```toml
[remote_storage]
local_path = '/some/local/path/'
```

###### S3 storage

Pageserver can back up and restore some of its workdir contents to S3.
Full set of S3 credentials is needed for that as parameters.
Configuration example:

```toml
[remote_storage]
# Name of the bucket to connect to
bucket_name = 'some-sample-bucket'

# Name of the region where the bucket is located at
bucket_region = 'eu-north-1'

# A "subfolder" in the bucket, to use the same bucket separately by multiple pageservers at once.
# Optional, pageserver uses entire bucket if the prefix is not specified.
prefix_in_bucket = '/some/prefix/'

# S3 API query limit to avoid getting errors/throttling from AWS.
concurrency_limit = 100
```

If no IAM bucket access is used during the remote storage usage, use the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to set the access credentials.

###### General remote storage configuration

Pageserver allows only one remote storage configured concurrently and errors if parameters from multiple different remote configurations are used.
No default values are used for the remote storage configuration parameters.

Besides, there are parameters common for all types of remote storage that can be configured, those have defaults:

```toml
[remote_storage]
# Max number of concurrent timeline synchronized (layers uploaded or downloaded) with the remote storage at the same time.
max_concurrent_syncs = 50

# Max number of errors a single task can have before it's considered failed and not attempted to run anymore.
max_sync_errors = 10
```

### Adding dependencies
When you add a Cargo dependency, you should update hakari manifest by running commands below and committing the updated `Cargo.lock` and `workspace_hack/`. There may be no changes, that's fine.

```bash
cargo hakari generate
cargo hakari manage-deps
```

If you don't have hakari installed (`error: no such subcommand: hakari`), install it by running `cargo install cargo-hakari`.

### Checking Rust 3rd-parties
[Cargo deny](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/index.html) is a cargo plugin that lets us lint project's dependency graph to ensure all dependencies conform to requirements. It detects security issues, matches licenses, and ensures crates only come from trusted sources.

```bash
cargo deny check
```

## Using Python
Note that Debian/Ubuntu Python packages are stale, as it commonly happens,
so manual installation of dependencies is not recommended.

A single virtual environment with all dependencies is described in the single `Pipfile`.

### Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.11 (the minimal supported version) or greater.
    - Our setup with poetry should work with newer python versions too. So feel free to open an issue with a `c/test-runner` label if something doesn't work as expected.
    - If you have some trouble with other version you can resolve it by installing Python 3.11 separately, via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or via system package manager e.g.:
      ```bash
      # In Ubuntu
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install python3.11
      ```
- Install `poetry`
    - Exact version of `poetry` is not important, see installation instructions available at poetry's [website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
- Install dependencies via `./scripts/pysync`.
    - Note that CI uses specific Python version (look for `PYTHON_VERSION` [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/docker-images/blob/main/rust/Dockerfile))
      so if you have different version some linting tools can yield different result locally vs in the CI.
    - You can explicitly specify which Python to use by running `poetry env use /path/to/python`, e.g. `poetry env use python3.11`.
      This may also disable the `The currently activated Python version X.Y.Z is not supported by the project` warning.

Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.
Alternatively, use `poetry run` to run a single command in the venv, e.g. `poetry run pytest`.

### Obligatory checks
We force code formatting via `ruff`, and type hints via `mypy`.
Run the following commands in the repository's root (next to `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
poetry run ruff format . # All code is reformatted
poetry run ruff check .  # Python linter
poetry run mypy .        # Ensure there are no typing errors
```

**WARNING**: do not run `mypy` from a directory other than the root of the repository.
Otherwise it will not find its configuration.

Also consider:

* Running `pycodestyle` (or a linter of your choice) and fixing possible defects, if any.
* Adding more type hints to your code to avoid `Any`.

### Changing dependencies
To add new package or change an existing one you can use `poetry add` or `poetry update` or edit `pyproject.toml` manually. Do not forget to run `poetry lock` in the latter case.

More details are available in poetry's [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

## Configuring IDEs
Neon consists of three projects in different languages which use different project models.

* A bunch of Rust crates, all available from the root `Cargo.toml`.
* Integration tests in Python in the `test_runner` directory. Some stand-alone Python scripts exist as well.
* Postgres and our Postgres extensions in C built with Makefiles under `vendor/postgres` and `pgxn`.

### CLion
You can use CLion with the [Rust plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust) to develop Neon. It should pick up Rust and Python projects whenever you open Neon's repository as a project. We have not tried setting up a debugger, though.

C code requires some extra care, as it's built via Make, not CMake. Some of our developers have successfully used [compilation database](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/compilation-database.html#compdb_generate) for CLion. It is a JSON file which lists all C source files and corresponding compilation keys. CLion can use it instead of `CMakeLists.txt`. To set up a project with a compilation database:

1. Clone the Neon repository and install all dependencies, including Python. Do not open it with CLion just yet.
2. Run the following commands in the repository's root:
   ```bash
   # Install a `compiledb` tool which can parse make's output and generate the compilation database.
   poetry add -D compiledb
   # Clean the build tree so we can rebuild from scratch.
   # Unfortunately, our and Postgres Makefiles do not work well with either --dry-run or --assume-new,
   # so we don't know a way to generate the compilation database without recompiling everything,
   # see https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/issues/2378#issuecomment-1241421325
   make distclean
   # Rebuild the Postgres parts from scratch and save the compilation commands to the compilation database.
   # You can alter the -j parameter to your liking.
   # Note that we only build for a specific version of Postgres. The extension code is shared, but headers are
   # different, so we set up CLion to only use a specific version of the headers.
   make -j$(nproc) --print-directory postgres-v15 neon-pg-ext-v15 | poetry run compiledb --verbose --no-build
   # Uninstall the tool
   poetry remove -D compiledb
   # Make sure the compile_commands.json file is not committed.
   echo /compile_commands.json >>.git/info/exclude
   ```
3. Open CLion, click "Open File or Project" and choose the generated `compile_commands.json` file to be opened "as a project". You cannot add a compilation database into an existing CLion project, you have to create a new one. _Do not_ open the directory as a project, open the file.
4. The newly created project should start indexing Postgres source code in C, as well as the C standard library. You may have to [configure the C compiler for the compilation database](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/compilation-database.html#compdb_toolchain).
5. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in an editor in the same project. CLion should pick up the hint and start indexing Rust code.
6. Now you have a CLion project which knows about C files, Rust files. It should pick up Python files automatically as well.
7. Set up correct code indentation in CLion's settings: Editor > Code Style > C/C++, choose the "Project" scheme on the top, and tick the "Use tab character" on the "Tabs and Indents" tab. Ensure that "Tab size" is 4.

You can also enable Cargo Clippy diagnostics and enable Rustfmt instead of built-in code formatter.

Whenever you change layout of C files, you may need to regenerate the compilation database. No need to re-create the CLion project, changes should be picked up automatically.

Known issues (fixes and suggestions are welcome):

* Test results may be hard to read in CLion, both for unit tests in Rust and integration tests in Python. Use command line to run them instead.
* CLion does not support non-local Python interpreters, unlike PyCharm. E.g. if you use WSL, CLion does not see `poetry` and installed dependencies. Python support is limited.
* Cargo Clippy diagnostics in CLion may take a lot of resources.
* `poetry add -D` updates some packages and changes `poetry.lock` drastically even when followed by `poetry remove -D`. Feel free to `git checkout poetry.lock` and `./scripts/pysync` to revert these changes.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/storage_broker.md:

# Storage broker

Storage broker targets two issues:
- Allowing safekeepers and pageservers learn which nodes also hold their
  timelines, and timeline statuses there.
- Avoiding O(n^2) connections between storage nodes while doing so.

This is used
- By pageservers to determine the most advanced and alive safekeeper to pull WAL from.
- By safekeepers to synchronize on the timeline: advance
  `remote_consistent_lsn`, `backup_lsn`, choose who offloads WAL to s3.

Technically, it is a simple stateless pub-sub message broker based on tonic
(grpc) making multiplexing easy. Since it is stateless, fault tolerance can be
provided by k8s; there is no built in replication support, though it is not hard
to add.

Currently, the only message is `SafekeeperTimelineInfo`. Each safekeeper, for
each active timeline, once in a while pushes timeline status to the broker.
Other nodes subscribe and receive this info, using it per above.

Broker serves /metrics on the same port as grpc service. 

grpcurl can be used to check which values are currently being pushed:
```
grpcurl -proto broker/proto/broker.proto -d '{"all":{}}' -plaintext localhost:50051 storage_broker.BrokerService/SubscribeSafekeeperInfo
```


# Content from file ../neon/docs/storage_controller.md:

# Storage Controller

## Concepts

The storage controller sits between administrative API clients and pageservers, and handles the details of mapping tenants to pageserver tenant shards. For example, creating a tenant is one API call to the storage controller,
which is mapped into many API calls to many pageservers (for multiple shards, and for secondary locations).

It implements a pageserver-compatible API that may be used for CRUD operations on tenants and timelines, translating these requests into appropriate operations on the shards within a tenant, which may be on many different pageservers. Using this API, the storage controller may be used in the same way as the pageserver's administrative HTTP API, hiding
the underlying details of how data is spread across multiple nodes.

The storage controller also manages generations, high availability (via secondary locations) and live migrations for tenants under its management. This is done with a reconciliation loop pattern, where tenants have an “intent” state and a “reconcile” task that tries to make the outside world match the intent.

## APIs

The storage controller’s HTTP server implements four logically separate APIs:

- `/v1/...` path is the pageserver-compatible API. This has to be at the path root because that’s where clients expect to find it on a pageserver.
- `/control/v1/...` path is the storage controller’s API, which enables operations such as registering and management pageservers, or executing shard splits.
- `/debug/v1/...` path contains endpoints which are either exclusively used in tests, or are for use by engineers when supporting a deployed system.
- `/upcall/v1/...` path contains endpoints that are called by pageservers. This includes the `/re-attach` and `/validate` APIs used by pageservers
  to ensure data safety with generation numbers.

The API is authenticated with a JWT token, and tokens must have scope `pageserverapi` (i.e. the same scope as pageservers’ APIs).

See the `http.rs` file in the source for where the HTTP APIs are implemented.

## Database

The storage controller uses a postgres database to persist a subset of its state. Note that the storage controller does _not_ keep all its state in the database: this is a design choice to enable most operations to be done efficiently in memory, rather than having to read from the database. See `persistence.rs` for a more comprehensive comment explaining what we do and do not persist: a useful metaphor is that we persist objects like tenants and nodes, but we do not
persist the _relationships_ between them: the attachment state of a tenant's shards to nodes is kept in memory and
rebuilt on startup.

The file `persistence.rs` contains all the code for accessing the database, and has a large doc comment that goes into more detail about exactly what we persist and why.

The `diesel` crate is used for defining models & migrations.

Running a local cluster with `cargo neon` automatically starts a vanilla postgress process to host the storage controller’s database.

### Diesel tip: migrations

If you need to modify the database schema, here’s how to create a migration:

- Install the diesel CLI with `cargo install diesel_cli`
- Use `diesel migration generate <name>` to create a new migration
- Populate the SQL files in the `migrations/` subdirectory
- Use `DATABASE_URL=... diesel migration run` to apply the migration you just wrote: this will update the `[schema.rs](http://schema.rs)` file automatically.
  - This requires a running database: the easiest way to do that is to just run `cargo neon init ; cargo neon start`, which will leave a database available at `postgresql://localhost:1235/storage_controller`
- Commit the migration files and the changes to schema.rs
- If you need to iterate, you can rewind migrations with `diesel migration revert -a` and then `diesel migration run` again.
- The migrations are build into the storage controller binary, and automatically run at startup after it is deployed, so once you’ve committed a migration no further steps are needed.

## storcon_cli

The `storcon_cli` tool enables interactive management of the storage controller. This is usually
only necessary for debug, but may also be used to manage nodes (e.g. marking a node as offline).

`storcon_cli --help` includes details on commands.

# Deploying

This section is aimed at engineers deploying the storage controller outside of Neon's cloud platform, as
part of a self-hosted system.

_General note: since the default `neon_local` environment includes a storage controller, this is a useful
reference when figuring out deployment._

## Database

It is **essential** that the database used by the storage controller is durable (**do not store it on ephemeral
local disk**). This database contains pageserver generation numbers, which are essential to data safety on the pageserver.

The resource requirements for the database are very low: a single CPU core and 1GiB of memory should work well for most deployments. The physical size of the database is typically under a gigabyte.

Set the URL to the database using the `--database-url` CLI option.

There is no need to run migrations manually: the storage controller automatically applies migrations
when it starts up.

## Configure pageservers to use the storage controller

1. The pageserver `control_plane_api` and `control_plane_api_token` should be set in the `pageserver.toml` file. The API setting should
   point to the "upcall" prefix, for example `http://127.0.0.1:1234/upcall/v1/` is used in neon_local clusters.
2. Create a `metadata.json` file in the same directory as `pageserver.toml`: this enables the pageserver to automatically register itself
   with the storage controller when it starts up. See the example below for the format of this file.

### Example `metadata.json`

```
{"host":"acmehost.localdomain","http_host":"acmehost.localdomain","http_port":9898,"port":64000}
```

- `port` and `host` refer to the _postgres_ port and host, and these must be accessible from wherever
  postgres runs.
- `http_port` and `http_host` refer to the pageserver's HTTP api, this must be accessible from where
  the storage controller runs.

## Handle compute notifications.

The storage controller independently moves tenant attachments between pageservers in response to
changes such as a pageserver node becoming unavailable, or the tenant's shard count changing. To enable
postgres clients to handle such changes, the storage controller calls an API hook when a tenant's pageserver
location changes.

The hook is configured using the storage controller's `--compute-hook-url` CLI option. If the hook requires
JWT auth, the token may be provided with `--control-plane-jwt-token`. The hook will be invoked with a `PUT` request.

In the Neon cloud service, this hook is implemented by Neon's internal cloud control plane. In `neon_local` systems
the storage controller integrates directly with neon_local to reconfigure local postgres processes instead of calling
the compute hook.

When implementing an on-premise Neon deployment, you must implement a service that handles the compute hook. This is not complicated:
the request body has format of the `ComputeHookNotifyRequest` structure, provided below for convenience.

```
struct ComputeHookNotifyRequestShard {
    node_id: NodeId,
    shard_number: ShardNumber,
}

struct ComputeHookNotifyRequest {
    tenant_id: TenantId,
    stripe_size: Option<ShardStripeSize>,
    shards: Vec<ComputeHookNotifyRequestShard>,
}
```

When a notification is received:

1. Modify postgres configuration for this tenant:

   - set `neon.pageserver_connstr` to a comma-separated list of postgres connection strings to pageservers according to the `shards` list. The
     shards identified by `NodeId` must be converted to the address+port of the node.
   - if stripe_size is not None, set `neon.stripe_size` to this value

2. Send SIGHUP to postgres to reload configuration
3. Respond with 200 to the notification request. Do not return success if postgres was not updated: if an error is returned, the controller
   will retry the notification until it succeeds..

### Example notification body

```
{
  "tenant_id": "1f359dd625e519a1a4e8d7509690f6fc",
  "stripe_size": 32768,
  "shards": [
      {"node_id": 344, "shard_number": 0},
      {"node_id": 722, "shard_number": 1},
  ],
}
```


# Content from file ../neon/docs/synthetic-size.md:

# Synthetic size

Neon storage has copy-on-write branching, which makes it difficult to
answer the question "how large is my database"? To give one reasonable
answer, we calculate _synthetic size_ for a project.

The calculation is called "synthetic", because it is based purely on
the user-visible logical size, which is the size that you would see on
a standalone PostgreSQL installation, and the amount of WAL, which is
also the same as what you'd see on a standalone PostgreSQL, for the
same set of updates.

The synthetic size does *not* depend on the actual physical size
consumed in the storage, or implementation details of the Neon storage
like garbage collection, compaction and compression.  There is a
strong *correlation* between the physical size and the synthetic size,
but the synthetic size is designed to be independent of the
implementation details, so that any improvements we make in the
storage system simply reduce our COGS. And vice versa: any bugs or bad
implementation where we keep more data than we would need to, do not
change the synthetic size or incur any costs to the user.

The synthetic size is calculated for the whole project. It is not
straightforward to attribute size to individual branches. See [What is
the size of an individual branch?](#what-is-the-size-of-an-individual-branch)
for a discussion of those difficulties.

The synthetic size is designed to:

- Take into account the copy-on-write nature of the storage. For
  example, if you create a branch, it doesn't immediately add anything
  to the synthetic size. It starts to affect the synthetic size only
  as it diverges from the parent branch.

- Be independent of any implementation details of the storage, like
  garbage collection, remote storage, or compression.

## Terms & assumptions

- logical size is the size of a branch *at a given point in
  time*. It's the total size of all tables in all databases, as you
  see with "\l+" in psql for example, plus the Postgres SLRUs and some
  small amount of metadata. Note that currently, Neon does not include
  the SLRUs and metadata in the logical size. Refer to the comment in
  [`get_current_logical_size_non_incremental()`](/pageserver/src/pgdatadir_mapping.rs#L813-L814).

- a "point in time" is defined as an LSN value. You can convert a
  timestamp to an LSN, but the storage internally works with LSNs.

- PITR horizon can be set per-branch.

- PITR horizon can be set as a time interval, e.g. 5 days or hours, or
  as amount of WAL, in bytes.  If it's given as a time interval, it's
  converted to an LSN for the calculation.

- PITR horizon can be set to 0, if you don't want to retain any history.

## Calculation

Inputs to the calculation are:
- logical size of the database at different points in time,
- amount of WAL generated, and
- the PITR horizon settings

The synthetic size is based on an idealistic model of the storage
system, where we pretend that the storage consists of two things:
- snapshots, containing a full snapshot of the database, at a given
  point in time, and
- WAL.

In the simple case that the project contains just one branch (main),
and a fixed PITR horizon, the synthetic size is the sum of:

- the logical size of the branch *at the beginning of the PITR
  horizon*, i.e. at the oldest point that you can still recover to, and
- the size of the WAL covering the PITR horizon.

The snapshot allows you to recover to the beginning of the PITR
horizon, and the WAL allows you to recover from that point to any
point within the horizon.

```
                             WAL
   -----------------------#########>
                          ^
                       snapshot

Legend:
  ##### PITR horizon. This is the region that you can still access
        with Point-in-time query and you can still create branches
        from.
  ----- history that has fallen out of the PITR horizon, and can no
        longer be accessed
```

NOTE: This is not how the storage system actually works! The actual
implementation is also based on snapshots and WAL, but the snapshots
are taken for individual database pages and ranges of pages rather
than the whole database, and it is much more complicated. This model
is a reasonable approximation, however, to make the synthetic size a
useful proxy for the actual storage consumption.


## Example: Data is INSERTed

For example, let's assume that your database contained 10 GB of data
at the beginning of the PITR horizon, and you have since then inserted
5 GB of additional data into it. The additional insertions of 5 GB of
data consume roughly 5 GB of WAL. In that case, the synthetic size is:

> 10 GB (snapshot) +  5 GB (WAL) = 15 GB

If you now set the PITR horizon on the project to 0, so that no
historical data is retained, then the beginning PITR horizon would be
at the end of the branch, so the size of the snapshot would be
calculated at the end of the branch, after the insertions. Then the
synthetic size is:

> 15 GB (snapshot) + 0 GB (WAL) = 15 GB.

In this case, the synthetic size is the same, regardless of the PITR horizon,
because all the history consists of inserts. The newly inserted data takes
up the same amount of space, whether it's stored as part of the logical
snapshot, or as WAL. (*)

(*) This is a rough approximation. In reality, the WAL contains
headers and other overhead, and on the other hand, the logical
snapshot includes empty space on pages, so the size of insertions in
WAL can be smaller or greater than the size of the final table after
the insertions. But in most cases, it's in the same ballpark.

## Example: Data is DELETEd

Let's look at another example:

Let's start again with a database that contains 10 GB of data. Then,
you DELETE 5 GB of the data, and run VACUUM to free up the space, so
that the logical size of the database is now only 5 GB.

Let's assume that the WAL for the deletions and the vacuum take up
100 MB of space. In that case, the synthetic size of the project is:

> 10 GB (snapshot) + 100 MB (WAL) = 10.1 GB

This is much larger than the logical size of the database after the
deletions (5 GB). That's because the system still needs to retain the
deleted data, because it's still accessible to queries and branching
in the PITR window.

If you now set the PITR horizon to 0 or just wait for time to pass so
that the data falls out of the PITR horizon, making the deleted data
inaccessible, the synthetic size shrinks:

> 5 GB (snapshot) + 0 GB (WAL) = 5 GB


# Branching

Things get more complicated with branching. Branches in Neon are
copy-on-write, which is also reflected in the synthetic size.

When you create a branch, it doesn't immediately change the synthetic
size at all. The branch point is within the PITR horizon, and all the
data needed to recover to that point in time needs to be retained
anyway.

However, if you make modifications on the branch, the system needs to
keep the WAL of those modifications. The WAL is included in the
synthetic size.

## Example: branch and INSERT

Let's assume that you again start with a 10 GB database.
On the main branch, you insert 2 GB of data. Then you create
a branch at that point, and insert another 3 GB of data on the
main branch, and 1 GB of data on the child branch

```
  child                 +#####>
                        |
                        |    WAL
  main    ---------###############>
                   ^
                snapshot
```

In this case, the synthetic size consists of:
- the snapshot at the beginning of the PITR horizon (10 GB)
- the WAL on the main branch (2 GB + 3 GB = 5 GB)
- the WAL on the child branch (1 GB)

Total: 16 GB

# Diverging branches

If there is only a small amount of changes in the database on the
different branches, as in the previous example, the synthetic size
consists of a snapshot before the branch point, containing all the
shared data, and the WAL on both branches. However, if the branches
diverge a lot, it is more efficient to store a separate snapshot of
branches.

## Example: diverging branches

You start with a 10 GB database. You insert 5 GB of data on the main
branch. Then you create a branch, and immediately delete all the data
on the child branch and insert 5 GB of new data to it. Then you do the
same on the main branch. Let's assume
that the PITR horizon requires keeping the last 1 GB of WAL on the
both branches.

```
                              snapshot
                                  v     WAL
  child                 +---------##############>
                        |
                        |
  main     -------------+---------##############>
                                  ^     WAL
                              snapshot
```

In this case, the synthetic size consists of:
- snapshot at the beginning of the PITR horizon on the main branch (4 GB)
- WAL on the main branch (1 GB)
- snapshot at the beginning of the PITR horizon on the child branch (4 GB)
- last 1 GB of WAL on the child branch (1 GB)

Total: 10 GB

The alternative way to store this would be to take only one snapshot
at the beginning of branch point, and keep all the WAL on both
branches.  However, the size with that method would be larger, as it
would require one 10 GB snapshot, and 5 GB + 5 GB of WAL. It depends
on the amount of changes (WAL) on both branches, and the logical size
at the branch point, which method would result in a smaller synthetic
size. On each branch point, the system performs the calculation with
both methods, and uses the method that is cheaper, i.e. the one that
results in a smaller synthetic size.

One way to think about this is that when you create a branch, it
starts out as a thin branch that only stores the WAL since the branch
point.  As you modify it, and the amount of WAL grows, at some point
it becomes cheaper to store a completely new snapshot of the branch
and truncate the WAL.


# What is the size of an individual branch?

Synthetic size is calculated for the whole project, and includes all
branches. There is no such thing as the size of a branch, because it
is not straightforward to attribute the parts of size to individual
branches.

## Example: attributing size to branches

(copied from https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/pull/2884#discussion_r1029365278)

Imagine that you create two branches, A and B, at the same point from
main branch, and do a couple of small updates on both branches. Then
six months pass, and during those six months the data on the main
branch churns over completely multiple times. The retention period is,
say 1 month.

```
                      +------> A
                     /
--------------------*-------------------------------> main
                     \
                      +--------> B
```

In that situation, the synthetic tenant size would be calculated based
on a "logical snapshot" at the branch point, that is, the logical size
of the database at that point. Plus the WAL on branches A and B. Let's
say that the snapshot size is 10 GB, and the WAL is 1 MB on both
branches A and B. So the total synthetic storage size is 10002
MB. (Let's ignore the main branch for now, that would be just added to
the sum)

How would you break that down per branch? I can think of three
different ways to do it, and all of them have their own problems:

### Subtraction method

For each branch, calculate how much smaller the total synthetic size
would be, if that branch didn't exist. In other words, how much would
you save if you dropped the branch. With this method, the size of
branches A and B is 1 MB.

With this method, the 10 GB shared logical snapshot is not included
for A nor B. So the size of all branches is not equal to the total
synthetic size of the tenant. If you drop branch A, you save 1 MB as
you'd expect, but also the size of B suddenly jumps from 1 MB to 10001
MB, which might feel surprising.

### Division method

Divide the common parts evenly across all branches that need
them. With this method, the size of branches A and B would be 5001 MB.

With this method, the sum of all branches adds up to the total
synthetic size. But it's surprising in other ways: if you drop branch
A, you might think that you save 5001 MB, but in reality you only save
1 MB, and the size of branch B suddenly grows from 5001 to 10001 MB.

### Addition method

For each branch, include all the snapshots and WAL that it depends on,
even if some of them are shared by other branches. With this method,
the size of branches A and B would be 10001 MB.

The surprise with this method is that the sum of all the branches is
larger than the total synthetic size. And if you drop branch A, the
total synthetic size doesn't fall by 10001 MB as you might think.

# Alternatives

A sort of cop-out method would be to show the whole tree of branches
graphically, and for each section of WAL or logical snapshot, display
the size of that section. You can then see which branches depend on
which sections, which sections are shared etc. That would be good to
have in the UI anyway.

Or perhaps calculate per-branch numbers using the subtraction method,
and in addition to that, one more number for "shared size" that
includes all the data that is needed by more than one branch.

## Which is the right method?

The bottom line is that it's not straightforward to attribute the
synthetic size to individual branches. There are things we can do, and
all of those methods are pretty straightforward to implement, but they
all have their own problems. What makes sense depends a lot on what
you want to do with the number, what question you are trying to
answer.

# Useful development tools

This readme contains some hints on how to set up some optional development tools.

## ccls

[ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) is a c/c++ language server. It requires some setup
to work well. There are different ways to do it but here's what works for me:
1. Make a common parent directory for all your common neon projects. (for example, `~/src/neondatabase/`)
2. Go to `vendor/postgres-v15`
3. Run `make clean && ./configure`
4. Install [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear), and run `bear -- make -j4`
5. Copy the generated `compile_commands.json` to `~/src/neondatabase` (or equivalent)
6. Run `touch ~/src/neondatabase/.ccls-root` this will make the `compile_commands.json` file discoverable in all subdirectories

With this setup you will get decent lsp mileage inside the postgres repo, and also any postgres extensions that you put in `~/src/neondatabase/`, like `pg_embedding`, or inside `~/src/neondatabase/neon/pgxn` as well.

Some additional tips for various IDEs:

### Emacs

To improve performance: `(setq lsp-lens-enable nil)`

    git commit --amend --no-edit
    git push --force origin
    ```

1. Merge the pull request after getting approval(s) and CI completion.


# Content from file ../neon/docs/walservice.md:

# WAL service

The neon WAL service acts as a holding area and redistribution
center for recently generated WAL. The primary Postgres server streams
the WAL to the WAL safekeeper, and treats it like a (synchronous)
replica. A replication slot is used in the primary to prevent the
primary from discarding WAL that hasn't been streamed to the WAL
service yet.

```
+--------------+              +------------------+
|              |     WAL      |                  |
| Compute node |  ----------> |   WAL Service    |
|              |              |                  |
+--------------+              +------------------+

                                     | WAL
                                     |
                                     |
                                     V
                              +--------------+
                              |              |
                              | Pageservers  |
                              |              |
                              +--------------+
```


The WAL service consists of multiple WAL safekeepers that all store a
copy of the WAL. A WAL record is considered durable when the majority
of safekeepers have received and stored the WAL to local disk. A
consensus algorithm based on Paxos is used to manage the quorum.

```
  +-------------------------------------------+
  | WAL Service                               |

  +-------------------------------------------+
```

The primary connects to the WAL safekeepers, so it works in a "push"
fashion.  That's different from how streaming replication usually
works, where the replica initiates the connection. To do that, there
is a component called the "WAL proposer". The WAL proposer is a
background worker that runs in the primary Postgres server. It
connects to the WAL safekeeper, and sends all the WAL. (PostgreSQL's
archive_commands works in the "push" style, but it operates on a WAL
segment granularity. If PostgreSQL had a push style API for streaming,
WAL propose could be implemented using it.)

The Page Server connects to the WAL safekeeper, using the same
streaming replication protocol that's used between Postgres primary
and standby. You can also connect the Page Server directly to a
primary PostgreSQL node for testing.

In a production installation, there are multiple WAL safekeepers
running on different nodes, and there is a quorum mechanism using the
Paxos algorithm to ensure that a piece of WAL is considered as durable
only after it has been flushed to disk on more than half of the WAL
safekeepers. The Paxos and crash recovery algorithm ensures that only
one primary node can be actively streaming WAL to the quorum of
safekeepers.

See [this section](safekeeper-protocol.md) for a more detailed description of
the consensus protocol. spec/ contains TLA+ specification of it.

# Q&A

Q: Why have a separate service instead of connecting Page Server directly to a
   primary PostgreSQL node?
A: Page Server is a single server which can be lost. As our primary
   fault-tolerant storage is S3, we do not want to wait for it before
   committing a transaction. The WAL service acts as a temporary fault-tolerant
   storage for recent data before it gets to the Page Server and then finally
   to S3. Whenever WALs and pages are committed to S3, WAL's storage can be
   trimmed.

Q: What if the compute node evicts a page, needs it back, but the page is yet
   to reach the Page Server?
A: If the compute node has evicted a page, changes to it have been WAL-logged
   (that's why it is called Write Ahead logging; there are some exceptions like
   index builds, but these are exceptions). These WAL records will eventually
   reach the Page Server. The Page Server notes that the compute node requests
   pages with a very recent LSN and will not respond to the compute node until a
   corresponding WAL is received from WAL safekeepers.

Q: How long may Page Server wait for?
A: Not too long, hopefully. If a page is evicted, it probably was not used for
   a while, so the WAL service have had enough time to push changes to the Page
   Server. To limit the lag, tune backpressure using `max_replication_*_lag` settings.

Q: How do WAL safekeepers communicate with each other?
A: They may only send each other messages via the compute node, they never
   communicate directly with each other.

Q: Why have a consensus algorithm if there is only a single compute node?
A: Actually there may be moments with multiple PostgreSQL nodes running at the
   same time. E.g. we are bringing one up and one down. We would like to avoid
   simultaneous writes from different nodes, so there should be a consensus on
   who is the primary node.

# Terminology

WAL service - The service as whole that ensures that WAL is stored durably.

WAL safekeeper - One node that participates in the quorum. All the safekeepers
together form the WAL service.

WAL acceptor, WAL proposer - In the context of the consensus algorithm, the Postgres
compute node is also known as the WAL proposer, and the safekeeper is also known
as the acceptor. Those are the standard terms in the Paxos algorithm.


# Content from file ../neon/libs/desim/README.md:

# Discrete Event SIMulator

This is a library for running simulations of distributed systems. The main idea is borrowed from [FoundationDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc).

Each node runs as a separate thread. This library was not optimized for speed yet, but it's already much faster than running usual intergration tests in real time, because it uses virtual simulation time and can fast-forward time to skip intervals where all nodes are doing nothing but sleeping or waiting for something.

The original purpose for this library is to test walproposer and safekeeper implementation working together, in a scenarios close to the real world environment. This simulator is determenistic and can inject failures in networking without waiting minutes of wall-time to trigger timeout, which makes it easier to find bugs in our consensus implementation compared to using integration tests.


# Content from file ../neon/libs/postgres_ffi/README.md:

This module contains utilities for working with PostgreSQL file
formats. It's a collection of structs that are auto-generated from the
PostgreSQL header files using bindgen, and Rust functions to read and
manipulate them.

There are also a bunch of constants in `pg_constants.rs` that are copied
from various PostgreSQL headers, rather than auto-generated. They mostly
should be auto-generated too, but that's a TODO.

The PostgreSQL on-disk file format is not portable across different
CPU architectures and operating systems. It is also subject to change
in each major PostgreSQL version. Currently, this module supports
PostgreSQL v14, v15 and v16: bindings and code that depends on them are
version-specific.
This code is organized in modules `postgres_ffi::v14`, `postgres_ffi::v15` and
`postgres_ffi::v16`. Version independent code is explicitly exported into
shared `postgres_ffi`.


TODO: Currently, there is also some code that deals with WAL records
in pageserver/src/waldecoder.rs.  That should be moved into this
module. The rest of the codebase should not have intimate knowledge of
PostgreSQL file formats or WAL layout, that knowledge should be
encapsulated in this module.


# Content from file ../neon/libs/proxy/README.md:

This directory contains libraries that are specific for proxy.

Currently, it contains a signficant fork/refactoring of rust-postgres that no longer reflects the API
of the original library. Since it was so significant, it made sense to upgrade it to it's own set of libraries.

Proxy needs unique access to the protocol, which explains why such heavy modifications were necessary.

# Content from file ../neon/libs/vm_monitor/README.md:

# `vm-monitor`

The `vm-monitor` (or just monitor) is a core component of the autoscaling system,
along with the `autoscale-scheduler` and the `autoscaler-agent`s. The monitor has
two primary roles: 1) notifying agents when immediate upscaling is necessary due
to memory conditions and 2) managing Postgres' file cache and a cgroup to carry
out upscaling and downscaling decisions.

## More on scaling

We scale CPU and memory using NeonVM, our in-house QEMU tool for use with Kubernetes.
To control thresholds for receiving memory usage notifications, we start Postgres
in the `neon-postgres` cgroup and set its `memory.{max,high}`.

* See also: [`neondatabase/autoscaling`](https://github.com/neondatabase/autoscaling/)
* See also: [`neondatabase/vm-monitor`](https://github.com/neondatabase/vm-monitor/),
where initial development of the monitor happened. The repository is no longer
maintained but the commit history may be useful for debugging.

## Structure

The `vm-monitor` is loosely comprised of a few systems. These are:
* the server: this is just a simple `axum` server that accepts requests and
upgrades them to websocket connections. The server only allows one connection at
a time. This means that upon receiving a new connection, the server will terminate
and old one if it exists.
* the filecache: a struct that allows communication with the Postgres file cache.
On startup, we connect to the filecache and hold on to the connection for the
entire monitor lifetime.
* the cgroup watcher: the `CgroupWatcher` polls the `neon-postgres` cgroup's memory
usage and sends rolling aggregates to the runner.
* the runner: the runner marries the filecache and cgroup watcher together,
communicating with the agent throught the `Dispatcher`, and then calling filecache
and cgroup watcher functions as needed to upscale and downscale

# Content from file ../neon/pageserver/compaction/TODO.md:

# TODO

- If the key space can be perfectly partitioned at some key, perform planning on each
  partition separately. For example, if we are compacting a level with layers like this:

  ```
              :
  +--+ +----+ :  +------+
  |  | |    | :  |      |
  +--+ +----+ :  +------+
              :
  +-----+ +-+ : +--------+
  |     | | | : |        |
  +-----+ +-+ : +--------+
              :
  ```

  At the dotted line, there is a natural split in the key space, such that all
  layers are either on the left or the right of it. We can compact the
  partitions separately.  We could choose to create image layers for one
  partition but not the other one, for example.

- All the layers don't have to be exactly the same size, we can choose to cut a
  layer short or stretch it a little larger than the target size, if it helps
  the overall system. We can help perfect partitions (see previous bullet point)
  to happen more frequently, by choosing the cut points wisely. For example, try
  to cut layers at boundaries of underlying image layers. And "snap to grid",
  i.e. don't cut layers at any key, but e.g. only when key % 10000 = 0.

- Avoid rewriting layers when we'd just create an identical layer to an input
  layer.

- Parallelism. The code is already split up into planning and execution, so that
  we first split up the compaction work into "Jobs", and then execute them.
  It would be straightforward to execute multiple jobs in parallel.

- Materialize extra pages in delta layers during compaction. This would reduce
  read amplification. There has been the idea of partial image layers. Materializing
  extra pages in the delta layers achieve the same goal, without introducing a new
  concept.

## Simulator

- Expand the simulator for more workloads
- Automate a test suite that runs the simluator with different workloads and
  spits out a table of results
- Model read amplification
- More sanity checking. One idea is to keep a reference count of each
  MockRecord, i.e. use Arc<MockRecord> instead of plain MockRecord, and panic if
  a MockRecord that is newer than PITR horizon is completely dropped. That would
  indicate that the record was lost.

This ANN extension of Postgres is based
on [ivf-hnsw](https://github.com/dbaranchuk/ivf-hnsw.git) implementation of [HNSW](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/hnsw),
the code for the current state-of-the-art billion-scale nearest neighbor search system presented in the paper:

# Postgres extension

HNSW index is hold in memory (built on demand) and it's maxial size is limited
by `maxelements` index parameter. Another required parameter is nubmer of dimensions (if it is not specified in column type).
Optional parameter `ef` specifies number of neighbors which are considered during index construction and search (corresponds `efConstruction` and `efSearch` parameters
described in the article).

# Example of usage:

```
create extension hnsw;
create table embeddings(id integer primary key, payload real[]);
create index on embeddings using hnsw(payload) with (maxelements=1000000, dims=100, m=32);
select id from embeddings order by payload <-> array[1.0, 2.0,...] limit 100;

neon extension consists of several parts:

### shared preload library `neon.so`

- implements storage manager API and network communications with remote page server.

- walproposer: implements broadcast protocol between postgres and WAL safekeepers.

- control plane connector:  Captures updates to roles/databases using ProcessUtility_hook and sends them to the control ProcessUtility_hook.

- remote extension server: Request compute_ctl to download extension files.

- file_cache: Local file cache is used to temporary store relations pages in local file system for better performance.

- relsize_cache: Relation size cache for better neon performance.

### SQL functions in `neon--*.sql`

Utility functions to expose neon specific information to user and metrics collection.
This extension is created in all databases in the cluster by default.

Also proxy can expose following services to the external world:

* postgres protocol over TCP -- usual postgres endpoint compatible with usual
  postgres drivers
* postgres protocol over WebSockets -- same protocol tunneled over websockets
  for environments where TCP connection is not available. We have our own
  implementation of a client that uses node-postgres and tunnels traffic through
  websockets: https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless
* SQL over HTTP -- service that accepts POST requests with SQL text over HTTP
  and responds with JSON-serialised results.


## SQL over HTTP

Contrary to the usual postgres proto over TCP and WebSockets using plain
one-shot HTTP request achieves smaller amortized latencies in edge setups due to
fewer round trips and an enhanced open connection reuse by the v8 engine. Also
such endpoint could be used directly without any driver.

To play with it locally one may start proxy over a local postgres installation
(see end of this page on how to generate certs with openssl):

```
./target/debug/proxy -c server.crt -k server.key --auth-backend=postgres --auth-endpoint=postgres://stas@127.0.0.1:5432/stas --wss 0.0.0.0:4444
```

If both postgres and proxy are running you may send a SQL query:
```console
curl -k -X POST 'https://proxy.localtest.me:4444/sql' \
  -H 'Neon-Connection-String: postgres://stas:pass@proxy.localtest.me:4444/postgres' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "query":"SELECT $1::int[] as arr, $2::jsonb as obj, 42 as num",
    "params":[ "{{1,2},{\"3\",4}}", {"key":"val", "ikey":4242}]
  }' | jq
```
```json
{
  "command": "SELECT",
  "fields": [
    { "dataTypeID": 1007, "name": "arr" },
    { "dataTypeID": 3802, "name": "obj" },
    { "dataTypeID": 23, "name": "num" }
  ],
  "rowCount": 1,
  "rows": [
    {
      "arr": [[1,2],[3,4]],
      "num": 42,
      "obj": {
        "ikey": 4242,
        "key": "val"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


With the current approach we made the following design decisions:

1. SQL injection protection: We employed the extended query protocol, modifying
   the rust-postgres driver to send queries in one roundtrip using a text
   protocol rather than binary, bypassing potential issues like those identified
   in sfackler/rust-postgres#1030.

2. Postgres type compatibility: As not all postgres types have binary
   representations (e.g., acl's in pg_class), we adjusted rust-postgres to
   respond with text protocol, simplifying serialization and fixing queries with
   text-only types in response.

3. Data type conversion: Considering JSON supports fewer data types than
   Postgres, we perform conversions where possible, passing all other types as
   strings. Key conversions include:
   - postgres int2, int4, float4, float8 -> json number (NaN and Inf remain
     text)
   - postgres bool, null, text -> json bool, null, string
   - postgres array -> json array
   - postgres json and jsonb -> json object

4. Alignment with node-postgres: To facilitate integration with js libraries,
   we've matched the response structure of node-postgres, returning command tags
   and column oids. Command tag capturing was added to the rust-postgres
   functionality as part of this change.

### Output options

User can pass several optional headers that will affect resulting json.

1. `Neon-Raw-Text-Output: true`. Return postgres values as text, without parsing them. So numbers, objects, booleans, nulls and arrays will be returned as text. That can be useful in cases when client code wants to implement it's own parsing or reuse parsing libraries from e.g. node-postgres.
2. `Neon-Array-Mode: true`. Return postgres rows as arrays instead of objects. That is more compact representation and also helps in some edge
cases where it is hard to use rows represented as objects (e.g. when several fields have the same name).


## Using SNI-based routing on localhost

Now proxy determines project name from the subdomain, request to the `round-rice-566201.somedomain.tld` will be routed to the project named `round-rice-566201`. Unfortunately, `/etc/hosts` does not support domain wildcards, so I usually use `*.localtest.me` which resolves to `127.0.0.1`. Now we can create self-signed certificate and play with proxy:

```sh
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -text -out server.crt -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=*.localtest.me"
```

start proxy

```sh
./target/debug/proxy -c server.crt -k server.key
```

and connect to it

```sh
PGSSLROOTCERT=./server.crt psql 'postgres://my-cluster-42.localtest.me:1234?sslmode=verify-full'
```

# Content from file ../neon/scripts/sk_cleanup_tenants/readme.md:

# Cleanup script for safekeeper

This script can be used to remove tenant directories on safekeepers for projects which do not longer exist (deleted in console).

To run this script you need to upload it to safekeeper (i.e. with SSH), and run it with python3. Ansible can be used to run this script on multiple safekeepers.

NOTE: Console queries to check that project is deleted are slow and inefficient.
If you want to run this script on safekeeper with many tenants, consider
making PR to console repo to make projects search by tenant_id faster.

## How to run on a single node

```
zsh nsh safekeeper-0.us-east-2.aws.neon.build

ls /storage/safekeeper/data/ | grep -v safekeeper > tenants.txt

mkdir -p /storage/neon-trash/2023-01-01--cleanup

 export CONSOLE_API_TOKEN=
python3 script.py --trash-dir /storage/neon-trash/2023-01-01--cleanup --safekeeper-id $(cat /storage/safekeeper/data/safekeeper.id) --safekeeper-host $HOSTNAME --dry-run

cat tenants.txt | python3 script.py --trash-dir /storage/neon-trash/2023-01-01--cleanup --safekeeper-id $(cat /storage/safekeeper/data/safekeeper.id) --safekeeper-host $HOSTNAME --dry-run

cat tenants.txt | python3 script.py --trash-dir /storage/neon-trash/2023-01-01--cleanup --safekeeper-id $(cat /storage/safekeeper/data/safekeeper.id) --safekeeper-host $HOSTNAME |& tee logs.txt
```

## How to use ansible (staging)

```
cd ~/neon/.github/ansible

export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=dev

ansible-playbook -i staging.us-east-2.hosts.yaml -e @ssm_config ../../scripts/sk_cleanup_tenants/remote.yaml

# add --extra-vars "api_token=" to set console api token
```

## How to use ansible (prod)

- Change `endpoint` in `script.py` to "https://console.neon.tech/api"

```
cd ~/neon/.github/ansible

export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=prod

ansible-playbook -i prod.us-east-2.hosts.yaml -e @ssm_config ../../scripts/sk_cleanup_tenants/remote.yaml

# add --extra-vars "api_token=" to set console api token
```


> Heavily inspired with script for pageserver cleanup: https://gist.github.com/problame/bafb6ca6334f0145757238e61380c3f1/9bef1845a8291ebfa1f3a51eb79c01d12498b2b5

# Content from file ../neon/scripts/sk_collect_dumps/readme.md:

# Collect /v1/debug_dump from all safekeeper nodes

3. Issue admin token (add/remove .stage from url for staging/prod and setting proper API key):
```
# staging:
AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl https://console-stage.neon.build/regions/console/api/v1/admin/issue_token -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_STAGING_KEY" -X POST -d '{"ttl_seconds": 43200, "scope": "safekeeperdata"}' 2>/dev/null | jq --raw-output '.jwt')
# prod:
AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl https://console.neon.tech/regions/console/api/v1/admin/issue_token -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_PROD_KEY" -X POST -d '{"ttl_seconds": 43200, "scope": "safekeeperdata"}' 2>/dev/null | jq --raw-output '.jwt')
# check
echo $AUTH_TOKEN
```
2. Run ansible playbooks to collect .json dumps from all safekeepers and store them in `./result` directory.

There are two ways to do that, with ssm or tsh. ssm:
```
# in aws repo, cd .github/ansible and run e.g. (adjusting profile and region in vars and limit):
AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=dev ansible-playbook -i inventory_aws_ec2.yaml -i staging.us-east-2.vars.yaml -e @ssm_config -l 'safekeeper:&us_east_2' -e "auth_token=${AUTH_TOKEN}" ~/neon/neon/scripts/sk_collect_dumps/remote.yaml
```
It will put the results to .results directory *near the playbook*.

tsh:

Update the inventory, if needed, selecting .build/.tech and optionally region:
```
rm -f hosts && echo '[safekeeper]' >> hosts
# staging:
tsh ls | awk '{print $1}' | grep safekeeper | grep "neon.build" | grep us-east-2 >> hosts
# prod:
tsh ls | awk '{print $1}' | grep safekeeper | grep "neon.tech" | grep us-east-2 >> hosts
```

Test ansible connection:
```
ansible all -m ping -v
```

Download the dumps:
```
mkdir -p result && rm -f result/*
ansible-playbook -e "auth_token=${AUTH_TOKEN}" remote.yaml
```

3. Run `DB_CONNSTR=... ./upload.sh prod_feb30` to upload dumps to `prod_feb30` table in specified postgres database.


# Content from file ../neon/storage_scrubber/README.md:

# Neon Storage Scrubber

This tool directly accesses the S3 buckets used by the Neon `pageserver`
and `safekeeper`, and does housekeeping such as cleaning up objects for tenants & timelines that no longer exist.

## Usage

### Generic Parameters

#### S3

Do `aws sso login --profile dev` to get the SSO access to the bucket to clean.
Also, set the following environment variables:

- `AWS_PROFILE`: Profile name to use for accessing S3 buckets (e.g. `dev`)
- `REGION`: A region where the bucket is located at.
- `BUCKET`: Bucket name
- `BUCKET_PREFIX` (optional): Prefix inside the bucket

#### Console API

_This section is only relevant if using a command that requires access to Neon's internal control plane_

- `CLOUD_ADMIN_API_URL`: The URL base to use for checking tenant/timeline for existence via the Cloud API.  e.g. `https://<admin host>/admin`

- `CLOUD_ADMIN_API_TOKEN`: The token to provide when querying the admin API. Get one on the corresponding console page, e.g. `https://<admin host>/app/settings/api-keys`

### Commands

#### `find-garbage`

Walk an S3 bucket and cross-reference the contents with the Console API to identify data for
tenants or timelines that should no longer exist.

- `--node-kind`: whether to inspect safekeeper or pageserver bucket prefix
- `--depth`: whether to only search for deletable tenants, or also search for
  deletable timelines within active tenants. Default: `tenant`
- `--output-path`: filename to write garbage list to.  Default `garbage.json`

This command outputs a JSON file describing tenants and timelines to remove, for subsequent
processing by the `purge-garbage` subcommand.

**Note that the garbage list format is not stable.  The output of `find-garbage` is only
  intended for use by the exact same version of the tool running `purge-garbage`**

Example:

`env AWS_PROFILE=dev REGION=eu-west-1 BUCKET=my-dev-bucket CLOUD_ADMIN_API_TOKEN=[client_key] CLOUD_ADMIN_API_URL=[url] cargo run --release -- find-garbage --node-kind=pageserver --depth=tenant --output-path=eu-west-1-garbage.json`

Note that `CLOUD_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` can be obtained from https://console-stage.neon.build/app/settings/api-keys (for staging) or https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys for production. This is not the control plane admin JWT key. The env var name is confusing. Though anyone can generate that API key, you still need admin permission in order to access all projects in the region.

And note that `CLOUD_ADMIN_API_URL` should include the region in the admin URL due to the control plane / console split. For example, `https://console-stage.neon.build/regions/aws-us-east-2/api/v1/admin` for the staging us-east-2 region.

#### `purge-garbage`

Consume a garbage list from `find-garbage`, and delete the related objects in the S3 bucket.

- `--input-path`: filename to read garbage list from.  Default `garbage.json`.
- `--mode`: controls whether to purge only garbage that was specifically marked
            deleted in the control plane (`deletedonly`), or also to purge tenants/timelines
            that were not present in the control plane at all (`deletedandmissing`)

This command learns region/bucket details from the garbage file, so it is not necessary
to pass them on the command line

Example:

`env AWS_PROFILE=dev cargo run --release -- purge-garbage --input-path=eu-west-1-garbage.json`

Add the `--delete` argument before `purge-garbage` to enable deletion.  This is intentionally
not provided inline in the example above to avoid accidents.  Without the `--delete` flag
the purge command will log all the keys that it would have deleted.

#### `scan-metadata`

Walk objects in a pageserver or safekeeper S3 bucket, and report statistics on the contents and checking consistency.
Errors are logged to stderr and summary to stdout.

For pageserver:
```
env AWS_PROFILE=dev REGION=eu-west-1 BUCKET=my-dev-bucket CLOUD_ADMIN_API_TOKEN=${NEON_CLOUD_ADMIN_API_STAGING_KEY} CLOUD_ADMIN_API_URL=[url] cargo run --release -- scan-metadata --node-kind pageserver

Timelines: 31106
With errors: 3
With warnings: 13942
With garbage: 0
Index versions: 2: 13942, 4: 17162
Timeline size bytes: min 22413312, 1% 52133887, 10% 56459263, 50% 101711871, 90% 191561727, 99% 280887295, max 167535558656
Layer size bytes: min 24576, 1% 36879, 10% 36879, 50% 61471, 90% 44695551, 99% 201457663, max 275324928
Timeline layer count: min 1, 1% 3, 10% 6, 50% 16, 90% 25, 99% 39, max 1053
```

For safekeepers, dump_db_connstr and dump_db_table must be
specified; they should point to table with debug dump which will be used
to list timelines and find their backup and start LSNs.

## Cleaning up running pageservers

If S3 state is altered first manually, pageserver in-memory state will contain wrong data about S3 state, and tenants/timelines may get recreated on S3 (due to any layer upload due to compaction, pageserver restart, etc.). So before proceeding, for tenants/timelines which are already deleted in the console, we must remove these from pageservers.

First, we need to group pageservers by buckets, `https://<admin host>/admin/pageservers` can be used for all env nodes, then `cat /storage/pageserver/data/pageserver.toml` on every node will show the bucket names and regions needed.

Per bucket, for every pageserver id related, find deleted tenants:

`curl -X POST "https://<admin_host>/admin/check_pageserver/{id}" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NEON_CLOUD_ADMIN_API_STAGING_KEY}" | jq`

use `?check_timelines=true` to find deleted timelines, but the check runs a separate query on every alive tenant, so that could be long and time out for big pageservers.

Note that some tenants/timelines could be marked as deleted in console, but console might continue querying the node later to fully remove the tenant/timeline: wait for some time before ensuring that the "extra" tenant/timeline is not going away by itself.

When all IDs are collected, manually go to every pageserver and detach/delete the tenant/timeline.
In future, the cleanup tool may access pageservers directly, but now it's only console and S3 it has access to.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-0b8ef2fcad60da9d/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-0b8ef2fcad60da9d/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-0b8ef2fcad60da9d/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-57af2ff6e422bc2e/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-57af2ff6e422bc2e/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-57af2ff6e422bc2e/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-6f5fc6627034d5aa/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-6f5fc6627034d5aa/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-6f5fc6627034d5aa/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

Note: this document is markdown with embedded LaTeX; different markdown renderers may not produce the expected output.  Viewing with `pandoc -s PROFILING_INTERNALS.md -o PROFILING_INTERNALS.pdf` is recommended.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-7326ca451095963e/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-7326ca451095963e/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-7326ca451095963e/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-75fedc58bdad9193/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-75fedc58bdad9193/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-d766ba3e52809d66/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-d766ba3e52809d66/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-d766ba3e52809d66/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-f527b50ff3190f7b/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-f527b50ff3190f7b/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/debug/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-f527b50ff3190f7b/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/target/release/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-85780710a32b3be5/out/build/INSTALL.md:

Building and installing a packaged release of jemalloc can be as simple as
typing the following while in the root directory of the source tree:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If building from unpackaged developer sources, the simplest command sequence
that might work is:

    ./autogen.sh
    make
    make install

You can uninstall the installed build artifacts like this:

    make uninstall

Notes:
 - "autoconf" needs to be installed
 - Documentation is built by the default target only when xsltproc is
available.  Build will warn but not stop if the dependency is missing.


## Advanced configuration

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which
functionality is enabled, where jemalloc is installed, etc.  Optionally, pass
any of the following arguments (not a definitive list) to 'configure':

* `--help`

    Print a definitive list of options.

* `--prefix=<install-root-dir>`

    Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

    will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib,
    and /usr/local/man.

* `--with-version=(<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid>|VERSION)`

    The VERSION file is mandatory for successful configuration, and the
    following steps are taken to assure its presence:
    1) If --with-version=<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>-<nrev>-g<gid> is specified,
       generate VERSION using the specified value.
    2) If --with-version is not specified in either form and the source
       directory is inside a git repository, try to generate VERSION via 'git
       describe' invocations that pattern-match release tags.
    3) If VERSION is missing, generate it with a bogus version:
       0.0.0-0-g0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

    Note that --with-version=VERSION bypasses (1) and (2), which simplifies
    VERSION configuration when embedding a jemalloc release into another
    project's git repository.

* `--with-rpath=<colon-separated-rpath>`

    Embed one or more library paths, so that libjemalloc can find the libraries
    it is linked to.  This works only on ELF-based systems.

* `--with-mangling=<map>`

    Mangle public symbols specified in <map> which is a comma-separated list of
    name:mangled pairs.

    For example, to use ld's --wrap option as an alternative method for
    overriding libc's malloc implementation, specify something like:

      --with-mangling=malloc:__wrap_malloc,free:__wrap_free[...]

    Note that mangling happens prior to application of the prefix specified by
    --with-jemalloc-prefix, and mangled symbols are then ignored when applying
    the prefix.

* `--with-jemalloc-prefix=<prefix>`

    Prefix all public APIs with <prefix>.  For example, if <prefix> is
    "prefix_", API changes like the following occur:

      malloc()         --> prefix_malloc()
      malloc_conf      --> prefix_malloc_conf
      /etc/malloc.conf --> /etc/prefix_malloc.conf
      MALLOC_CONF      --> PREFIX_MALLOC_CONF

    This makes it possible to use jemalloc at the same time as the system
    allocator, or even to use multiple copies of jemalloc simultaneously.

    By default, the prefix is "", except on OS X, where it is "je_".  On OS X,
    jemalloc overlays the default malloc zone, but makes no attempt to actually
    replace the "malloc", "calloc", etc. symbols.

* `--without-export`

    Don't export public APIs.  This can be useful when building jemalloc as a
    static library, or to avoid exporting public APIs when using the zone
    allocator on OSX.

* `--with-private-namespace=<prefix>`

    Prefix all library-private APIs with <prefix>je_.  For shared libraries,
    symbol visibility mechanisms prevent these symbols from being exported, but
    for static libraries, naming collisions are a real possibility.  By
    default, <prefix> is empty, which results in a symbol prefix of je_ .

* `--with-install-suffix=<suffix>`

    Append <suffix> to the base name of all installed files, such that multiple
    versions of jemalloc can coexist in the same installation directory.  For
    example, libjemalloc.so.0 becomes libjemalloc<suffix>.so.0.

* `--with-malloc-conf=<malloc_conf>`

    Embed `<malloc_conf>` as a run-time options string that is processed prior to
    the malloc_conf global variable, the /etc/malloc.conf symlink, and the
    MALLOC_CONF environment variable.  For example, to change the default decay
    time to 30 seconds:

      --with-malloc-conf=decay_ms:30000

* `--enable-debug`

    Enable assertions and validation code.  This incurs a substantial
    performance hit, but is very useful during application development.

* `--disable-stats`

    Disable statistics gathering functionality.  See the "opt.stats_print"
    option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-prof`

    Enable heap profiling and leak detection functionality.  See the "opt.prof"
    option documentation for usage details.  When enabled, there are several
    approaches to backtracing, and the configure script chooses the first one
    in the following list that appears to function correctly:

    + libunwind      (requires --enable-prof-libunwind)
    + libgcc         (unless --disable-prof-libgcc)
    + gcc intrinsics (unless --disable-prof-gcc)

* `--enable-prof-libunwind`

    Use the libunwind library (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/) for stack
    backtracing.

* `--disable-prof-libgcc`

    Disable the use of libgcc's backtracing functionality.

* `--disable-prof-gcc`

    Disable the use of gcc intrinsics for backtracing.

* `--with-static-libunwind=<libunwind.a>`

    Statically link against the specified libunwind.a rather than dynamically
    linking with -lunwind.

* `--disable-fill`

    Disable support for junk/zero filling of memory.  See the "opt.junk" and
    "opt.zero" option documentation for usage details.

* `--disable-zone-allocator`

    Disable zone allocator for Darwin.  This means jemalloc won't be hooked as
    the default allocator on OSX/iOS.

* `--enable-utrace`

    Enable utrace(2)-based allocation tracing.  This feature is not broadly
    portable (FreeBSD has it, but Linux and OS X do not).

* `--enable-xmalloc`

    Enable support for optional immediate termination due to out-of-memory
    errors, as is commonly implemented by "xmalloc" wrapper function for malloc.
    See the "opt.xmalloc" option documentation for usage details.

* `--enable-lazy-lock`

    Enable code that wraps pthread_create() to detect when an application
    switches from single-threaded to multi-threaded mode, so that it can avoid
    mutex locking/unlocking operations while in single-threaded mode.  In
    practice, this feature usually has little impact on performance unless
    thread-specific caching is disabled.

* `--disable-cache-oblivious`

    Disable cache-oblivious large allocation alignment by default, for large
    allocation requests with no alignment constraints.  If this feature is
    disabled, all large allocations are page-aligned as an implementation
    artifact, which can severely harm CPU cache utilization.  However, the
    cache-oblivious layout comes at the cost of one extra page per large
    allocation, which in the most extreme case increases physical memory usage
    for the 16 KiB size class to 20 KiB.

* `--disable-syscall`

    Disable use of syscall(2) rather than {open,read,write,close}(2).  This is
    intended as a workaround for systems that place security limitations on
    syscall(2).

* `--disable-cxx`

    Disable C++ integration.  This will cause new and delete operator
    implementations to be omitted.

* `--with-xslroot=<path>`

    Specify where to find DocBook XSL stylesheets when building the
    documentation.

* `--with-lg-page=<lg-page>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the allocator page size, which must in turn be at
    least as large as the system page size.  By default the configure script
    determines the host's page size and sets the allocator page size equal to
    the system page size, so this option need not be specified unless the
    system page size may change between configuration and execution, e.g. when
    cross compiling.

* `--with-lg-hugepage=<lg-hugepage>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the system huge page size.  This option is useful
    when cross compiling, or when overriding the default for systems that do
    not explicitly support huge pages.

* `--with-lg-quantum=<lg-quantum>`

    Specify the base 2 log of the minimum allocation alignment.  jemalloc needs
    to know the minimum alignment that meets the following C standard
    requirement (quoted from the April 12, 2011 draft of the C11 standard):

    >  The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so
      that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a
      fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object
      or an array of such objects in the space allocated [...]

    This setting is architecture-specific, and although jemalloc includes known
    safe values for the most commonly used modern architectures, there is a
    wrinkle related to GNU libc (glibc) that may impact your choice of
    <lg-quantum>.  On most modern architectures, this mandates 16-byte
    alignment (<lg-quantum>=4), but the glibc developers chose not to meet this
    requirement for performance reasons.  An old discussion can be found at
    <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=206> .  Unlike glibc,
    jemalloc does follow the C standard by default (caveat: jemalloc
    technically cheats for size classes smaller than the quantum), but the fact
    that Linux systems already work around this allocator noncompliance means
    that it is generally safe in practice to let jemalloc's minimum alignment
    follow glibc's lead.  If you specify `--with-lg-quantum=3` during
    configuration, jemalloc will provide additional size classes that are not
    16-byte-aligned (24, 40, and 56).

* `--with-lg-vaddr=<lg-vaddr>`

    Specify the number of significant virtual address bits.  By default, the
    configure script attempts to detect virtual address size on those platforms
    where it knows how, and picks a default otherwise.  This option may be
    useful when cross-compiling.

* `--disable-initial-exec-tls`

    Disable the initial-exec TLS model for jemalloc's internal thread-local
    storage (on those platforms that support explicit settings).  This can allow
    jemalloc to be dynamically loaded after program startup (e.g. using dlopen).
    Note that in this case, there will be two malloc implementations operating
    in the same process, which will almost certainly result in confusing runtime
    crashes if pointers leak from one implementation to the other.

* `--disable-libdl`

    Disable the usage of libdl, namely dlsym(3) which is required by the lazy
    lock option.  This can allow building static binaries.

The following environment variables (not a definitive list) impact configure's
behavior:

* `CFLAGS="?"`
* `CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C/C++ compiler.  Any flags set by the configure
    script are prepended, which means explicitly set flags generally take
    precedence.  Take care when specifying flags such as -Werror, because
    configure tests may be affected in undesirable ways.

* `EXTRA_CFLAGS="?"`
* `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS="?"`

    Append these flags to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS, without passing them to the
    compiler(s) during configuration.  This makes it possible to add flags such
    as -Werror, while allowing the configure script to determine what other
    flags are appropriate for the specified configuration.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed to
    'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use
    CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"`

    'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    'configure' uses this to find programs.

In some cases it may be necessary to work around configuration results that do
not match reality.  For example, Linux 4.5 added support for the MADV_FREE flag
to madvise(2), which can cause problems if building on a host with MADV_FREE
support and deploying to a target without.  To work around this, use a cache
file to override the relevant configuration variable defined in configure.ac,
e.g.:

    echo "je_cv_madv_free=no" > config.cache && ./configure -C


## Advanced compilation

To build only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    build_lib_shared
    build_lib_static
    build_lib
    build_doc_html
    build_doc_man
    build_doc

To install only parts of jemalloc, use the following targets:

    install_bin
    install_include
    install_lib_shared
    install_lib_static
    install_lib_pc
    install_lib
    install_doc_html
    install_doc_man
    install_doc

To clean up build results to varying degrees, use the following make targets:

    clean
    distclean
    relclean


## Advanced installation

Optionally, define make variables when invoking make, including (not
exclusively):

* `INCLUDEDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

* `LIBDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for libraries.

* `MANDIR="?"`

    Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

* `DESTDIR="?"`

    Prepend DESTDIR to INCLUDEDIR, LIBDIR, DATADIR, and MANDIR.  This is useful
    when installing to a different path than was specified via --prefix.

* `CC="?"`

    Use this to invoke the C compiler.

* `CFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the compiler.

* `CPPFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

* `LDFLAGS="?"`

    Pass these flags when linking.

* `PATH="?"`

    Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.


## Development

If you intend to make non-trivial changes to jemalloc, use the 'autogen.sh'
script rather than 'configure'.  This re-generates 'configure', enables
configuration dependency rules, and enables re-generation of automatically
generated source files.

The build system supports using an object directory separate from the source
tree.  For example, you can create an 'obj' directory, and from within that
directory, issue configuration and build commands:

    autoconf
    mkdir obj
    cd obj
    ../configure --enable-autogen
    make


## Documentation

The manual page is generated in both html and roff formats.  Any web browser
can be used to view the html manual.  The roff manual page can be formatted
prior to installation via the following command:

    nroff -man -t doc/jemalloc.3


# Content from file ../neon/target/release/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-85780710a32b3be5/out/build/TUNING.md:

This document summarizes the common approaches for performance fine tuning with
jemalloc (as of 5.3.0).  The default configuration of jemalloc tends to work
reasonably well in practice, and most applications should not have to tune any
options. However, in order to cover a wide range of applications and avoid
pathological cases, the default setting is sometimes kept conservative and
suboptimal, even for many common workloads.  When jemalloc is properly tuned for
a specific application / workload, it is common to improve system level metrics
by a few percent, or make favorable trade-offs.


## Notable runtime options for performance tuning

Runtime options can be set via
[malloc_conf](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#tuning).

* [background_thread](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#background_thread)

    Enabling jemalloc background threads generally improves the tail latency for
    application threads, since unused memory purging is shifted to the dedicated
    background threads.  In addition, unintended purging delay caused by
    application inactivity is avoided with background threads.

    Suggested: `background_thread:true` when jemalloc managed threads can be
    allowed.

* [metadata_thp](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.metadata_thp)

    Allowing jemalloc to utilize transparent huge pages for its internal
    metadata usually reduces TLB misses significantly, especially for programs
    with large memory footprint and frequent allocation / deallocation
    activities.  Metadata memory usage may increase due to the use of huge
    pages.

    Suggested for allocation intensive programs: `metadata_thp:auto` or
    `metadata_thp:always`, which is expected to improve CPU utilization at a
    small memory cost.

* [dirty_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.dirty_decay_ms) and
  [muzzy_decay_ms](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.muzzy_decay_ms)

    Decay time determines how fast jemalloc returns unused pages back to the
    operating system, and therefore provides a fairly straightforward trade-off
    between CPU and memory usage.  Shorter decay time purges unused pages faster
    to reduces memory usage (usually at the cost of more CPU cycles spent on
    purging), and vice versa.

    Suggested: tune the values based on the desired trade-offs.

* [narenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.narenas)

    By default jemalloc uses multiple arenas to reduce internal lock contention.
    However high arena count may also increase overall memory fragmentation,
    since arenas manage memory independently.  When high degree of parallelism
    is not expected at the allocator level, lower number of arenas often
    improves memory usage.

    Suggested: if low parallelism is expected, try lower arena count while
    monitoring CPU and memory usage.

* [percpu_arena](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#opt.percpu_arena)

    Enable dynamic thread to arena association based on running CPU.  This has
    the potential to improve locality, e.g. when thread to CPU affinity is
    present.
    
    Suggested: try `percpu_arena:percpu` or `percpu_arena:phycpu` if
    thread migration between processors is expected to be infrequent.

Examples:

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing CPU utilization:

    `background_thread:true,metadata_thp:auto` combined with relaxed decay time
    (increased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:30000,muzzy_decay_ms:30000`).

* High resource consumption application, prioritizing memory usage:

    `background_thread:true,tcache_max:4096` combined with shorter decay time
    (decreased `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,
    e.g. `dirty_decay_ms:5000,muzzy_decay_ms:5000`), and lower arena count
    (e.g. number of CPUs).

* Low resource consumption application:

    `narenas:1,tcache_max:1024` combined with shorter decay time (decreased
    `dirty_decay_ms` and / or `muzzy_decay_ms`,e.g.
    `dirty_decay_ms:1000,muzzy_decay_ms:0`).

* Extremely conservative -- minimize memory usage at all costs, only suitable when
allocation activity is very rare:

    `narenas:1,tcache:false,dirty_decay_ms:0,muzzy_decay_ms:0`

Note that it is recommended to combine the options with `abort_conf:true` which
aborts immediately on illegal options.

## Beyond runtime options

In addition to the runtime options, there are a number of programmatic ways to
improve application performance with jemalloc.

* [Explicit arenas](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arenas.create)

    Manually created arenas can help performance in various ways, e.g. by
    managing locality and contention for specific usages.  For example,
    applications can explicitly allocate frequently accessed objects from a
    dedicated arena with
    [mallocx()](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#MALLOCX_ARENA) to improve
    locality.  In addition, explicit arenas often benefit from individually
    tuned options, e.g. relaxed [decay
    time](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.dirty_decay_ms) if
    frequent reuse is expected.

* [Extent hooks](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#arena.i.extent_hooks)

    Extent hooks allow customization for managing underlying memory.  One use
    case for performance purpose is to utilize huge pages -- for example,
    [HHVM](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/util/alloc.cpp)
    uses explicit arenas with customized extent hooks to manage 1GB huge pages
    for frequently accessed data, which reduces TLB misses significantly.

* [Explicit thread-to-arena
  binding](http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#thread.arena)

    It is common for some threads in an application to have different memory
    access / allocation patterns.  Threads with heavy workloads often benefit
    from explicit binding, e.g. binding very active threads to dedicated arenas
    may reduce contention at the allocator level.


# Content from file ../neon/target/release/build/tikv-jemalloc-sys-85780710a32b3be5/out/build/doc_internal/PROFILING_INTERNALS.md:

# jemalloc profiling
This describes the mathematical basis behind jemalloc's profiling implementation, as well as the implementation tricks that make it effective. Historically, the jemalloc profiling design simply copied tcmalloc's. The implementation has since diverged, due to both the desire to record additional information, and to correct some biasing bugs.

## Some tricks in our implementation toolbag

### Sampling
Recording our metadata is quite expensive; we need to walk up the stack to get a stack trace. On top of that, we need to allocate storage to record that stack trace, and stick it somewhere where a profile-dumping call can find it. That call might happen on another thread, so we'll probably need to take a lock to do so. These costs are quite large compared to the average cost of an allocation. To manage this, we'll only sample some fraction of allocations. This will miss some of them, so our data will be incomplete, but we'll try to make up for it. We can tune our sampling rate to balance accuracy and performance.

### Fast Bernoulli sampling
Compared to our fast paths, even a `coinflip(p)` function can be quite expensive. Having to do a random-number generation and some floating point operations would be a sizeable relative cost. However (as pointed out in [[Vitter, 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/23002.23003)]), if we can orchestrate our algorithm so that many of our `coinflip` calls share their parameter value, we can do better. We can sample from the geometric distribution, and initialize a counter with the result. When the counter hits 0, the `coinflip` function returns true (and reinitializes its internal counter).
This can let us do a random-number generation once per (logical) coinflip that comes up heads, rather than once per (logical) coinflip. Since we expect to sample relatively rarely, this can be a large win.

### Fast-path / slow-path thinking
Most programs have a skewed distribution of allocations. Smaller allocations are much more frequent than large ones, but shorter lived and less common as a fraction of program memory. "Small" and "large" are necessarily sort of fuzzy terms, but if we define "small" as "allocations jemalloc puts into slabs" and "large" as the others, then it's not uncommon for small allocations to be hundreds of times more frequent than large ones, but take up around half the amount of heap space as large ones. Moreover, small allocations tend to be much cheaper than large ones (often by a factor of 20-30): they're more likely to hit in thread caches, less likely to have to do an mmap, and cheaper to fill (by the user) once the allocation has been returned.

## An unbiased estimator of space consumption from (almost) arbitrary sampling strategies
Suppose we have a sampling strategy that meets the following criteria:

  - One allocation being sampled is independent of other allocations being sampled.
  - Each allocation has a non-zero probability of being sampled.

We can then estimate the bytes in live allocations through some particular stack trace as:

$$ \sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]} $$

where the sum ranges over some index variable of live allocations from that stack, $S_i$ is the size of the $i$'th allocation, and $I_i$ is an indicator random variable for whether or not the $i'th$ allocation is sampled. $S_i$ and $\mathrm{E}[I_i]$ are constants (the program allocations are fixed; the random variables are the sampling decisions), so taking the expectation we get

$$ \sum_i S_i \mathrm{E}[I_i] \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.$$

This is of course $\sum_i S_i$, as we want (and, a similar calculation could be done for allocation counts as well).
This is a fairly general strategy; note that while we require that sampling decisions be independent of one another's outcomes, they don't have to be independent of previous allocations, total bytes allocated, etc. You can imagine strategies that:

  - Sample allocations at program startup at a higher rate than subsequent allocations
  - Sample even-indexed allocations more frequently than odd-indexed ones (so long as no allocation has zero sampling probability)
  - Let threads declare themselves as high-sampling-priority, and sample their allocations at an increased rate.

These can all be fit into this framework to give an unbiased estimator.

## Evaluating sampling strategies
Not all strategies for picking allocations to sample are equally good, of course. Among unbiased estimators, the lower the variance, the lower the mean squared error. Using the estimator above, the variance is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Var}[\sum_i S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}]  \\
=& \sum_i \mathrm{Var}[S_i I_i \frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{Var}[I_i] \\
=& \sum_i \frac{S_i^2}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]^2} \mathrm{E}[I_i](1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]) \\
=& \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \mathrm{E}[I_i]}{\mathrm{E}[I_i]}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use this formula to compare various strategy choices. All else being equal, lower-variance strategies are better.

## Possible sampling strategies
Because of the desire to avoid the fast-path costs, we'd like to use our Bernoulli trick if possible. There are two obvious counters to use: a coinflip per allocation, and a coinflip per byte allocated.

### Bernoulli sampling per-allocation
An obvious strategy is to pick some large $N$, and give each allocation a $1/N$ chance of being sampled. This would let us use our Bernoulli-via-Geometric trick. Using the formula from above, we can compute the variance as:

$$ \sum_i S_i^2 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{N}}{\frac{1}{N}}  = (N-1) \sum_i S_i^2.$$

That is, an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of $(N-1)Z^2$ to the variance.

### Bernoulli sampling per-byte
Another option we have is to pick some rate $R$, and give each byte a $1/R$ chance of being picked for sampling (at which point we would sample its contained allocation). The chance of an allocation of size $Z$ being sampled, then, is

$$1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}$$

and an allocation of size $Z$ contributes a term of

$$Z^2 \frac{(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}{1-(1-\frac{1}{R})^{Z}}.$$

In practical settings, $R$ is large, and so this is well-approximated by

$$Z^2 \frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} .$$

Just to get a sense of the dynamics here, let's look at the behavior for various values of $Z$. When $Z$ is small relative to $R$, we can use $e^z \approx 1 + x$, and conclude that the variance contributed by a small-$Z$ allocation is around

$$Z^2 \frac{1-Z/R}{Z/R} \approx RZ.$$

When $Z$ is comparable to $R$, the variance term is near $Z^2$ (we have $\frac{e^{-Z/R}}{1 - e^{-Z/R}} = 1$ when $Z/R = \ln 2 \approx 0.693$). When $Z$ is large relative to $R$, the variance term goes to zero.

## Picking a sampling strategy
The fast-path/slow-path dynamics of allocation patterns point us towards the per-byte sampling approach:

  - The quadratic increase in variance per allocation in the first approach is quite costly when heaps have a non-negligible portion of their bytes in those allocations, which is practically often the case.
  - The Bernoulli-per-byte approach shifts more of its samples towards large allocations, which are already a slow-path.
  - We drive several tickers (e.g. tcache gc) by bytes allocated, and report bytes-allocated as a user-visible statistic, so we have to do all the necessary bookkeeping anyways.

Indeed, this is the approach we use in jemalloc. Our heap dumps record the size of the allocation and the sampling rate $R$, and jeprof unbiases by dividing by $1 - e^{-Z/R}$.  The framework above would suggest dividing by $1-(1-1/R)^Z$; instead, we use the fact that $R$ is large in practical situations, and so $e^{-Z/R}$ is a good approximation (and faster to compute).  (Equivalently, we may also see this as the factor that falls out from viewing sampling as a Poisson process directly).

## Consequences for heap dump consumers
Using this approach means that there are a few things users need to be aware of.

### Stack counts are not proportional to allocation frequencies
If one stack appears twice as often as another, this by itself does not imply that it allocates twice as often. Consider the case in which there are only two types of allocating call stacks in a program. Stack A allocates 8 bytes, and occurs a million times in a program. Stack B allocates 8 MB, and occurs just once in a program. If our sampling rate $R$ is about 1MB, we expect stack A to show up about 8 times, and stack B to show up once. Stack A isn't 8 times more frequent than stack B, though; it's a million times more frequent.

### Aggregation must be done after unbiasing samples
Some tools manually parse heap dump output, and aggregate across stacks (or across program runs) to provide wider-scale data analyses. When doing this aggregation, though, it's important to unbias-and-then-sum, rather than sum-and-then-unbias. Reusing our example from the previous section: suppose we collect heap dumps of the program from a million machines. We then have 8 million occurs of stack A (each of 8 bytes), and a million occurrences of stack B (each of 8 MB). If we sum first, we'll attribute 64 MB to stack A, and 8 TB to stack B. Unbiasing changes these numbers by an infinitesimal amount, so that sum-then-unbias dramatically underreports the amount of memory allocated by stack A.

## An avenue for future exploration
While the framework we laid out above is pretty general, as an engineering decision we're only interested in fairly simple approaches (i.e. ones for which the chance of an allocation being sampled depends only on its size). Our job is then: for each size class $Z$, pick a probability $p_Z$ that an allocation of that size will be sampled. We made some handwave-y references to statistical distributions to justify our choices, but there's no reason we need to pick them that way. Any set of non-zero probabilities is a valid choice.
The real limiting factor in our ability to reduce estimator variance is that fact that sampling is expensive; we want to make sure we only do it on a small fraction of allocations. Our goal, then, is to pick the $p_Z$ to minimize variance given some maximum sampling rate $P$. If we define $a_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$, and $l_Z$ to be the fraction of allocations of size $Z$ still alive at the time of a heap dump, then we can phrase this as an optimization problem over the choices of $p_Z$:

Minimize

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1-p_Z}{p_Z} $$

subject to

$$ \sum_Z a_Z p_Z \leq P $$

Ignoring a term that doesn't depend on $p_Z$, the objective is minimized whenever

$$ \sum_Z Z^2 l_Z \frac{1}{p_Z} $$

is. For a particular program, $l_Z$ and $a_Z$ are just numbers that can be obtained (exactly) from existing stats introspection facilities, and we have a fairly tractable convex optimization problem (it can be framed as a second-order cone program). It would be interesting to evaluate, for various common allocation patterns, how well our current strategy adapts. Do our actual choices for $p_Z$ closely correspond to the optimal ones? How close is the variance of our choices to the variance of the optimal strategy?
You can imagine an implementation that actually goes all the way, and makes $p_Z$ selections a tuning parameter. I don't think this is a good use of development time for the foreseeable future; but I do wonder about the answers to some of these questions.

## Implementation realities

The nice story above is at least partially a lie. Initially, jeprof (copying its logic from pprof)  had the sum-then-unbias error described above.  The current version of jemalloc does the unbiasing step on a per-allocation basis internally, so that we're always tracking what the unbiased numbers "should" be.  The problem is, actually surfacing those unbiased numbers would require a breaking change to jeprof (and the various already-deployed tools that have copied its logic). Instead, we use a little bit more trickery. Since we know at dump time the numbers we want jeprof to report, we simply choose the values we'll output so that the jeprof numbers will match the true numbers.  The math is described in `src/prof_data.c` (where the only cleverness is a change of variables that lets the exponentials fall out).

This has the effect of making the output of jeprof (and related tools) correct, while making its inputs incorrect.  This can be annoying to human readers of raw profiling dump output.


# Content from file ../neon/test_runner/README.md:

## Neon test runner

This directory contains integration tests.

Prerequisites:
- Correctly configured Python, see [`/docs/sourcetree.md`](/docs/sourcetree.md#using-python)
- Neon and Postgres binaries
    - See the root [README.md](/README.md) for build directions
      To run tests you need to add `--features testing` to Rust code build commands.
      For convenience, repository cargo config contains `build_testing` alias, that serves as a subcommand, adding the required feature flags.
      Usage example: `cargo build_testing --release` is equivalent to `cargo build --features testing --release`
    - Tests can be run from the git tree; or see the environment variables
      below to run from other directories.
- The neon git repo, including the postgres submodule
  (for some tests, e.g. `pg_regress`)

### Test Organization

Regression tests are in the 'regress' directory. They can be run in
parallel to minimize total runtime. Most regression test sets up their
environment with its own pageservers and safekeepers.

'pg_clients' contains tests for connecting with various client
libraries. Each client test uses a Dockerfile that pulls an image that
contains the client, and connects to PostgreSQL with it. The client
tests can be run against an existing PostgreSQL or Neon installation.

'performance' contains performance regression tests. Each test
exercises a particular scenario or workload, and outputs
measurements. They should be run serially, to avoid the tests
interfering with the performance of each other. Some performance tests
set up their own Neon environment, while others can be run against an
existing PostgreSQL or Neon environment.

### Running the tests

There is a wrapper script to invoke pytest: `./scripts/pytest`.
It accepts all the arguments that are accepted by pytest.
Depending on your installation options pytest might be invoked directly.

Test state (postgres data, pageserver state, and log files) will
be stored under a directory `test_output`.

You can run all the tests with:

`./scripts/pytest`

If you want to run all the tests in a particular file:

`./scripts/pytest test_pgbench.py`

If you want to run all tests that have the string "bench" in their names:

`./scripts/pytest -k bench`

To run tests in parellel we utilize `pytest-xdist` plugin. By default everything runs single threaded. Number of workers can be specified with `-n` argument:

`./scripts/pytest -n4`

By default performance tests are excluded. To run them explicitly pass performance tests selection to the script:

`./scripts/pytest test_runner/performance`

Useful environment variables:

`NEON_BIN`: The directory where neon binaries can be found.
`COMPATIBILITY_NEON_BIN`: The directory where the previous version of Neon binaries can be found
`POSTGRES_DISTRIB_DIR`: The directory where postgres distribution can be found.
Since pageserver supports several postgres versions, `POSTGRES_DISTRIB_DIR` must contain
a subdirectory for each version with naming convention `v{PG_VERSION}/`.
Inside that dir, a `bin/postgres` binary should be present.
`COMPATIBILITY_POSTGRES_DISTRIB_DIR`: The directory where the prevoius version of postgres distribution can be found.
`DEFAULT_PG_VERSION`: The version of Postgres to use,
This is used to construct full path to the postgres binaries.
Format is 2-digit major version nubmer, i.e. `DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=16`
`TEST_OUTPUT`: Set the directory where test state and test output files
should go.
`RUST_LOG`: logging configuration to pass into Neon CLI

Useful parameters and commands:

`--preserve-database-files` to preserve pageserver (layer) and safekeer (segment) timeline files on disk
after running a test suite. Such files might be large, so removed by default; but might be useful for debugging or creation of svg images with layer file contents. If `NeonEnvBuilder#preserve_database_files` set to `True` for a particular test, the whole `repo` directory will be attached to Allure report (thus uploaded to S3) as `everything.tar.zst` for this test.

Let stdout, stderr and `INFO` log messages go to the terminal instead of capturing them:
`./scripts/pytest -s --log-cli-level=INFO ...`
(Note many tests capture subprocess outputs separately, so this may not
show much.)

Exit after the first test failure:
`./scripts/pytest -x ...`
(there are many more pytest options; run `pytest -h` to see them.)

#### Running Python tests against real S3 or S3-compatible services

Neon's `libs/remote_storage` supports multiple implementations of remote storage.
At the time of writing, that is
```rust
pub enum RemoteStorageKind {
    /// Storage based on local file system.
    /// Specify a root folder to place all stored files into.
    LocalFs(Utf8PathBuf),
    /// AWS S3 based storage, storing all files in the S3 bucket
    /// specified by the config
    AwsS3(S3Config),
    /// Azure Blob based storage, storing all files in the container
    /// specified by the config
    AzureContainer(AzureConfig),
}
```

The test suite has a Python enum with equal name but different meaning:

```python
@enum.unique
class RemoteStorageKind(StrEnum):
    LOCAL_FS = "local_fs"
    MOCK_S3 = "mock_s3"
    REAL_S3 = "real_s3"
```

* `LOCAL_FS` => `LocalFs`
* `MOCK_S3`: starts [`moto`](https://github.com/getmoto/moto)'s S3 implementation, then configures Pageserver with `AwsS3`
* `REAL_S3` => configure `AwsS3` as detailed below

When a test in the test suite needs an `AwsS3`, it is supposed to call `remote_storage.s3_storage()`.
That function checks env var `ENABLE_REAL_S3_REMOTE_STORAGE`:
* If it is not set, use `MOCK_S3`
* If it is set, use `REAL_S3`.

For `REAL_S3`, the test suite creates the dict/toml representation of the `RemoteStorageKind::AwsS3` based on env vars:

```rust
pub struct S3Config {
    // test suite env var: REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET
    pub bucket_name: String,
    // test suite env var: REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_REGION
    pub bucket_region: String,
    // test suite determines this
    pub prefix_in_bucket: Option<String>,
    // no env var exists; test suite sets it for MOCK_S3, because that's how moto works
    pub endpoint: Option<String>,
    ...
}
```

*Credentials* are not part of the config, but discovered by the AWS SDK.
See the `libs/remote_storage` Rust code.
We're documenting two mechanism here:

The test suite supports two mechanisms (`remote_storage.py`):

**Credential mechanism 1**: env vars `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
Populate the env vars with AWS access keys that you created in IAM.
Our CI uses this mechanism.
However, it is _not_ recommended for interactive use by developers ([learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-users.html#credentials-long-term)).
Instead, use profiles (next section).

**Credential mechanism 2**: env var `AWS_PROFILE`.
This uses the AWS SDK's (and CLI's) profile mechanism.
Learn more about it [in the official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html).
After configuring a profile (e.g. via the aws CLI), set the env var to its name.

In conclusion, the full command line is:

```bash
# with long-term AWS access keys
ENABLE_REAL_S3_REMOTE_STORAGE=true \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=mybucket \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=eu-central-1 \
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... \
./scripts/pytest
```
<!-- Don't forget to update the Minio example when changing these -->
```bash
# with AWS PROFILE
ENABLE_REAL_S3_REMOTE_STORAGE=true \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=mybucket \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=eu-central-1 \
AWS_PROFILE=... \
./scripts/pytest
```

If you're using SSO, make sure to `aws sso login --profile $AWS_PROFILE` first.

##### Minio

If you want to run test without the cloud setup, we recommend [minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html).

```bash
# Start in Terminal 1
mkdir /tmp/minio_data
minio server /tmp/minio_data --console-address 127.0.0.1:9001 --address 127.0.0.1:9000
```

In another terminal, create an `aws` CLI profile for it:

```ini
# append to ~/.aws/config
[profile local-minio]
services = local-minio-services
[services local-minio-services]
s3 =
  endpoint_url=http://127.0.0.1:9000/
```


Now configure the credentials (this is going to write `~/.aws/credentials` for you).
It's an interactive prompt.

```bash
# Terminal 2
$ aws --profile local-minio configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: minioadmin
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: minioadmin
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:
```

Now create a bucket `testbucket` using the CLI.

```bash
# (don't forget to have AWS_PROFILE env var set; or use --profile)
aws --profile local-minio s3 mb s3://mybucket
```

(If it doesn't work, make sure you update your AWS CLI to a recent version.
 The [service-specific endpoint feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-ss-endpoints.html)
 that we're using is quite new.)

```bash
# with AWS PROFILE
ENABLE_REAL_S3_REMOTE_STORAGE=true \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=mybucket \
REMOTE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=doesntmatterforminio \
AWS_PROFILE=local-minio \
./scripts/pytest
```

NB: you can avoid the `--profile` by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` variable.
Just like the AWS SDKs, the `aws` CLI is sensible to it.

#### Running Rust tests against real S3 or S3-compatible services

We have some Rust tests that only run against real S3, e.g., [here](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/c18d3340b5e3c978a81c3db8b6f1e83cd9087e8a/libs/remote_storage/tests/test_real_s3.rs#L392-L397).

They use the same env vars as the Python test suite (see previous section)
but interpret them on their own.
However, at this time, the interpretation is identical.

So, above instructions apply to the Rust test as well.

### Writing a test

Every test needs a Neon Environment, or NeonEnv to operate in. A Neon Environment
is like a little cloud-in-a-box, and consists of a Pageserver, 0-N Safekeepers, and
compute Postgres nodes. The connections between them can be configured to use JWT
authentication tokens, and some other configuration options can be tweaked too.

The easiest way to get access to a Neon Environment is by using the `neon_simple_env`
fixture. For convenience, there is a branch called `main` in environments created with
'neon_simple_env', ready to be used in the test.

For more complicated cases, you can build a custom Neon Environment, with the `neon_env`
fixture:

```python
def test_foobar(neon_env_builder: NeonEnvBuilder):
    # Prescribe the environment.
    # We want to have 3 safekeeper nodes, and use JWT authentication in the
    # connections to the page server
    neon_env_builder.num_safekeepers = 3
    neon_env_builder.set_pageserver_auth(True)

    # Now create the environment. This initializes the repository, and starts
    # up the page server and the safekeepers
    env = neon_env_builder.init_start()

    # Run the test
    ...
```

The env includes a default tenant and timeline. Therefore, you do not need to create your own
tenant/timeline for testing.

```python
def test_foobar2(neon_env_builder: NeonEnvBuilder):
    env = neon_env_builder.init_start() # Start the environment
    with env.endpoints.create_start("main") as endpoint:
        # Start the compute endpoint
    client = env.pageserver.http_client() # Get the pageserver client

    tenant_id = env.initial_tenant
    timeline_id = env.initial_timeline
    client.timeline_detail(tenant_id=tenant_id, timeline_id=timeline_id)
```

All the test which rely on NeonEnvBuilder, can check the various version combinations of the components.
To do this yuo may want to add the parametrize decorator with the function fixtures.utils.allpairs_versions()
E.g.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(**fixtures.utils.allpairs_versions())
def test_something(
...
```

For more information about pytest fixtures, see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html

At the end of a test, all the nodes in the environment are automatically stopped, so you
don't need to worry about cleaning up. Logs and test data are preserved for the analysis,
in a directory under `../test_output/<testname>`

### Before submitting a patch
Ensure that you pass all [obligatory checks](/docs/sourcetree.md#obligatory-checks).

Also consider:

* Writing a couple of docstrings to clarify the reasoning behind a new test.
* Adding more type hints to your code to avoid `Any`, especially:
  * For fixture parameters, they are not automatically deduced.
  * For function arguments and return values.

# Content from file ../neon/test_runner/performance/README.md:

# Running locally

First make a release build. The `-s` flag silences a lot of output, and makes it
easier to see if you have compile errors without scrolling up.
`BUILD_TYPE=release CARGO_BUILD_FLAGS="--features=testing" make -s -j8`

You may also need to run `./scripts/pysync`.

Then run the tests
`DEFAULT_PG_VERSION=16 NEON_BIN=./target/release poetry run pytest test_runner/performance`

Some handy pytest flags for local development:
- `-x` tells pytest to stop on first error
- `-s` shows test output
- `-k` selects a test to run
- `--timeout=0` disables our default timeout of 300s (see `setup.cfg`)
- `--preserve-database-files` to skip cleanup
- `--out-dir` to produce a JSON with the recorded test metrics

# What performance tests do we have and how we run them

Performance tests are built using the same infrastructure as our usual python integration tests. There are some extra fixtures that help to collect performance metrics, and to run tests against both vanilla PostgreSQL and Neon for comparison.

## Tests that are run against local installation

Most of the performance tests run against a local installation. This is not very representative of a production environment. Firstly, Postgres, safekeeper(s) and the pageserver have to share CPU and I/O resources, which can add noise to the results. Secondly, network overhead is eliminated.

In the CI, the performance tests are run in the same environment as the other integration tests. We don't have control over the host that the CI runs on, so the environment may vary widely from one run to another, which makes the results across different runs noisy to compare.

## Remote tests

There are a few tests that marked with `pytest.mark.remote_cluster`. These tests do not set up a local environment, and instead require a libpq connection string to connect to. So they can be run on any Postgres compatible database. Currently, the CI runs these tests on our staging and captest environments daily. Those are not an isolated environments, so there can be noise in the results due to activity of other clusters.

## Noise

All tests run only once. Usually to obtain more consistent performance numbers, a test should be repeated multiple times and the results be aggregated, for example by taking min, max, avg, or median.

## Results collection

Local test results for main branch, and results of daily performance tests, are stored in a [neon project](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects/withered-sky-69117821) deployed in production environment. There is a Grafana dashboard that visualizes the results. Here is the [dashboard](https://observer.zenith.tech/d/DGKBm9Jnz/perf-test-results?orgId=1). The main problem with it is the unavailability to point at particular commit, though the data for that is available in the database. Needs some tweaking from someone who knows Grafana tricks.

There is also an inconsistency in test naming. Test name should be the same across platforms, and results can be differentiated by the platform field. But currently, platform is sometimes included in test name because of the way how parametrization works in pytest. I.e. there is a platform switch in the dashboard with neon-local-ci and neon-staging variants. I.e. some tests under neon-local-ci value for a platform switch are displayed as `Test test_runner/performance/test_bulk_insert.py::test_bulk_insert[vanilla]` and `Test test_runner/performance/test_bulk_insert.py::test_bulk_insert[neon]` which is highly confusing.


# Content from file ../neon/test_runner/performance/pageserver/README.md:

How to reproduce benchmark results / run these benchmarks interactively.

1. Get an EC2 instance with Instance Store. Use the same instance type as used for the benchmark run.
2. Mount the Instance Store => `neon.git/scripts/ps_ec2_setup_instance_store`
3. Use a pytest command line (see other READMEs further up in the pytest hierarchy).

For tests that take a long time to set up / consume a lot of storage space,
we use the test suite's repo_dir snapshotting functionality (`from_repo_dir`).
It supports mounting snapshots using overlayfs, which improves iteration time.

To add a new SQL test:

- add sql script to run to neon_regress/sql/testname.sql
- add expected output to neon_regress/expected/testname.out
- add testname to parallel_schedule

That's it.
